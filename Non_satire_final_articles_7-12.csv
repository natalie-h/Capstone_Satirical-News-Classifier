Spain and Portugal are through to the World Cup knockout stage after holding off their less-heralded opponents in Group B on Monday.

Both of their matches finished with a draw -- Spain scored a late goal to tie Morocco 2-2, and Portugal tied Iran 1-1 -- but it was all they needed to advance.

Spain and Portugal finish Group B with the same amount of points (5), and they are level on goal differential (+1). But Spain wins the group on account of the next tiebreaker, goals scored.

Spain will play the host nation, Russia, in the round of 16. Portugal's next match will be against Uruguay, which won Group A on Monday by dispatching the Russians 3-0.

1,1,2018-06-24 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Jerusalem (CNN) The Duke of Cambridge faces perhaps his biggest international test to date in his trip to the Middle East, where he will have to juggle politics, diplomacy and royalty. British royal visits usually try to stay above politics, but any foray into this region is inherently political.

The first stop on Prince William's trip ought to be the easiest stint -- perhaps the only easy part. His two-day itinerary in Jordan, the Hashemite Kingdom, starts Sunday and includes a number of meetings and events with children, a focus of the royal visit. His wife, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, who gave birth to their third child in late April , will not be joining him on the visit.

The highlight of the leg in Jordan will happen Sunday, when Prince William meets Crown Prince Hussein, the son of Jordan's King Abdullah II. It's the first time the two young leaders will meet and both royal households no doubt hope it will build a relationship that will be significant in the years to come.

Intense scrutiny

On Monday night, Prince William will leave Jordan and head for Israel, where every word uttered by the young royal will be scrutinized.

After a Tuesday morning visit to Yad Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust Museum, Prince William will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Reuven Rivlin in successive meetings.

The royal visit to Israel will offer Benjamin Netanyahu a rare reason to smile.

For Netanyahu, the meeting will represent a diplomatic victory.

At a time when Israel is facing international criticism for its use of live fire against Palestinian demonstrators in Gaza and its continued settlement expansion, when the international community has overwhelmingly rejected US President Donald Trump's unilateral recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel , when Israel's plans to demolish the Bedouin community of Khan al-Ahmar have drawn condemnation, the first ever official visit from Britain's royal family is a welcome reprieve, one that adds legitimacy to Netanyahu's government and to Israel as an ally of the United Kingdom. Netanyahu will have reason to smile when the two meet.

Boosting the UK's ties

Back home, the British government will also hope to have reason to smile. As the UK grapples with a deeply uncertain post-Brexit future , it is looking to shore up and deepen relations with up-and-coming countries outside the European Union. Israel is seen as one of those countries that London needs to cultivate, and Prince William's visit is expected to play a part in that drive.

In an effort to maintain balance during his trip, he will meet Palestinian as well as Israeli leaders.

After stops in Tel Aviv, Jaffa and Jerusalem, Prince William will go to Ramallah in the West Bank, where he will meet Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Palestinian leaders have demanded an apology for the Balfour Declaration, the seminal 1917 letter from the British foreign secretary that endorsed the creation of a Jewish state. Once again Prince William's words and statements will be picked apart.

Already, the Prince has found himself the target of Israeli criticism. In describing his visit to Jerusalem's Old City, a statement from Kensington Palace labeled the Old City as located in occupied Palestinian territory. That coincides with the language of the international consensus and international law, which hold that East Jerusalem and the West Bank are Israeli-occupied territory.

But Israel holds a united Jerusalem as its capital and Ze'ev Elkin, a leading candidate for mayor of the city, said this week on Twitter: ""A united Jerusalem has been the capital of Israel for more than 3,000 years. No distortion in preparatory pages for a tour like this or otherwise can change that reality,"" referring to the trip itinerary from Kensington Palace.

But Palestinians insist that the eastern part of Jerusalem will one day be the capital of their future state, a position supported by the international community. Palestinian leaders will be listening closely to see how the Prince addresses their aspirations.

It is into this cauldron that Prince William will enter, and a lifetime of royal training will be put to the test.",Prince William's Mideast tour will be his toughest trip yet,http://cnn.com/2018/06/24/middleeast/prince-william-middle-east-tour-intl/index.html
2,2,2018-06-15 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Melbourne, Australia (CNN) The murder of a 22-year-old Australian comedian has ignited a debate in the country about the safety of women and the right to be able to walk home at night without fear of attack.

Eurydice Dixon was raped and killed as she walked home from a performance Tuesday night through a popular park in the inner-city Melbourne suburb of Carlton North.

The attack stunned the community not only because it happened in what's considered a relatively safe city, but because of the police advice that followed.

After informing residents there would be 24-hour patrols at Princes Park where Dixon's body was found, Victoria Police Superintendent David Clayton advised residents to ""take responsibility for your own safety.""

Some interpreted his words as victim-blaming, that Dixon was somehow at fault for walking home by herself at night.

A 19-year-old-man was charged with her rape and murder Thursday.

Among tributes to the young comedian there was growing outcry on social media who called for the blame to be placed squarely on her attacker.

When I was a 22 year old comedian, I constantly walked home alone from gigs in the middle of the night because I couldn't afford tram fare, let alone taxis.

""When I was a 22-year-old comedian, I constantly walked home from gigs along in the middle of the night because I couldn't afford the tram fare, let alone taxis,"" broadcaster Meshel Laurie said on Twitter. ""Should we allow murderous rapists and poverty to ensure we're locked inside our entire lives?""

Bernard Keane, a leading political writer based in Canberra said the ""victim blaming"" from police was ""garbage.""

""Men don't let women be safe anywhere,"" he tweeted.

It's a tiny consolation about a man's murder of Eurydice Dixon to see the ferocious pushback against the victim-blaming garbage from police and media about ""staying safe"". Men don't let women be safe anywhere. — Bernard Keane (@BernardKeane) June 14, 2018

Influential Australian feminist writer Clementine Ford said it wasn't a lack of ""situational awareness"" that ended the life of Dixon. ""It was a person who made a conscious decision to exercise extreme violence against her,"" she said.

Victoria Police Minister Lisa Neville addressed the outcry in a news conference Friday, saying the role of the police was to ensure people are aware of the risks around them.

""Just as it's touched and hurt our community and the family it also touches our police as well, that's why they want to make sure women understand the risks while we fight to ensure we have safety within our communities and our homes,"" she said.

For two days local residents have been laying flowers at Princes Park, where Dixon's body was found.

Victorian State Premier Daniel Andrews said a public vigil would be held at the park on Monday at 5.40 p.m. local time, and those taking part would recognize that Dixon wasn't to blame.

""They will do so in firm knowledge that Eurydice died because of her attacker's decisions - not because of her own. They're right. And we need to accept that fact too. We will never change a thing until we do,"" he tweeted.

In a few days, women across Melbourne will hold a vigil in Princes Park for the life of Eurydice Dixon.

Jaymes Todd, a 19-year-old man from the north-western suburb of Broadmeadows has been charged with Dixon's rape and murder

He was arrested on Wednesday night after handing himself into authorities after police released images of a man they wanted to speak to about Dixon's death.

Todd appeared in Melbourne Magistrates Court Thursday where it was heard Dixon was killed between 10:30 p.m. on Tuesday and 3:00 a.m. on Wednesday, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported.

John Riordan, a Victoria Legal Aid lawyer, told court it was Todd's first time in custody and that he was highly vulnerable due to his young age and autism disorder.

The lawyer successfully argued that images of Todd should not be published until more information on his condition was examined. Todd did not apply for bail and was remanded in custody to reappear on October 3, the ABC reported.

Dixon's death and public reaction strongly echoes the horrific rape and murder of Gill Meagher, a 29-year-old Irish woman living in Melbourne who was killed when walking home in the early hours of September 22, 2012.

3,3,2018-06-22 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) The Hungarian State Opera has canceled a third of its performances of the stage musical ""Billy Elliot"" for this month and July amid criticism by a pro-government media outlet that the play could turn Hungarian boys gay.

In a statement, the opera said that the press reports had resulted in ""reduced interest"" and that 15 out of the 44 performances would no longer go ahead.

The musical, adapted from a 2000 British movie of the same name , tells the story of a boy who grows up in poverty and finds refuge in ballet.

The criticism in Hungary has been driven by Magyor Idok, a news website that openly supports right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban

In an opinion piece published on the website this month, a contributor named Zsofia N. Horvath accused the State Opera of disseminating ""rampant gay propaganda.""

""The propagation of homosexuality cannot be a national goal when the population is getting older and smaller and our country is threatened by invasion,"" the article said.

""Our government is trying to ... help family prosperity with a lot of tools and money, so it's inexplicable and intolerable that a leading state institution is going against this intention and that it makes quite a few youngsters miserable, who would have not gone this direction by themselves.""

Asked whether the piece reflected the views of the website, a representative referred CNN to the editor, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A day after the article appeared, the site published a response from Szilveszter Okovacs, director general of the Hungarian State Opera, who criticized the piece.

CNN has asked the Prime Minister's office whether Orban or his staff had any role in the website's campaign or whether it supported it.

4,4,2018-06-22 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) He was touted as the savior of English rugby, but at the moment Eddie Jones is searching for a second coming as England coach.

The 58-year-old Australian -- with the no-nonsense attitude, the deep well of pithy retorts, and the winning rugby resume -- is under fire.

Before Saturday's third Test 25-10 win over South Africa, England had lost its previous five matches. It was a run that contributed to the 2-1 series defeat in South Africa.

But Jones remains as combative as ever.

""These are the periods you look forward to where everyone thinks you're done and you have to find a way to win,"" he told reporters ahead of the third Test in South Africa.

""I'm enjoying it, loving it, absolutely loving it. Every job is the same. When you are doing well, everyone pats you on the back. When you are not doing well you're pulling knives out of your back. That's the reality of it.""

For many observers, however, the much-traveled Jones is on borrowed time.

Eddie Jones, the England head coach, is pictured in South Africa.

Ups and downs

The Tasmania-born Jones was appointed following England's disastrous showing at the 2015 World Cup, having masterminded Japan's shock victory against South Africa in the pool stage.

The win for the ""Cherry Blossoms"" enhanced the reputation of the street-wise coach who took Australia to the final of the World Cup in 2003, only to lose to Clive Woodward's England. He was also an advisor to the World Cup-winning South Africa side in 2007, largely credited with inspiring the Springboks back play.

A former player -- at hooker -- with Sydney's Randwick and then New South Wales, Jones gave up his job in teaching to go into coaching. He began at Randwick before moving to Japan -- land of his mother's birth -- eventually becoming assistant for the Japanese national side.

Back in Australia, his first big club coaching role came with the ACT Brumbies, who he guided to the Super 12 title in 2001.

He took over Australia shortly after, but following the highs of the World Cup final, the Wallabies hit a slump and Jones' contract was terminated in 2005.

There were other lows, too. Jones had a torrid time at the Queensland Reds in 2007, finishing bottom of the league. And after early promise, he aborted a stint with English club side Saracens, citing ""personal reasons,"" in 2009.

Lapping it up

Returning to Japan, he took over as the national coach and revamped the set-up. His approach paid dividends, culminating in that spectacular 34-32 World Cup win over the Springboks.

After the tournament Jones took up a post with South African side Stormers, but after eight days England came calling for a replacement for embattled Word Cup coach Stuart Lancaster.

The impish Jones couldn't resist taking the reins of his old foe.

It seemed like the perfect fit. Jones wielded a broom among the established backroom staff, upped the fitness training and instilled a winning mentality.

He brought former England lock Steve Borthwick with him from the Japan set-up and took on Paul Gustard as another of his assistants. The attitude mirrored Jones -- hard-nosed and ruthless -- and the transformed team quickly clinched a first grand slam since 2003.

The English rugby public were lapping it up. Every interview with Jones, eyes sparkling, threw up another great one-liner.

That summer England toured Australia and beat the Wallabies 3-0. For Jones, a coach for hire, there was no emotion in beating his homeland, only satisfaction at a job done.

Jones (right) looks on during an England training session in South Africa.

Back against the wall

England won all its matches that autumn to end the year unbeaten. Jones' men went into the 2017 Six Nations on a roll. But the first chink in the armour came when they lost the grand slam decider to Ireland in Dublin. England still won the Six Nations, but the defeat ended an 18-match winning streak.

This season, England only won two of its five games for its worst Six Nations finish.

Questions were beginning to be asked. A leaked video from a private corporate event showed Jones making disparaging remarks about Ireland and Wales. The heat was turned up on Jones, who had to issue an apology.

Rumours of discontent behind the scenes were rife, fueled by the decision of Gustard to leave to take up a role with Harlequins. Training regimes, which seemed to result in an unusually high number of injuries, were also questioned.

As defeats piled up, Jones met media inquisitors with increasing brevity and sarcasm. Two further defeats in South Africa have just increased the intensity.

After the England's first Test defeat by South Africa, Jones was also involved in a verbal spat with South African fans. ""They've always got something to say here,"" Jones told Sky Sports.

The England coach later told reporters: ""I asked the fan where I can get a good bottle of Pinotage and I'm still waiting for the answer. If someone can help me out, please help me out.""

Detractors say it is history repeating itself. The Rugby Football Union insists it has no plans to review Jones' position.

But with just 15 months until the next World Cup, the Australian's back is firmly against the wall.

8,8,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Daily insulin shots for the management of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes could become a thing of the past, and insulin pills could someday be another option for diabetes patients.

In people with Type 1 diabetes , the pancreas does not make insulin -- a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells to give them energy -- which is why they take insulin. In people with Type 2 diabetes , the body does not make or use insulin well, and so insulin therapy may be needed.

Yet there have been several research efforts around the world to develop pills as another way to take insulin. These efforts are ongoing, but if any are found to be safe and effective, they could change the daily well-being of the more than 400 million people living with diabetes worldwide. About 40% of them rely on insulin injections.

""Insulin is currently given primarily by injections, which is a challenge for Type 1 diabetics and a deterrent for Type 2 diabetic patients to switch to insulin. An oral pill for insulin will make it easier for the patients to take insulin,"" said Samir Mitragotri, a professor of bioengineering and biologically inspired engineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences

Developing insulin that patients can ingest remains a scientific challenge because insulin can be degraded in the stomach by acids and enzymes before it's used in the body, Mitragotri said.

In other words, insulin has to survive the hostile environment of your digestive system.

""Even if some insulin makes it into the intestine, it cannot cross the intestinal wall, since the wall is designed to prevent the transport of proteins,"" Mitragotri said.

""The mucus layer present on the wall of the intestine also makes transport of insulin from the intestine into the blood stream very challenging,"" he said. ""Collectively, these hurdles make oral delivery of insulin very difficult.""

The science behind insulin you can swallow

Mitragotri was senior author of a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that described how a new liquid formulation of insulin inside an enterically coated capsule was capable of lowering blood glucose levels in rats.

Enterically coated means the coating can be dissolved only in the body's small intestine.

For the study, researchers gave six nondiabetic male rats an oral insulin capsule and three nondiabetic male rats traditional injections of insulin.

The researchers found that blood glucose levels rapidly dropped 38% in the rats given capsules within two hours and slowly but steadily continued to fall, dropping 45% by 10 hours.

In comparison, blood glucose levels sharply dropped 49% within one hour in the rats given injections. Levels then rose, which is a typical response in nondiabetic rats, before continuing to decrease in a typical pattern.

""Oral delivery of insulin has been challenging. The study demonstrates a new technology to overcome these challenges,"" Mitragotri said.

""The next step is to perform longer-term safety studies and efficacy testing in larger animals,"" he said. ""These studies will provide the necessary information to support human clinical testing, which we hope will begin in three to five years.""

That study was just the latest to experiment with creating an insulin pill; many others do involve testing in humans.

Last month, Oramed Pharmaceuticals launched its largest and most advanced clinical trial of its own oral insulin pill, under the direction of the US Food and Drug Administration. The trial involves 240 patients with Type 2 diabetes.

""A year from now we will better know the potential of our drug to control and maintain blood glucose levels and will have further proof of the longer-term benefits of taking an oral pill versus an injection,"" Oramed CEO Nadav Kidron said in a news release in May.

Insulin you can swallow also has been studied as a possible way to either hold off or prevent the development of Type 1 diabetes, but this approach has been found to be ineffective in human clinical studies.

In a separate study published in the journal JAMA in November, researchers examined whether a type of oral insulin capsule can delay or prevent the development of Type 1 diabetes in the relatives of patients with the disease, who are therefore themselves at a higher risk of developing it, over a 2.7-year period.

That study involved 560 people, some of whom were given an insulin capsule and others who were were given a placebo pill.

Though some participants given the insulin capsule had a longer time before being diagnosed with diabetes, overall, ""these findings do not support oral insulin as used in this study for diabetes prevention,"" the researchers wrote.

Many questions remain

The future of insulin therapy is among the research topics on the agenda at the annual scientific conference of the American Diabetes Association this week in Florida.

Research on the oral administration of insulin dates back decades.

One study published in the journal Diabetes in 1988 involved administering nanocapsules of insulin to rats. It found that the capsules preserved the therapeutic effect of insulin when administered.

Still, more research is needed to better understand the possible risks that could come with insulin pills. In general, insulin therapy causes changes in blood sugar , so symptoms of low and high blood sugar could emerge, as seen with insulin injections.

Some studies suggest that use of insulin might be linked with increased risk of cancer , but of course more research is also needed to determine whether such a relationship could emerge with the use of insulin pills.

These pills are far from proven, but they are staking a claim as a possible new avenue for diabetes care.",Insulin pill instead of shot,http://cnn.com/2018/06/25/health/insulin-pill-diabetes-study/index.html

The traffickers were attempting to exploit relaxed entry rules into Russia ahead of the 2018 World Cup, according to the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP).

Nine young girls and one boy were rescued and each child was in possession of a FIFA Fan ID, to take advantage of the fact that Russia is allowing travelers to enter the country with only a FIFA pass before and during the World Cup, NAPTIP said.

The children were intercepted Saturday as they tried to board a Moscow-bound flight in Lagos.

10,10,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) President Donald Trump probably isn't going to be heckled at a restaurant any time soon -- since when he does go out to eat, he usually owns the place.

And he's no stranger to a good old-fashioned boycott, having called for boycotts on media organizations and the NFL and been the subject of boycott campaigns as a candidate

But he's sticking up bigly for Sarah Sanders, his press secretary who was asked to leave a restaurant in Lexington, Virginia, and then tweeted about it.

Trump answered the incivility against Sanders with an incivility of his own, criticizing the restaurant's cleanliness.

""The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders,"" Donald Trump tweeted. ""I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside!""

As this episode shows, we seem to be in a moment of degraded discourse. Which should surprise exactly no one in a time when the President uses the the imagery of invaders and infestation to describe immigrants and those who oppose him continue to treat his presidency as post-apocalyptic.

Warlike language is going to get nasty.

Rep. Maxine Waters encouraged members of the Trump opposition to essentially play a little dirty to make life difficult for people who work for the President.

""Let's make sure we show up wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them. And you tell them they're not welcome any more, anywhere. We've got to get the children connected to their parents,"" Waters said at the Wilshire Federal Building, according to video of the event.

Democrats like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Waters' statements ""unacceptable,"" but blamed it all on Trump's lack of civility.

Trump, by the way, fired back at Waters, too, saying on Twitter she was encouraging violence and calling her ""low IQ"" and shooting back what seemed like an invitation for his own supporters to heckle her. ""Be careful what you wish for Max!""

Sanders ignored her own boss' broadside when she opened her briefing with reporters Monday talking about being asked to leave the restaurant and also an attack against first lady Melania Trump by Peter Fonda on Twitter last week.

""Healthy debate on ideas and political philosophy is important, but the calls for harassment and push for any Trump supporter to avoid the public is unacceptable,"" she said at Monday's press briefing. ""America is a great country and our ability to find solutions despite those disagreements is what makes us unique.""

A good amount of this tone has sprung from the President's Twitter account. He's encouraged scorched-earth opposition, particularly against the news media.

A large majority thinks civility has taken a trip out of town in the Trump years. Back in November of 2017 a Marist poll asked , ""Since Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, do you think the overall tone and level of civility in Washington between Republicans and Democrats has improved, stayed the same, or gotten worse?"" Sixty-seven percent of Americans said it had gotten worse, and that included 60% of Republicans.

And it should be no surprise that as activists and media organizations use ever more intense rhetoric to describe the actions of the President; when families are literally being separated at the border, that civility should be hard to maintain.

And that's why Trump administration officials and staffers, even before Waters' statements, have recently been:

There's obviously a big difference between not being able to get a date and being publicly called out by members of your church. But if there's a sliding scale of incivility, there's space on there for a lot of things.

If you use language of war to describe undocumented immigrants as invaders trying to take over the country, you will likely get a militant response from people who feel very strongly that immigrants are not an invading horde.

A good example of how the sliding scale of incivility can affect a Trump administration official is Vice President Mike Pence.

When he was singled out and lectured in the opening days of the Trump administration by the cast of the Broadway musical Hamilton, that was done mostly respectfully. They were asking him to pay attention to people afraid of the new administration. But those were early days. Pence stayed silent and Trump went after the Hamilton cast on his behalf.

Pence was on the other side of the equation when he walked out in disgust from an NFL game due to athletes kneeling for the National Anthem -- that should probably go on the incivility scale too.

11,11,2018-04-09 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Winning is everything in elections, but expectations can make a tough loss feel like a gut punch or a surprise victory the thing of legend.

Pretty much nobody, including his own staff, thought Donald Trump was going to beat Hillary Clinton in 2016, which made his victory all the more surprising.

We're starting to see perceptions of a new lock in 2018: that Democrats will see a wave and take control of the House of Representatives.

And that could be both good and bad news for them.

There's a good probability that so many people assumed Clinton would win in 2016 that they didn't turn out to vote. In hindsight, they might have. That's conjecture, of course, but it's not a radical idea to say that if Clinton had been seen as less of a lock, she might have generated more excitement.

But maybe because of that shocking loss, and with Trump in the White House, Democrats won't have to worry about setting lower expectations in 2018, according to Steve Israel, a former New York congressman who chaired the committee in charge of electing Democrats from 2011 thru 2015.

He said Democrats have ""nuclear energy"" right now.

""In environments like this, we used to worry that high expectations would lead to voter complacency,"" he said. ""But 2018 has generated the equivalent of nuclear energy for Democrats. They're not staying home on Election Day, they're rushing to the polls. What Republicans are doing is bracing their donors for the worst, so that anything better than catastrophe can be spun as a victory.""

Republicans, it's true, are predicting a wave could upend their majorities.

The House, where every seat is up for election, is much more likely to change hands than the Senate, where Democrats are defending 26 seats and Republicans are defending only eight.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, was using hurricane terminology

""This is going to be a challenging election year,"" McConnell told members of the Kentucky Today editorial board on Tuesday. ""We know the wind is going to be in our face. We don't know whether it's going to be a Category 3, 4 or 5.""

There is a very long list of reasons for Democrats to be optimistic. Here's one that CNN Political Director David Chalian rattled off:

Despite all of that, Democrats say they won't be coasting into November.

""Here's the bottom line: There's nothing easy about winning 23 seats under the current gerrymandered maps -- in the face of massive outside Republican spending -- and we're taking nothing for granted,"" said Tyler Law, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's spokesman.

There's no doubt both parties will be working hard, but the problem for Democrats could be beyond their control in some ways, especially if the press and the public start to expect a Democratic takeover of the House.

Most Democrats think there's good reason for that expectation, at least right now.

""If the elections were held tomorrow, I think we would take back the house,"" said Rodell Mollineau, a former top Democratic Senate staffer and former president of the super PAC American Bridge 21st Century.

But he cautioned that political winds can change and pointed to the 2014 midterms, when Democrats felt good early on but Republicans ultimately saw gains in the Senate and House. He pointed out that national security issues, including ISIS and an Ebola outbreak, changed momentum during the campaign.

""There's always danger in complacency,"" he said, adding, ""There are some things that are out of the control of Republicans and Democrats and especially on the House side that will contribute to voters' opinions.""

In that vein, Democrats want to make the election about the more sensational aspects of Trump and his administration, his effort to dismantle Obamacare and the details of the unpopular tax law.

But Republicans, led by Trump, will try to make it about immigration and stoke the fears of the same voters who put him in office. The beginnings of that effort apparently came last week as the President turned to provocative rhetoric about the southern border.

13,13,2018-06-19 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) It was in the thick of the Arab Spring in 2011 when Manal al-Sharif first had herself recorded driving in Saudi Arabia. ""You can have a PhD here and still not know how to drive,"" says Sharif during an eight-minute video about Saudi Arabia's female driving ban.

She recalls when she hired a driver, despite her international driver's license. A week after he started to work for her family, he dented her car. Shortly after that, he began to harass her.

""They say you are a queen -- you are a queen. You are a jewel,"" she says, echoing language used by the kingdom's conservatives in support of the ban. ""It's humiliating -- yes, it's humiliating ... and not everyone can afford to hire a driver.""

She uploaded the video of herself driving -- seemingly unnoticed -- through the streets of Saudi Arabia's Khobar, and was subsequently jailed for nine days. Months later, in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Sharif said she was determined to lay the ""foundations"" of change.

""The previous generation couldn't change our present, so we decided to change the next generation's future and that happens now. If that doesn't happen in our age, at least this movement will cast the foundation for those generations to come,"" she said in the 2012 interview.

She could not have known that change would come in her lifetime, expedited by the rapid rise of a young, ambitious prince determined to modernize the ultraconservative kingdom. But she and some of her fellow activists say they hoped that it would have played out differently.

For them, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 32, has carried the mantle of their causes while stamping out the activists, erasing decades of protest from Saudi history.

On June 24, Saudi Arabia will no longer be the only country in the world to bar women from driving. For the first time ever, women will legally get behind the wheel in the kingdom. A staple of the Crown Prince's modernization campaign, the lifting of the driving ban comes 28 years after Saudi women first took to the streets of Riyadh to protest for the right to drive.

Decades of protest

Last month, Saudi security forces arrested at least 12 activists, according to rights groups, many of them prominent advocates for lifting the ban. They were accused of ""suspicious contact with foreign entities,"" according to a statement on Saudi Arabia's official news agency. Government-aligned newspapers said they were faced with counterterror charges punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Four were later released.

Manal al-Sharif, who was out of the country, wasn't among those arrested but she said the arrests marked a return to a ""climate of fear"" in Saudi Arabia. The government's defenders said the move was necessary to quell conservative dissent on June 24. Analysts said the arrests were an attempt to deprive the activists of credit for the lifting of the ban.

""The arrests of women in connection with this coming step forward would seem designed to deny those women the credit for having pushed for those reforms and for it being possible for Prince Mohammed and those around him to say, 'This is our gift. This is the men who have given this to women,'"" said British historian Robert Lacey, the author of ""Inside the Kingdom.""

""Even as women are being given the right to drive, which they should have had years ago, women are being locked up,"" Lacey added.

The first demonstrations for women's right to drive in Saudi Arabia began in earnest after the Gulf War. Female American soldiers, deployed to the kingdom during Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, were driving through military bases, exciting the imaginations of Saudi women.

In November 1990, 47 Saudi women drove through the streets of Riyadh in a motorcade protest. They were all arrested, and the country's highest religious body issued an edict banning female driving, adding what was a customary ban to the legal code.

This Nov. 30, 2014 image was taken from a video released by Loujain al-Hathloul that shows her driving toward the Saudi-United Arab Emirates border. She was later arrested and detained for 73 days.

Reports at the time described the women, nearly completely veiled except for their eyes, getting into 15 cars and driving through the capital. They had all driven before but didn't know how to operate their own cars.

The decades that followed the Riyadh protest were peppered with movements to lift the ban, but they really came to a head around the time of the Arab Spring in 2011. A social-media campaign called Women2Drive culminated in Manal al-Sharif's drive in Khobar. Some years later, other activists emerged at the forefront of the movement.

Loujain al-Hathloul was detained for 73 days in 2014 after trying to drive from the United Arab Emirates to Saudi Arabia. Aziza al-Yousef, who is 70 and one of the country's earliest activists, and Eman al-Nafjan, a well-known blogger, drove in Riyadh in 2013 as part of a protest that attracted international attention. They were all arrested in the recent sweep that targeted women's rights groups, of which Saudi authorities had long been relatively tolerant.

'Lip service' to Saudi conservatives

Before bin Salman's ascent to power in recent years, Saudi Arabia's largely fundamentalist clergy wielded considerable influence. The arrest of some prominent religious figures in recent months, in addition to a series of moves that consolidated the Crown Prince's grip on decision-making, helped to clip the clerics' power.

Over the past year, Saudi Arabia opened its first cinema in decades and loosened several morality laws that discriminate against women, including its notorious rules requiring that women receive a male guardian's permission to travel, receive an education and sometimes work and receive health care.

""Saudi Arabia was a car driving at 30 kph and the drivers were elderly monarchs who were very cautious and avoided risk. Saudi Arabia today is driving at 100 kph with Mohammed bin Salman in the driver's seat. And he's willing to take more risk,"" said Ali Shihabi, founder of the Washington-based Arabia Foundation.

He said the activists' arrests were aimed at achieving a ""balancing act"" with the kingdom's conservatives.

""If there are activists on the women's section, there will be activists on the Islamists section and then they'll say, 'Why are you arresting clerics when these girls are doing X, Y, Z? Is it just because the Americans like them and they're being celebrated in the West?'"" said Shihabi.

The Crown Prince, activists and analysts argue, has made no secret that reforms will continue to be dictated exclusively from above, dividing local and international opinion alike.

A longtime female activist who declined to be identified for security reasons said the arrests have caused a rift in Saudi society, calling the sweep ""unprecedented and quite vicious.""

""When we first heard of all the changes by MBS, I think we were all enthusiastic and happy because, obviously, these were steps in the right direction,"" said author Robert Lacey, referring to the Crown Prince by his initials.

""While he offers these changes -- which are admittedly bigger than cosmetic and will change the nature of society and improve many people's lives including women's lives -- everybody in Saudi Arabia is being treated as a child with the idea that the house of Saud will rule absolutely forever,"" he added.

Meanwhile, those women's rights activists who heralded change have been asked by authorities not to speak to the media and many have closed their social-media accounts, according to multiple activists. Those arrested, branded ""traitors"" by state-aligned media, are ostracized by Saudi society even as it treads into modernity.

""We are back to square one,"" Manal al-Sharif told CNN shortly after the activists' arrests were announced.

""This is really, really shocking. I had much hope for the country,"" Sharif said.

Under heavy security, the South Jakarta District Court found Aman Abdurrahman, the leader of the ISIS-affiliated Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) militant group, guilty of inciting five terror attacks, including a January 2016 attack in which four people were killed and 25 wounded by a suicide bomber and gunmen in central Jakarta.

His lawyer, Asludin Hatjani, said that he had met the cleric Friday morning before court proceedings began, and Abdurrahman had told him he would ""praise God"" if he was sentenced to death. Abdurrahman has the right to appeal, and Hatjani says he will consult with his client to determine whether they will exercise that right.

Abdurrahman prostrated himself on the floor of the courtroom as the sentence was read out.

(CNN) Odds are, you are trying to break a bad habit or institute a good one right now. As a species, we are impressively committed to self-improvement, and most of us believe that habits are an effective means to that end.

Habits -- actions performed with little conscious thought and often unwittingly triggered by external cues -- are powerful influences on behavior and can be our greatest allies for positive change. But because they are so difficult to break, habits are also frequent saboteurs of personal progress.

""Habit is a good servant but a bad master"" is how author Gretchen Rubin summed it up in her book ""Better Than Before: Mastering the Habit of Our Everyday Lives."" Hers was one of three recent books I read back-to-back on the subject of habit formation; the others were Charles Duhigg's ""The Power of Habit"" and Jeremy Dean's ""Making Habits, Breaking Habits."" Together, they helped me understand more deeply the importance of habit control, how to choose a habit to begin or end, and the mechanics of sticking with it.

The first thing to know, each book explained, is that a lot of our daily actions are so rote, they are automatic. ""All our life ... is but a mass of habits,"" philosopher and psychologist William James wrote, though a 2006 study put the amount of habitual daily action at 40% . Still, that's a lot of mindless behavior.

It's helpful that we don't need to think about how or when to drink coffee, brush our teeth or drive to work. If we did, we'd waste so much time rethinking or learning those tasks, we'd get little else done.

The whole trick is to get habits to work for you, not against you. Self-control is a limited resource, Dean explains, so a good habit means not having to exert effort every time you need to do the right thing.

Room to grow

The first thing to identify for yourself is the habit you want to work on, whether it's starting a new (good) one or ending an old (bad) one. That's a minor distinction, by the way. Eating healthier is eating less junk. Exercising more is being less sedentary. One is often the inverse of another.

This step requires some honest self-evaluation. What is not working in your life? What personality flaws are holding you back? Where is there room to do better?

We know what many of the most common areas of improvement are, at least when it comes to making resolutions. People want to lose weight, eat better, be more mindful, spend money more wisely, sleep better and improve relationships. By eliminating bad habits and starting new ones, you can succeed in most of these areas.

One helpful checklist frequently used for goal-setting is the acronym SMART, created by economic theorist Peter Drucker. Effective resolutions, research has shown, are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound.

Before finishing the first book (Dean's, which is the most prescriptive and research- and science-based), I decided on two habits to work on myself. The first was to be more present and mindful with my kids. The second was to stop seeking out and consuming free, non-nutritious food at work. One was a good habit to start, the other a bad habit to quit.

Rubin, who approaches the topic personally and looks for specific techniques that work for her, recommends starting a habit at the same time as a big turning point such as pregnancy, marriage, a medical diagnosis, a family death, an anniversary, a long trip or a new year.

Repeal and replace your behavior

The consensus among these books is that the most effective way to adopt a habit is to replace a bad one with a better one. Dean's metaphor is to think of habits as well-worn rivers of action that flow out of the predictable path of your routine. Often, the most effective way to stop it flowing in harmful directions is not by damming it but by diverting it. For example, many people stop smoking by chewing gum.

The point is that bad habits die hard, and as with riding a bike, your brain never stops learning how to do them.

So it's easier to think about any habit formation, even new ""good"" ones, in terms of replacing unwanted behavior. That made sense for my snacking at work. I started buying healthy yet still delicious snacks to keep there: yogurt instead of morning doughnuts, dried papaya instead of chocolate, sweetened rice cakes instead of stale leftover doughnuts. A supply of healthy snack options kept me on a new course of action that largely followed the old eating habit pattern.

To be more mindful with my kids, I needed to avoid the opposite behaviors, such as checking my work phone or planning activities while with them so I could focus on their needs and thoughts.

Duhigg explains that habit ""reversal therapy"" is a legitimate technique used for things like tics and obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as predilections such as gambling, smoking and bed-wetting.

It's important to make a distinction between a bad habit and addiction, however, even if the behaviors seem to overlap. Addiction requires greater intervention than habit hacking.

Dean describes the hallmarks of addiction as not being in control and not being aware of time/energy spent on the behavior. People with addictions are preoccupied with soothing a craving and needing more and more to get the same effect, as well as suffering withdrawal without it. Unlike bad habits, addictions eat away at important activities such as relationships and work. They tend to be an escape from normal life and are often hidden from others.

The wonderful thing about triggers

We like to think we have free will in every situation, but many of our actions are predictably triggered by external situations. And if those events are part of your daily or weekly routine, our Pavlovian tendencies become ingrained. Pajamas are on: Time to floss and brush. Cup of coffee in hand: Time to dunk a doughnut. Beer finished: Let's have a cigarette. But triggers can also be feelings, such as stress or boredom.

Being aware of your triggers is the first step in learning how to keep them from sabotaging you and make them work for you instead. Is there a certain time of day or task when you crave a treat? What do you always do when you feel stress (go for a run or go for a drink)? What is your bedtime ritual to let your brain know it's time to sleep?

You can help create conditions to avoid triggers, but not fully. If the trigger is deeply ingrained, maybe going back years, it will sabotage you when your guard is down. For these situations, you need contingencies. Dean calls them ""If ... then ..."" plans. When trigger X happens, I won't do bad habit Y, as I usually do, but I will replace it with much healthier Z action.

My favorite example of effective trigger planning is Starbucks, a company that puts a higher premium on customer service than on the (habit-fueled) products it sells. Duhigg, who prefers Malcom Gladwell-esque case studies for his book, explains that the chain's baristas are well trained on what to do when something goes wrong, such as a messed-up order that angers a customer. Rather than improvise or consider options in those moments, they practice rapid responses -- such as apologizing and offering a replacement drink for free -- until it's second nature.

You likewise need to have a plan for when a strong, perhaps rare, trigger threatens your winning habit streak. Ordinarily, I can avoid eating cupcakes at work, but what's my plan when I've skipped lunch, it's late afternoon, I have some onerous task that would be made more enjoyable with a treat, and the cupcake is filled with peanut butter?

66 is the magic number

According to one study cited by Dean and Rubin, it takes 66 days of doing something to convert it to a habit. However, that number varies depending on the person and activity. For example, it took those participating in the study less than 20 days to habitualize drinking a glass of water every day, 60 days for eating fruit with lunch and more then 84 days to make 50 sit-ups a daily habit. Some habits could take a year to form. But 66 days is a good target.

I avoided work snacking and improved my capacity for parental mindfulness for 66 days straight. Or rather, I diligently monitored these habits over 66 days, because another pillar of successful habit formation is tracking. Even something as subjective as ""be more present with my kids"" can be numerically self-scored every evening.

And another pro tip of habit-making (or replacing) is accountability. Tell other people. Share on social media (unless social media is the habit you're changing). Ask your friends and family to support the effort. Getting others involved, or even just aware, makes it harder for you to give it up. And others' support can be inspiring and helpful.

Treat yo'self: rewards

Unlike tracking and accountability, incentives are a debatable strategy. Duhigg believes that they are central to the exercise, because habits are reward-based. Rubin concludes that external rewards take you away from internalizing the right motivation behind your new habit.

For me, rewards have been pivotal. Five years ago, I took off 25 pounds and have kept it off by establishing an elaborate reward system

If you do treat yourself for keeping a habit, make sure it's not self-defeating. You may not want to reward, say, avoiding doughnuts by indulging in a half-gallon of ice cream.

And that's one to grow on

At the end of 66 days, I stopped tracking my new habits and found that they had largely stuck. When I came home from work, seeing the faces of my daughters was the trigger to remind me to give them my undivided focus. I rarely (instead of automatically) checked my phone for work updates, and I put off my personal agenda items until after bedtime. And I replaced workplace snacking with my private stash of more nutritious snacks: same trigger, but alternate behavior at much fewer calories.

The real test though, is time. More than six months have passed since my 66 days of daily tracking, and I'm still doing a solid job on mindful parenting. I have occasionally slipped on the work snacking, though. I wouldn't say I've failed at it, because I'm building up a new long-term habit muscle for healthy snacking, and I ate a lot less junk food than I would have without trying.

Rubin would call it ""stumbling,"" and we should accept that it happens in the habit game. Stumbling is not a reason to quit trying.

You may want to read one of the habit books, too. The three overlap and support each other, but my personal preference was for Rubin's, largely because I feel a kinship with her love of life-hacking, introspection and applied psychology.

She's the author of the bestselling ""The Happiness Project"" and wrote this new book, she explained, after concluding that habits were the best means to actually achieve happiness.

But I'll give the last word to the wise Ben Franklin, whose advice would make all these books unnecessary. "" 'Tis easier to prevent bad habits than to break them,"" he wrote.","Start a new (good) habit, kill an old (bad) one",http://cnn.com/2018/01/05/health/habits-wisdom-project/index.html
16,16,2018-06-21 00:00:00,cnn.com,"San Diego (CNN) Not many of us can run a marathon.

Earlier this month, Richard Nares began a run he says will cover 1,700 miles -- the equivalent of 65 marathons. It began in Seattle, will end in San Diego, and along the way, Nares will pause long enough to celebrate his 65th birthday.

For Nares, a 2013 CNN Hero, it's the journey of a lifetime. The run, named Richard's Heart & Sole for Emilio , is intended to raise awareness and money to provide children with cancer free rides to their chemotherapy treatments.

Nares' inspiration is his son, Emilio, who was diagnosed in 1998 with leukemia, when he was just 3 years old.

Months of chemotherapy followed, and Nares met other families who were struggling to get their children to the hospital for treatments, often several times a week. Many had no reliable, affordable transportation.

After Emilio passed away, just before his sixth birthday, Richard and his wife, Diane, founded the Emilio Nares Foundation to honor his memory and to help other children in need.

At first, Nares did all the driving. The children and families he served often lived in poverty and had no car or money for transportation. The requests kept coming, and today, 15 years after the nonprofit was founded, Nares and his group have provided more than 33,000 rides.

In addition to free transportation, the group offers support services and other resources to families. The nonprofit launched a healthy eating program and is planning to expand its services to children's hospitals along the West Coast.

As he makes his way south through Oregon and California, Nares will stop at several children's hospitals. At each one, he will present a T-shirt he designed to make children more comfortable while they receive treatment.

Called ""Emilio's Loving Tabs"" shirts, they're equipped with a special shoulder panel that provides medical staff administering chemotherapy easy access to a child's chest catheter port, without requiring them to lift up or remove their clothes.

By summer's end, Nares hopes to raise $250,000 for the foundation.

CNN's Allie Torgan spoke with Nares about the run. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: You're trying to get from Seattle to San Diego on foot. How do you train for this, and how long will it take?

Richard Nares: I've been training since October, and it's a gradual buildup of miles. I've run 1,352 miles for training so far. The run is going to take roughly 10 and a half weeks and 1,700 miles. And that will equate to about 30 miles a day, six days a week.

CNN: Tell me more about the T-shirts you are delivering to kids in children's hospitals on the way?

Nares: We are starting at Seattle Children's Hospital and we are going to present nine children's hospitals that are along my route with ""Emilio's Loving Tabs"" T-shirts. The shirt is a breathable texture and is very comfortable -- like a runner's shirt. It has snaps on one shoulder and down one sleeve -- and with those snaps, when it opens up, it provides access to a child's port-a-cath or Hickman catheter, and that's where they receive chemo or have blood drawn.

The T-shirt is such a simple idea. Families who have kids with cancer know what impact it has. They have to go through treatment for two and a half to three years, so if we can provide a sense of comfort and less stress to the patient and family, we're doing a wonderful thing.

CNN: Where did you get the idea for the T-shirts?

Richard Nares: It always comes back to Emilio, because through our journey with him, I saw how difficult the treatment was for him to be accessed. He was only 3 years old, but I saw the fear and the anguish every time he had to have the access in his port-a-cath to get chemo or have blood drawn. It was really very frightening for him and stressful to us.

With this shirt, it's a real game changer, because the snaps open and allows doctors and nurses easy access. We believe that a child who has to fight this horrible disease and fight for their life, they should be able to have some comfort and a sense of normalcy, so that's what this shirt provides.

It's our duty to provide this comfort, and seeing it and living it, I know what an impact it can make.

CNN: How do you stay motivated when you run? Do you listen to music?

Nares: I never listen to music -- ever. To be thinking about Emilio's journey and the children I see every day, it's going to push me through. It will be grueling and punishing, but when I think about what each child has to go through every day for two to three years, it makes it all worthwhile.

The forefront is always Emilio and the children who have to battle every day. I am fortunate enough to be out there to help, but it's always about the children -- they motivate me, and they are the heroes.

18,18,2018-05-11 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Most people, when they retire, get a gold watch. James Harrison deserves so much more than that.

Harrison, known as the ""Man With the Golden Arm,"" has donated blood nearly every week for 60 years. After all those donations, the 81-year-old Australian man ""retired"" Friday. The occasion marked the end of a monumental chapter.

According to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, he has helped saved the lives of more than 2.4 million Australian babies.

First, a note about antibodies

Harrison's blood has unique, disease-fighting antibodies that have been used to develop an injection called Anti-D, which helps fight against rhesus disease.

This disease is a condition where a pregnant woman's blood actually starts attacking her unborn baby's blood cells. In the worst cases, it can result in brain damage, or death, for the babies.

Here's why:

The condition develops when a pregnant woman has rhesus-negative blood (RhD negative) and the baby in her womb has rhesus-positive blood (RhD positive), inherited from its father.

If the mother has been sensitized to rhesus-positive blood, usually during a previous pregnancy with an rhesus-positive baby, she may produce antibodies that destroy the baby's ""foreign"" blood cells. That could be deadly for the baby.

How Harrison made a difference

Harrison's remarkable gift of giving started when he had major chest surgery when he was just 14, the Australian Red Cross Blood Service said.

Blood donations saved his life, so he pledged to become a blood donor.

A few years later, doctors discovered his blood contained the antibody which could be used to create Anti-D injections, so he switched over to making blood plasma donations to help as many people as possible.

Doctors aren't exactly sure why Harrison has this rare blood type, but they think it might be from the transfusions he received when he was 14, after his surgery. He's one of no more than 50 people in Australia known to have the antibodies, the blood service says.

""Every bag of blood is precious, but James' blood is particularly extraordinary. His blood is actually used to make a life-saving medication, given to moms whose blood is at risk of attacking their unborn babies. Every batch of Anti-D that has ever been made in Australia has come from James' blood."" Falkenmire said. ""And more than 17% of women in Australia are at risk, so James has helped save a lot of lives.""

Why his donations were a game changer

Anti-D, produced with Harrison's antibodies, prevents women with rhesus-negative blood from developing RhD antibodies during pregnancy. More than three million does of Anti-D have been issued to Australian mothers with negative blood types since 1967.

Even Harrison's own daughter was given the Anti-D vaccine.

""That resulted in my second grandson being born healthy,"" Harrison said. ""And that makes you feel good yourself that you saved a life there, and you saved many more and that's great.

The discovery of Harrison's antibodies was an absolute game changer, Australian officials said.

""In Australia, up until about 1967, there were literally thousands of babies dying each year, doctors didn't know why, and it was awful. Women were having numerous miscarriages and babies were being born with brain damage,"" Jemma Falkenmire, of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, told CNN in 2015 . ""Australia was one of the first countries to discover a blood donor with this antibody, so it was quite revolutionary at the time.""

Why he's a national hero

That would be more than two million lives, according to the blood service, and for that Harrison is considered a national hero in Australia. He's won numerous awards for his generosity, including the Medal of the Order of Australia, one of the country's most prestigious honors.

""It becomes quite humbling when they say, 'oh you've done this or you've done that or you're a hero,'"" Harrison said. ""It's something I can do. It's one of my talents, probably my only talent, is that I can be a blood donor.""

Now that Harrison has given his last blood donation (in Australia you can't donate blood past the age of 81), Falkenmire and others hope people with similar antibodies in their blood will step up and donate.

""All we can do is hope there will be people out there generous enough to do it, and selflessly in the way he's done,"" she said.",He donated blood every week for 60 years and saved the lives of 2.4 million babies,http://cnn.com/2018/05/11/health/james-harrison-blood-donor-retires-trnd/index.html
19,19,2018-05-23 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Congressional Republicans spend most of their time these days holding their breath and praying that President Donald Trump doesn't say something that will blow up their carefully laid plans for the 2018 election.

Of course, this is Donald Trump we are talking about. And blowing up carefully laid plans is, well, sort of his thing.

Which brings me to Trump's speech at the annual Susan B. Anthony dinner in Washington Tuesday night . Here's part of what Trump said when talking about the coming midterm election:

""But if Democrats gain power, they will try to reverse these incredible gains. These are historic gains. They will try and reverse many of them. So your vote in 2018 is every bit as important as your vote in 2016 -- although I'm not sure I really believe that, but you know. (Laughter.) I don't know who the hell wrote that line. I'm not sure. (Laughter and applause.) But it's still important.""

HA HA HA HA HA ... wait.

This is vintage Trump. He is reading a prepared speech about how 2018 is so critical because it will determine whether the gains made for conservatives with his 2016 election will be continued in the second half of his first term or not. It's standard issue political speak for a president trying to rally his somewhat too-satisfied base to the necessity of turning out to vote in midterm contests.

Since there have been midterm elections, presidents have given speeches in the run-up to the campaign trying make sure their bases understand just how high the stakes actually are for this non-presidential year vote.

JUST WATCHED These are the highlights of Trump's Twitter habit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH These are the highlights of Trump's Twitter habit 02:03

But this is Trump. And Trump never does things the way past presidents (or even past politicians) have. So he reads the line -- ""your vote in 2018 is every bit as important as your vote in 2016"" -- but them stops himself because, well, he doesn't totally believe it.

Trump believes that the most important election -- past, present or future -- was his election in 2016. It was the biggest upset in American political history. It was a seminal moment in the ongoing battle between the people and the powerful. It signaled a remaking of not just the Republican party but of how we conceive of -- and analyze -- American politics.

(Nota bene: I think he's right about all of that.)

In truth, that doesn't make Trump terribly unique. Every president thinks his election -- especially the first one -- is the most important election. And that the second most important election is their reelection race. The difference? They don't say it out loud.

Trump's honesty is sure to send a chill down the spines of Republican strategists tasked with trying to hold onto the GOP's 23-seat majority come this fall.

For Republicans to have any chance at remaining the majority party in 2019, they badly need the Trump base that turned out in droves to vote for the GOP nominee in 2016 to again head to the polls in five months' time.

The available data since that 2016 election suggests that isn't easy -- even with an engaged Trump. In Alabama, Trump was an active participant in the final days of the special election between Roy Moore and Doug Jones. But he was unable to sway the result to Moore. Ditto a special House election in southwestern Pennsylvania in which Trump campaigned with the Republican nominee, only to watch him come up short with voters.

What Republicans simply cannot have is a Trump who seems less than jazzed about the 2018 midterms -- and who conveys that ""meh"" feeling to his core base of supporters. Which is why Trump's comments on Tuesday night have to be so concerning for Republicans.

Let's be clear: There was a joke-y element to Trump's aside. People laughed -- twice! -- during his 2018-is-no-2016 lines.

But, in all ""jokes"" there is an element of truth. Especially when the joker is Donald Trump.

He often hides behind humor to tell truths he quite clearly believes. Or uses the idea that he was joking to escape criticism or controversy

The question Republican candidates and elected officials have to ask themselves this morning is, do they trust that Trump was joking? And, even more importantly: Does Trump's base know that he was joking? And will he make that clear a whole bunch of times between now and the November election? Can anyone make him?

Even the slightest loss of enthusiasm among Trump base voters could be problematic for the broader Republican Party. Special election results over the past 17 months have confirmed time and again what polls of the electorate also show: That the Democratic base is currently more passionate and motivated to turn out than the Republican one.

Trump's role over the next five months is to use his personal popularity among Republican base voters to close that gap. But comments like the one he made Tuesday night could well have the opposite effect.",Donald Trump just said something that will terrify congressional Republicans,http://cnn.com/2018/05/23/politics/donald-trump-2018-2016/index.html
20,20,2018-03-22 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Maybe there's no need for a fountain of youth after all. New research suggests that cutting calories by 15% for two years can slow the metabolic process that leads to aging and protect against age-related diseases.

After just one year on a reduced-calorie diet, study participants saw their metabolic rates drop significantly. The lowered rate continued into the second year and led to an overall decrease in oxidative stress, a process that has been tied to diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other age-related conditions.

""Reducing calorie intake provides health benefits to all people regardless of their current health status,"" said Leanne M. Redman, lead author of the study and an associate professor at Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University.

Animal studies have shown that restricting calories by 25% can extend life. The new CALERIE (Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy) study was designed by Redman, her colleagues and the National Institute on Aging to answer a simple question: Would the same be true in humans?

Aging biomarkers

During the first phase, teams of researchers ran small-scale pilot experiments to answer a variety of questions including, what kind of calorie restriction could study participants actually stick to? To this end, some of the pilot studies tested a diet-only calorie reduction, others tested exercise only, and still others tested half-diet, half-exercise.

Another question posed by the researchers: What level of calorie restrictions would have an impact on biomarkers of aging?

Aging biomarkers are simple biological measurements that differentiate longer-lived people -- those who celebrate birthdays into their 90s and 100s -- from people who live the average life expectancy, Redman said.

""We know that longer-lived individuals are able to sustain lower blood sugar levels and lower levels of insulin and have lower core body temperature levels in comparison to people who don't live as long as them,"" she said.

After the pilot studies, the National Institute on Aging committed to funding larger phase two CALERIE studies at three universities: Pennington in Baton Rouge, Washington University in St. Louis and Tufts University in Boston.

At Pennington, Redman and her colleagues focused on reducing calories by 25% through diet alone. Women between 25 and 45 and men between 25 and 50 were recruited; about half were normal weight and the other half overweight but not obese. Throughout the study, participants ate what they liked, yet they also took vitamins and supplements to ensure that their diets were ""nutritionally adequate,"" Redman said.

Each participant was also given a scale. Instead of calculating daily calories and slashing them by 25%, weight loss was used to estimate the total reduction in calories for each participant over time.

However, the participants did not hit the 25% reduction as anticipated, Redman said: ""People achieved 15% calorie restriction, actual, over the two years."" No matter. The results from this lesser calorie restriction amount were ""pretty remarkable,"" she said.

For example, participants lost an average of about 20 pounds each by the end of the first year and maintained that loss during the second year.

""The calorie-restrictive diet also caused a reduction in sleeping metabolic rate by about 10%,"" Redman said. This remained true after one year, when weight loss peaked, and after two years, when weight remained constant.

A slowed metabolism means the body has become more efficient in using fuel -- whether from food or oxygen -- to derive energy.

""It's important because every time we generate energy in the body, we generate byproducts,"" Redman said. These byproducts of normal metabolism, also called oxygen radicals, accumulate in the body and over time cause damage to cells and organs, she explained. And this damage is ""what has been linked to a shortened lifespan,"" she said.

Not only did calorie restriction slow the metabolism of participants, lower levels of oxidative damage were seen when measured by a compound in urine. Calorie restriction, then, mimicked some of the healthy aging signposts seen in long-lived individuals, Redman said.

'Breakthrough'

The ""big breakthrough"" with this study, said biologist John R. Speakman of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, is that it is the first randomized controlled trial of calorie restriction in humans.

Randomized, controlled trials, in which participants are divided by chance into groups to compare interventions, are considered more valuable to scientists than other types of experiments. Speakman, who did not participate in the research but he served on the data safety and monitoring board for the CALERIE project, explained that all previous studies of calorie restriction in humans have been on a voluntary basis.

""It has been known since the 1930s that calorie restriction reduces the rate of aging and extends lifespan in rodents,"" Speakman said. Since then, studies in different animals show the same general pattern -- with some exceptions. ""For example, it doesn't work in houseflies,"" he said. ""Plus, the monkey literature is a bit confusing.""

For this reason, the new study's ""big contribution"" is that participants showed two key changes previously observed in calorie-restricted rodents: lowered metabolic rate and reduced production of radical oxygen species, Speakman said.

That said, the level of calorie restriction achieved in the new study was ""rather modest compared to that used in rodents and other animals,"" he said. ""This really shows the difficulties in doing calorie restriction work on humans."" However, a strength of the new research is that it ""included extensive measurements of the individual responses.""

Exactly how calorie restriction prevents aging, Speakman said ""is the million-dollar question."" The research supports two theories of longer life: the ""rate of living"" (lower metabolism) and reduced oxidative damage.

However, the study shows a correlation only, he said, ""so we can't infer that these changes are causally linked to reduced aging. Nevertheless it is a step forwards to indicate that these two ideas are not rejected by the current research.""

Going forward, Redman wants to reconvene the study participants to see whether they're maintaining calorie restrictions and lowered metabolic rates. She also wants to study a group of people from early in their lives until death so she can see the possible long-term results of restricted calorie intake.

It's not only the diet, she repeated.

It's true that the people who see more sunrises than most of us eat less -- and more healthy -- calories than in a Western diet, Redman said. ""But what's important is they're living longer and they're free of chronic disease.""",Cut your calories by 15% to stay young,http://cnn.com/2018/03/22/health/calorie-restriction-longer-life-study/index.html
21,21,2018-06-22 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) It could happen at any time: Eventually, your kids may want their own social media accounts.

""If you have a teen or tween, you should expect them to come home around the beginning of the school year and say, 'Oh, I want to download so-'n'-so,' "" said Caroline Knorr, a San Francisco-based parenting expert with the nonprofit organization Common Sense Media

Yet at what age do most children launch their own social media presence?

In the United States, ""our understanding is that about half of kids have some form of social media by age 12,"" Knorr said, referencing a Common Sense Media census report released in 2016.

The Parent Curve offers a look at the norms and numbers around tough decisions parents face. Where are you on the curve?

The report was based on a nationally representative survey of 1,786 parents in the United States whose children are 8 to 18. The survey was conducted in July 2016.

The report found that, overall, 56% of the children had their own social media accounts, based on the parents' survey responses. Among those children, the parents reported that the average age when initially signing up for the account was 12.6 years.

Separated by age range, 80% of all teenagers (ages 13-18) in the group had their own social media account, compared with 23% of all tweens (ages 8-12), the parents' responses revealed.

Vivian Friedman, a child psychologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham , pointed out how children ages 6 to 12 develop the ability to think in concrete ways, and then during adolescence, between 12 and 18, they acquire the ability to think more abstractly

Since children think more concretely before adolescence, some may not be able to fully ""analyze the truth or validity of abstract issues"" related to social media, Friedman said.

So whenever parents allow their children to have social media, ""I think that the best way to do it is to sit down together and explore the program that your kid is interested in using -- and explore some of the privacy settings that they can use,"" Knorr said.

""Then it's important for parents and kids to talk about what is appropriate to put up and what is not appropriate,"" she said. ""I do think around 12 years old is when kids have that capability to follow your rules and to understand that those rules are really important and set in place to help protect their safety.""

A US law gives parents control over what information websites can collect from their kids.

For instance, a page on Facebook indicates that the social platform ""requires everyone to be at least 13 years old before they can create an account. ... Creating an account with false info is a violation of our terms.""

The page provides a link on how to delete an account if your underage child created one, and it provides a form to complete if you'd like to report an underage account.

""It's not technically against the law for kids to sign up for an app that is supposed to be for older than 13. Under COPPA, all that's needed is for parents to provide consent for companies to track the data attached to that account. Unfortunately, privacy policies come with so much gobbledygook, it's really hard for parents to understand what they're agreeing to,"" Knorr said.

""A lot of parents believe that the reason why the age is 13 is to help protect kids' safety, but really the reason why the age is 13 is because most social media shares data, and they actively mine data, and they're not allowed to do that for users under 13,"" she said.

In order to help protect your child's safety, ""the big thing is having a conversation with your child about social media use early and often and being aware of what they're doing, and having filters and using strict privacy settings while you're still monitoring their social media frequently,"" said Dr. Candice Dye, a pediatrician at Children's of Alabama and assistant professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Tell them, "" 'if you don't know somebody and they ask to be your friend, you don't accept that. If somebody's doing something on there that is offensive, then you unfriend them,' and then talk about general security things like 'passwords are private, and you don't need to write them down or share them with others,' "" Dye said.

""It's just about having those conversations with them and setting those boundaries and making room for the conversations to continue,"" she said. ""You want them to feel free discussing things with you as they come up.""

Though privacy and safety are important, Knorr views screen time itself as being among the biggest concerns when it comes to children signing up for social media.

""Many parents find that their most pressing concern about their kids getting social media is not really the safety and privacy but the 'time suck' aspect of it,"" she said. ""Of course, more time spent online does lead to more potential risk. So that's another really good reason to help kids try and limit how much time they're spending.""

For children and teens, 5 to 18 years old, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that they do not sleep with devices in their bedrooms, they avoid using devices for an hour before bedtime and they avoid using devices during family dinners.

The academy also recommends developing a family ""media use"" plan that includes consistent limits on how many hours of screen time are allowed per day while allowing for at least an hour of daily physical activity and an adequate eight or more hours of sleep.

The group warns that too much screen time can place your child or teen at risk of obesity, sleep problems, cyberbullying and negative performance at school, among other concerns.

22,22,2018-06-24 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) The Boston school superintendent, who announced he's resigning after a lawsuit accused Boston Public Schools of sharing information that led to a student's deportation, denied the allegation Monday, saying such an act would defy school system policy and his personal politics.

The lawsuit was filed Thursday by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice , the nonprofit group said in a news release, along with ""a coalition of students' rights groups.""

Superintendent Tommy Chang said in a Monday letter that Boston Public Schools had not received the lawsuit yet, but he was taking the unusual tack of speaking out because of ""how strongly we, as an organization, and I personally, as an educator and an immigrant, feel about protecting immigrant children.""

The groups are suing to obtain records to ""understand the extent to which BPS shares such student information"" with the Boston Regional Intelligence Center, known as BRIC, which the lawyer's group described as ""a network of local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies, which includes (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)."" The group said in a news release, ""BPS refuses to share any information.""

""The students' rights groups filed their initial public records request upon learning of an East Boston High School student who was deported based, in part, on the report of a run-of-the-mill school incident that was shared by Boston School Police with ICE via the BRIC,"" the lawyer's group news release states.

The ""school incident"" refers to two students who attempted to start a fight, but were unsuccessful.

Chang said in his Monday letter, ""That claim is false. BPS would never give student information to ICE, unless required under law.""

Boston Public Schools, he wrote, does not request or keep records on the immigration status of students, and even if authorities presented a warrant for student records, only the school's legal team could make the call on whether to comply.

During the incident in question, local and state police were investigating gang-related murders that occurred more than two years ago in East Boston, and BPS provided authorities with school police reports, he said.

""The information provided did not contain any reference to an individual immigration status,"" Chang wrote.

He did not explain the reason for his abrupt departure. Previously, neither Chang nor Mayor Martin Walsh gave a reason for his resignation.

And while Chang's resignation letter and the school district did not say when the resignation will become effective, CNN affiliate WCVB reported Chang will be leaving his post before the start of the new school year.

""Immigrants make this nation strong,"" he wrote in his Monday letter. ""Like so many people, I'm horrified by some of the actions our federal government is taking, particularly against immigrant families, actions that I believe are fundamentally contradictory to what this country stands for. I have long spoken out on the need to protect immigrant students, and will continue to do so.""

A native of Taiwan, Chang moved to the United States at 6 years old, the school district's website states. He said in his farewell letter Friday that public school teachers guided him on his educational journey, including learning English.

""In this moment more than ever, I want every immigrant child to know that's the country America strives to be, must be, and will be,"" Chang said.

Walsh said in a statement that he and Chang ""mutually agreed that there needs to be a change in leadership.""

""We need a long-term education leader with a proven record in management who can gain the confidence of the community on the strategic vision for the district and execute on the many initiatives that have been identified as priorities for our students and schools,"" the mayor's statement read.",Resigning Boston schools superintendent denies claims in deportation lawsuit,http://cnn.com/2018/06/24/us/boston-superintendent-resignation/index.html

24,24,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump was insistent on Monday he doesn't regret signing an executive order meant to keep migrant families together, even as the measure from last week continues to sow confusion and internal angst.

Meanwhile, his administration continued to maintain there was little they could do to appease the border crisis -- including carrying out Trump's own wishes to strip migrants of their due process rights.

The statements only furthered the notion of a White House at odds over how to end the humanitarian disaster while not appearing to soften a hardline immigration stance.

""The executive order was great,"" Trump declared in response to a question from CNN's Jeff Zeleny. ""It was something that I felt we had to do.""

Trump was speaking in the Oval Office ahead of a meeting with Jordan's king. His remarks came after a weekend of defiant tweeting, including Trump's suggestion that undocumented immigrants not be afforded due process in their deportation proceedings.

""When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no judges or court cases, bring them back from where they came,"" Trump tweeted on Sunday.

Seeking to explain that sentiment, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said during a briefing on Monday that most Americans agree that a drawn-out court proceeding isn't necessary for undocumented immigrants.

""Just because you don't see a judge doesn't mean you aren't receiving due process,"" she said, citing other ways of removing migrants from the country, including voluntary or expedited removal that don't require a judge.

Later, however, she conceded there was little the administration could do without Congress to alter the way migrants are tried in court.

""The President's laid out what he'd like to see. We're still waiting on Congress to give us the ability to do that,"" she said.

In private, Trump has questioned the executive order he signed last week, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. He's asked aides why he signed a document that seemed to create more problems then it solved, particularly in the immediate hours after he signed it. Federal agencies were unable to explain what the precise effect of the order would be and disagreements broke out internally about how the order should be carried out.

In reality, an executive order wasn't necessary to end the family separation crisis, which springs from the administration's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy. But after going back-and-forth on the matter, Trump insisted last week he be able to sign something to give the appearance of taking decisive action to end the humanitarian crisis. That set off a scramble among aides to prepare something for him to sign.

It was cast in headlines as a reversal after Trump and other members of the administration repeatedly insisted in public that only Congress could end the separations. Trump chafed at the suggestion he caved and fretted the decision made him look weak.

He denied those misgivings in the Oval Office on Monday.

""I was very, very happy that I signed that,"" he said, before linking the issue to his guest, whose country has welcomed hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war-torn Syria.

""It shows, you know, we're all talking about humanity, whether it's what you're doing in Jordan or what we're doing here,"" Trump said. ""The laws are obsolete, the laws are horrible.""

Last week, Trump initially lent his support for two Republican-backed immigration bills before tweeting at GOP lawmakers to quit wasting their time on such measures before November's midterm elections.

He didn't offer much clarity on that matter Monday, but claimed a solution was coming quickly.

""We want strong borders, and we want no crime,"" he said. ""That's what we want. And that's what we're going to get. We're going to get it sooner than people think.""",Trump says he doesn't regret signing immigration order,http://cnn.com/2018/06/25/politics/trump-immigration-order/index.html
25,25,2018-06-21 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Carol Costello is the host of ""Across America With Carol Costello"" on HLN. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.

(CNN) It was early afternoon on Thursday that I was defending Melania Trump on my HLN show, ""Across America."" You know, post- Peter Fonda tweet , pre-jacket.

Fonda, an actor, had rage-tweeted , ""We should rip Barron Trump from his mother's arms and put him in a cage with pedophiles and see if mother will will stand up against the giant a--hole she is married to.""

I was incensed. Melania Trump had persuaded her husband to end (sort of) the separation of families at the border. How dare Peter Fonda?

And then Melania Trump showed up in McAllen, Texas, in her signature safari-type shirt and white tennis shoes to visit the children ripped from their parents' arms.

Nomiki Konst, a guest on my show and a Bernie Sanders surrogate, speculated on the reason for Trump's trip, saying, ""Maybe she's there because Peter Fonda called attention to this?""

John Phillips, a conservative radio talker, rolled his eyes. ""I think we've kind of missed the point here. The one that got slurred in this tweet was Barron Trump.""

I was all-in with John in his all-out defense of Melania Trump until -- the jacket. Photographers caught our elegant first lady wearing a $39 jacket from the clothing store Zara. It is weird enough that she shopped at Zara -- this is a woman who toured Sicily with the G-7 spouses in a $51,500 Dolce and Gabbana jacket last year -- but it was way weirder to read the words on the back of that Zara fashion find: ""I really don't care. Do u?""

Melania Trump's spokeswoman insisted the jacket's message had nothing to do with the traumatized children detained in Texas. ""There was no hidden message.""

If that's true, then Donald Trump must be mistaken. He tweeted that his wife's jacket ""refers to the Fake News Media.""

Melania Trump's spokeswoman also urged the media not to ""focus on her wardrobe.""

Done and done, because instead of attention being paid to his wife's jacket, it should be on President Trump's actions.

Back in D.C., he was busy trying to get permission to extend the time immigrant children can remain detained with their parents beyond the current legal limit of 20 days.

President Trump's Department of Health and Human Services asked the Department of Defense to provide housing for 20,000 children. And Attorney General Jeff Sessions was busy giving interviews insisting ""we never really intended"" to separate families, even though Sessions ostensibly used family separations to deter people from crossing into the United States.

That said, I am still incensed at Peter Fonda's awful tweet. It was outrageous and wrong.

As for Melania Trump, she is proving to be the next best counterpuncher in the White House. Instead of admitting wearing such a jacket was a silly mistake, she doubled down, wearing the jacket again as she deplaned at Andrews Air Force Base.

The officers were dispatched to the Tuscany Place Apartments, near San Diego State University, after someone reported hearing cursing, objects being thrown and a man yelling at a woman in a violent manner, police chief David Nisleit said.

When the officers arrived, they knocked on the door but got no response. After smelling smoke coming from inside the apartment, the officers called the fire department to the scene, Nisleit said.

The officers then breached the door and were immediately met with gunfire, Nisleit said. Officers returned fire, said Nisleit, adding that ""many"" shots were fired in the standoff.

A 3-year veteran of the San Diego Police Department was shot multiple times and is in serious but stable condition. An 18-year veteran of the police force was also shot and is in stable condition. Both are expected to make full recoveries, Nisleit said.

27,27,2018-02-14 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Story highlights Feeling loved is often conveyed through small gestures, experts say

Cooking for others can be viewed as a nurturing act that comes with the benefit of increased happiness

(CNN) We say it before we end a phone call. We type it in our texts. It's the last words we speak before we say good night. ""I love you"" is possibly the most popular three-word phrase in the world, spoken millions of times every day.

""I love you"" translates intimacy between ourselves and others, but the expression is so common that it can lack the meaning it's intended. When saying and hearing it becomes automatic and expected, its power becomes dulled in our brain's limbic system, where we process love.

Psychologist Abraham Maslow created a ""hierarchy of needs"" that ranks what humans are motivated to achieve, with love cited as a basic need after safety, food and shelter. A human's need for love carries a weight within us that isn't always an emotion. It can be an overall warmth, a deep sense of belonging, an underlying connectedness or confirmation of adoration between people.

Still how do we arrive at a loving state?

Researchers from Penn State University found that feeling loved isn't just about saying or hearing ""I love you."" Feeling loved is often conveyed through small gestures. According to a recent study, behavioral expressions trump verbal ones when it comes to transmitting that loving feeling. ""It is possible for people to feel loved in simple, everyday scenarios,"" explained the study's lead researcher, Zita Oravecz. ""It doesn't have to be over-the-top gestures.""

28,28,2018-04-26 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Brooklyn, NY (CNN) As an emergency physician at Kings County Hospital Center, Dr. Rob Gore has faced many traumatic situations that he'd rather forget. But some moments stick with him.

""Probably the worst thing that I've ever had to do is tell a 15-year-old's mother that her son was killed,"" Gore said. ""If I can't keep somebody alive, I've failed.""

Gore, a Brooklyn native, finds violent injuries particularly hard to stomach -- a feeling compounded by the fact that many of the victims he treats are young men of color.

""When I became an ER doc, my patients looked just like me,"" he said. ""A lot of this stuff really hits home.""

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homicide is the No. 1 cause of death for black men ages 15 to 34.

""Conflict's not avoidable. But violent conflict is,"" Gore said. ""Seeing a lot of the traumas that take place at work, or in the neighborhood, you realize, 'I don't want this to happen anymore. What do we do about it?'""

For Gore, one answer is the Kings Against Violence Initiative -- known as KAVI -- which he started in 2009. Today, the nonprofit has anti-violence programs in the hospital, schools and broader community, serving more than 250 young people.

Victims of violence are more likely to be reinjured, so the first place Gore wanted to work was in the hospital, with an intervention program in which ""hospital responders"" assist victims of violence and their family -- a model pioneered at other hospitals. The idea is that reaching out right after someone has been injured reduces the likelihood of violent retaliation and provides a chance for the victim to address some of the circumstances that may have led to their injury.

Gore started this program at his hospital with a handful of volunteers from KAVI. Today, the effort is a partnership between KAVI and a few other nonprofits, with teams on call 24/7.

Yet Gore wanted to prevent people from being violently injured in the first place. So, in 2011, he and his group began working with a handful of at-risk students at a nearby high school. By the end of the year, more than 50 students were involved. Today, KAVI holds weekly workshops for male and female students in three schools, teaching mediation and conflict resolution. The group also provides free mental health counseling for students who need one-on-one support.

""Violence is everywhere they turn -- home, school, neighborhood, police,"" Gore said. ""You want to make sure they can learn how to process, deal with it and overcome it.""

While Gore still regularly attends workshops, most are now led by peer facilitators -- recent graduates and college students, some of whom are former KAVI members -- who serve as mentors to the students. School administrators say the program has been a success: lowering violence, raising grades and sending many graduates on to college.

""This is really about the community in which we live"" he said. ""This is my home. And I'm going to do whatever is possible to make sure people can actually thrive.""

CNN spoke to Gore about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: How did your background as a doctor influence your work?

Dr. Rob Gore: I just started asking myself, ""Why does this stuff happen?"" If we're just doing these Band-Aid approaches, then they're going to be suffering with the same problems. Your perspective completely changes if the trauma becomes personal. I started looking at violence as a public health problem -- this preventable disease where if we intervene, we could really change the scope of this. I want to preserve life and improve vitality, and that has really inspired the work that we've been doing with KAVI.

CNN: Why is the hospital responder program necessary, and how does it work?

Gore: When you have domestic violence patients, everyone knows what to do -- you call the sex abuse response team and start taking care of their physical and psychosocial needs. But when a 16-year-old male is shot in front of his building, often they'd just send him home. He's going back to the same building, school -- the same situation where he got into trouble and he's expected to carry on normal life. No one has paid any attention to that kid's needs.

Hospital responders are individuals from the same community who understand all the social, economic, even gang-related issues that might be impacting them. They are an advocate who makes sure that those patients are offered the same dignity as every other patient. They will follow up with the patients when they're on the hospital wards. They want to make sure that you have a safe place to go and a ride home. They identify the specific needs of that patient and work with the social workers, who have access to other resources. And they keep following up even after the patient has been discharged. We want to make sure that they don't come back for repeat injuries and that they can be in a position to take care of themselves and their families.

CNN: KAVI also has several community programs. What is their reach?

Gore: Our community programs cover a lot. Our tutoring program is run by medical students and emergency medicine resident physicians; it's a way to build a bridge between the hospital and the community. Our afterschool program for middle school students is called KAVI YO, which stands for Young Ones, named in honor of Willis Young, one of our hospital responders who was stabbed and died in 2015.

We also have a summer camp where our high school students work with middle school students. Our students have so much potential. They just need somebody to help figure out how they can access it. That's our ultimate goal -- we want to make sure the people we're serving are at their best.

29,29,2018-06-18 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Woodbridge, Virginia (CNN) Hundreds of FBI officials in dark suits bowed their heads in a Virginia chapel Friday as a pastor offered a prayer to God: ""Your son gave his life so that we may live.""

Before him and in the center of the vaulted space was the coffin of David LeValley, draped in an American flag. LeValley, the FBI's top agent in Atlanta, died in May of cancer brought on by his time as a first responder in the ruins of lower Manhattan after 9/11.

FBI agent David LeValley died from 9/11-related cancer in May, nearly 17 years after the attack.

LeValley later told friends he thought he was going to die that morning as the first of the twin towers came down in front of him. But the terror attack would not claim him as a victim until nearly 17 years later -- long after the months he spent pulling survivors and evidence from the rubble of ""the pile,"" after he raised three children and built a career as a thoughtful and selfless leader, his colleagues eulogized.

He was buried in a military ceremony at Quantico National Cemetery. He was 53.

Fifteen current and former FBI officials have died since 9/11 as a result of illnesses caused by the toxins they inhaled in their work at the attack sites.

Earlier in June, former FBI supervisory special agent Brian Crews, also 53, died of cancer, years after serving on an evidence response team at a landfill housing debris from Ground Zero. Crews was the third current or former agent in only the past few months to be recognized with this kind of line-of-duty death.

""They weren't thinking of the danger, they weren't thinking about their own safety, nor were they concerned for it at that time. They were concerned for the safety of others,"" FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich said Friday at the Virginia memorial service. ""We're only beginning to understand the long-term impact of that work on all our first responders.""

In addition to the 343 New York City firefighters that died in the initial collapse of the towers, another 176 men and women from FDNY have died from 9/11 health complications. The New York City Police Department counts 136 of its own who have died from illnesses related to the attacks.

In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, doctors saw irritant-related responses.

""Early on we picked up asthma, sinus (problems), heartburn from breathing and swallowing the stuff,"" said Dr. Michael Crane, director of the World Trade Center Health Program Clinical Center of Excellence at Mount Sinai.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's World Trade Center Health Program, sinus issues, reflux and asthma are the three most common 9/11-related health issues among first responders and survivors of the attack.

The program tracks and provides medical monitoring and treatment for emergency responders, workers, volunteers and survivors of the 9/11 attacks. Other 9/11 related illnesses include post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and chronic respiratory issues.

Nearly two decades since the attacks, doctors are now seeing a shift in the types of diseases they are diagnosing.

""The first wave was the acute -- the deaths and all the acute injuries in the first couple of days. The second wave was the aftermath and developed the sinus (issues), asthma, anxiety and depression,"" said Dr. Jacqueline Moline, director of the Queens World Trade Center Health Program at Northwell Health.

And now, she said, the illnesses have taken on a new dimension. ""The third wave is the diseases that take years to manifest. The transformation from acute to chronic to permanent disease. And that's where we really are now,"" she said.

As of April 30 of this year, over 43,000 people have at least one 9/11-related health issue. Over 80% of that group are first responders. In the past few years, the number of cancers has climbed.

""Cancer has a latency period. The earliest cancers are the blood cancers. And then you see solid tumors,"" said Moline. ""So the fact that we're seeing tumors on the uptick is not a surprise at all.""

In the beginning of 2015, there were 3,204 cancers in the World Trade Center Health Program's registry. By the end 2016, that number had almost doubled to 8,188 incidences . World Trade Center Health Program figures shared with CNN now count more than 9,300 cases of cancer as of April 30.

Studies have found that New York firefighters who responded to the 9/11 attacks were 10% more likely to develop cancer than the general population and that they are more likely to develop myeloma precursor disease, which can develop into cancer.

And while it's hard to tease out just how many of these cases of cancer are directly a result of the attacks, aside from other factors such as age and family history, there is no question that 9/11 hastened some of these incidences. Additional exposure led to ""more opportunities for the genetic formations,"" Moline said.

""We're hoping that might be a temporary trend, but it looks like it is continuing to increase,"" said Mount Sinai's Crane. In his clinic, he is now signing off on more than 20 cancer diagnoses related to 9/11 every week, he said.

""It's definitely concerning to see people pass in a very short period of time,"" said Thomas O'Connor, the president of the FBI Agents Association, a group that encompasses more than 80% of active duty agents.

O'Connor responded for months to process the scene at the Pentagon, where a hijacked plane crashed into the building on September 11, 2001, damaging a large area and killing 125 people inside.

""We were all wearing after the first day, or in part of the first day, masks -- paper masks,"" O'Connor said. ""Even with the personal protective equipment, it still didn't make a difference really.""

He's healthy now, but goes in each year for ""a whole myriad of testing"" through the CDC health program. Once a year, an envelope with the results arrives in the mail.

""It's like a bad lottery day -- you hope you don't win this one,"" he said. Some 14 agents are currently sick and enrolled in the program, O'Connor said.

At the FBI, O'Connor, along with his wife and a bureau friend, successfully petitioned then-FBI Director James Comey to formally recognize and memorialize agents who died from 9/11-related causes, he said.

Families of agents who died of 9/11-related causes now qualify for some line-of-duty death compensation, and can earn a spot on the venerable Wall of Honor. The agents association also runs a scholarship fund that has paid out millions in college costs to the children of fallen responders.

Today, the agents association is fighting to win more coverage from federal agencies for agents that are becoming sick. They are also working to remind the public about the work of the FBI and the sacrifice made 17 years ago.

""In this time of FBI bashing, I think it's important for people to know that the agents continue to do this type of work, they continue to die for the work they've done, and they're going to continue to do that,"" O'Connor said.","FBI official, dead of 9/11-related cancer, remembered as number of cases grows",http://cnn.com/2018/06/18/health/9-11-fbi-cancer/index.html

The United Nations health agency announced Monday in its 11th International Classification of Diseases (ICD) catalog that ""gender incongruence"" -- the organization's term for people whose gender identity is different from the gender they were assigned at birth -- has been moved out of the mental disorders chapter and into the organization's sexual health chapter.

The change will be presented at the World Health Assembly, the WHO's legislative body, in 2019 and will go into effect on January 1, 2022.

The WHO said the change is expected to improve social acceptance among transgender people, while still making important health resources available.

""It was taken out from the mental health disorders because we had a better understanding that this wasn't actually a mental health condition and leaving it there was causing stigma,"" said Dr. Lale Say, coordinator of WHO's Adolescents and at-Risk Populations team . ""So in order to reduce the stigma while also ensuring access to necessary health interventions, this was placed in a different chapter.""

31,31,2018-06-23 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Thousands of people marched Saturday through central London on the second anniversary of the Brexit referendum, demanding that the UK government give people a chance to make the final decision on whether it goes into effect next year.

The rally was organized by several pro-European Union campaign groups and dubbed the People's Vote march. Organizers say that if a Brexit deal is rejected by the Parliament, citizens should have a vote on any final terms of UK's exit out of the EU.

The initiative to leave the EU goes into effect March 29, 2019.

The rally started at noon at London's central Pall Mall street, and finished at Parliament Square. Neither the London Metropolitan Police nor Westminster Council -- the borough authority where the march took place -- would comment on the crowd's size. The BBC reported there were tens of thousands of protesters and a smaller pro-Brexit counterprotest.

The government remains knotted up on how to manage the economy, continue trading goods with the European Union -- its biggest export market -- and mollify businesses and investors who demand answers about future trade. The economy is now the slowest-growing in Europe.

In an interview with al-Quds newspaper, the White House senior adviser said although he has no reason not to believe Abbas when the leader says he is committed to peace, he criticized the Palestinian leader's ""talking points that haven't changed in the past 25 years.""

""President Abbas says that he is committed to peace and I have no reason not to believe him,"" Kushner said, according to a transcript of the interview. ""More importantly, President Trump committed to him early on that he would work to make a fair deal for the Palestinian people.

(CNN) If the thousands of migrant children who have been taken from their families are ever to be rejoined with their parents, then President Donald Trump must appoint a ""Family Reunification Czar"" immediately.

The US government has pulled children away from their parents and shipped these bewildered youngsters all over the country. It is unclear where all of these kids are right now. The parents often don't know. Although the media has recently been allowed to visit a few facilities , the government refuses to grant the media access to all of the locations where children are being held -- including the ""tender age"" facilities for infants taken from their mothers.

As it stands, many migrant parents have little reassurance that they will quickly find their kids. The mothers and fathers themselves are often poor and non-English speaking; those are two big barriers to navigating the complex bureaucracy in which they find themselves. Even lawyers are struggling to navigate the system well enough to figure out where their clients' kids are -- let alone reunite with them.

There is no high-level, overarching coordinator working to fix these problems -- or wring real changes out of the tangle of federal departments, agencies, local governments and private sector service providers that are involved.

There needs to be one person in charge of this effort to put these families back together. And that role cannot be symbolic. This official needs to have an office in the White House, a seasoned staff, interagency authority, a tough timeline and the ability to report directly to the President.

36,36,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Former Rep. Michael Grimm is looking to get his old job back representing Staten Island after spending a stint in federal prison for tax evasion. He's is running in Tuesday's Republican primary in New York's 11th Congressional District against current Rep. Dan Donovan.

Grimm may just win the primary.

The polling for the race is limited. A Siena College poll taken a little less than a month ago had Grimm ahead of Donovan by 10 points. The only other poll released this month was conducted by a group that is owned by a consulting firm that has worked for Donovan. That poll, which does not meet CNN's standards, had Donovan leading by single digits.

Either way, Grimm has a fighting chance.

The question how can a convicted felon be in a position to win, and what does the outcome of the race mean for the fall campaign?

1. Grimm was good at constituent services

When I visited with Grimm this week, I asked him what the number one thing a national audience might not understand about his popularity. He responded, ""how hard I worked and how effective I was as the congressman for four years ... I went about my constituent services in a very different way than I would say 95% of members of Congress. And that's personal touch. I show up personally when you have a problem.""

His supporters agreed with that. Veronica Petersen, whom I met at a Superstorm Sandy survivors event, told me, ""After Sandy and during Sandy, Michael Grimm was the man. I mean, he came in like ... Whoa. He helped us from day one. He was the one who got the flood insurance for us. It was 25% after Sandy. A lot of us couldn't afford that He went to Congress and got a bill that enacted it and brought it down to 18%. I mean, he does that for people.""

Indeed, Grimm's efforts to pass Sandy legislation was an instance in which he voted for his district's interests and against his own party. The $51 billion aid package passed the House with only 49 Republicans voting for it compared to 179 against it.

2. Even with Trump's endorsement, Donovan is seen as not pro-Trump enough

Like in any Republican primary in 2018, President Donald Trump is at the top of the agenda. Those who are seen as for him are largely in better shape than those who are seen as not supporting his agenda.

Donovan has Trump's endorsement, which could end up saving him in the end.

But Donovan's voting record has given Grimm an attack line. Only 25 House Republicans in this Congress have v oted with Trump less often . Donovan, for example, voted against the President's tax cut plan.

When I asked Grimm if there were issues on which he disagreed with the President, he couldn't ""see really any issues that I would disagree with."" Perhaps not surprisingly, 54% of likely primary voters said they thought that Grimm would work better with Trump in the Siena poll. Only 29% said they thought Donovan would work better with Trump.

It should be noted that when Grimm was in Congress, he wasn't a down-the-line Republican either. If you were to average his last two years in Congress, he voted with then-Democratic President Barack Obama 23% of the time. Only six Republicans out of 236 recorded by Congressional Quarterly voted with Obama more often during that span.

Being pro-Trump goes beyond just the numbers, however. Grimm has used the President as a type of blocker when it comes to the charges against him. Like the President and the Russian investigation, Grimm has said his conviction was part of a ""witch hunt"" by the Obama administration . He also said he won't release his taxes. Trump hasn't released his.

It's also about personality. Trump made a name for himself in the Republican primary by lobbing insults and being quick on his feet. Grimm fits that same mold. During a back-and-forth with Donovan during a recent debate, Grimm told Donovan, ""Oh, I've already predicted your future. In fact, I'm going to define it when you get beat on June 26.""

3. Grimm needs only hardcore supporters to win the primary

A victory by Grimm on Tuesday will say little about how the district at-large feels about him. Instead, it will be a sign that he had a group of hardcore supporters who were willing to turn out for a late June primary. To vote in a Republican primary in New York, you have to be a registered Republican. They only make up 27% of the voters in the district.

In 2016, only 33,022 votes were cast in the Republican primary for president. That, of course, was a marquee matchup. This is a congressional primary. The last time there was a competitive Republican primary for this seat was back in 2010. Back then, just 14,117 were cast in the primary.

Adding to the confusion is that New York is one of few states in the nation to have not one, but two state primaries. Traditionally, New York's primary has been in September, but a federal court ruling in 2012 mandated that federal primaries take place earlier than that so that servicemembers and those abroad had enough time to get their general election ballots and return them on-time. Primaries for state and local offices are still in September, while federal primaries are now in June.

The amount of attention this primary has received will likely boost turnout beyond the 2010 levels, though it's unclear by how much. It's probably only going to take between 10,000 and 15,000 votes to win on Tuesday. And given that Trump has an 82% favorable rating among Republicans in the district and by a 25 point margin voters think Grimm would work with Trump better, it's not hard to see how Grimm could get that number of votes.

4. A Grimm win is bad news for Republicans in the fall

Trump won the 11th district by 10 points in 2016, but Obama won it by 4 points in 2012. It's a district where Democrats can be competitive if a few things go their way.

A Grimm nomination would be something that would put Democrats in the ballgame. In talking with Grimm, he wanted to argue that he was the stronger general election candidate in the fall. The numbers don't agree.

In the Siena poll, only 55% of Donovan voters said they would support whoever won the Republican primary. Among Grimm voters, it was 81%. That is, Grimm voters were far more likely to back Donovan than the other way around. Even among Grimm's own voters, 22% agreed that Donovan was the stronger general election candidate.

That makes sense given that Grimm is a convicted felon. It also makes sense when looking at past election returns. Donovan won 62% of the vote in 2016 , when House Republicans only won by 1 point nationally. Grimm took 55% of the vote in 2014 , when House Republicans won by a significantly larger 6 points nationally.

Indeed, when you compare the presidential vote patterns to the results in 2014, Grimm's performance was among the weakest among Republican incumbents. His margin over his Democratic opponent was 7 points below what you expect given how all other Republican incumbents with Democratic opponents did. About 80% of Republican incumbents performed better given the lean of the district.

On the other hand, Donovan did about 6 points better than you'd expect given the lean of the district and how other Republican incumbents did in 2016. He outperformed about 85% of Republican incumbents given the presidential lean of the district.

Donovan winning the nomination would likely keep this seat in the Republican column. A Grimm victory on Tuesday would likely make this race a toss-up in the fall.",Why a felon could beat a US congressman in a primary on Tuesday,http://cnn.com/2018/06/25/politics/grimm-donovan-tuesday-ny-primary/index.html

But there's also fear in her dark brown eyes.

Kensi Hernandez stands with her mom, Ana, by their bed in a shelter in Tapachula, Mexico.

In her native Honduras, gangs threatened to kill her, she says.

For Kensi's mother, Ana Hernandez, the threat was the final straw. She grabbed some clothes, took her daughter and ran, she says.

They made it out of Honduras, walked and rode buses through Guatemala and then crossed the Suchiate River into Mexico, with plans to continue to the United States.

But for Kensi, there was more fear ahead.

A few days ago, her mom explained to her that they could be separated by US officials. She'd seen videos of what had been happening to families, including those who wanted to claim asylum.

Even hearing her mother talk about it now seems to scare Kensi. She hugs her mom, clinging to her.

It's just all so confusing, I don't know what to do. Ana Hernandez

And while President Trump has ordered an end to his administration's policy of separating children from their parents if they are caught crossing the border without permission, the fear remains.

For now, Kensi and Ana Hernandez say they plan to stay in Mexico rather than continue north, but they hope to eventually reach a friend in the state of Georgia.

""It's just all so confusing, I don't know what to do,"" said Hernandez, 34, who says she is four months pregnant.

They are staying in a shelter for migrants in the southern Mexican border town of Tapachula, sleeping together in one bed.

As other migrant children giggle and kick a soccer ball around, confusion reigns among the adults.

Marjory Flores, 24, cries as she describes how she is now alone with her three children after leaving everything and everyone else she has in Honduras.

She doesn't know if she will continue her journey to the United States, where she says she wants to work to give her children a chance to get an education and a better life. She heard the heartbreaking recordings of separated children crying out for their mami and papi and was saddened by them.

But she knows she cannot go back.

38,38,2018-03-12 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Not long ago, fat was the evil dietary villain. Before that it was salt. Now the sugar-free diet has exploded onto the health and wellness scene -- and seems to have topped many people's list of New Year's resolutions.

Sugar-free diets encourage people to avoid table sugar (sucrose), sweeteners such as honey and maple syrup, refined flours, condiments, soft drinks, sweets and some fruits such as bananas. Some also recommend eliminating or restricting dairy products.

The diet's advocates rightly note that excessive sugar consumption may lead to obesity and therefore increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.

And it's true we are swallowing too much of the sweet stuff, with the average American consuming around 20 teaspoons of added sugar a day.

But you don't need to quit sugar to lift your game on healthy eating. Quitting sugar is unlikely to improve your health any more than cutting down on ultra-processed foods, eating more vegetables, cooking food from scratch and limiting how much extra sugar you eat and drink.

At best, the sugar-free diet is confusing and imposes an arbitrary set of rules that aren't based on scientific evidence. At worst, such a restrictive diet can create food fear or an unhealthy relationship with food.

Diet mentality

The sugar-free diet is restrictive, with lists of ""allowed"" foods (such as whole grains, blueberries and grapefruits) and ""not allowed"" foods (such as white bread, bananas and raisins). This inadvertently promotes a diet mentality and causes followers to worry about accidentally eating something that's not allowed.

People who worry about food are more likely to diet. This may be because they are worried specifically about their weight, or about the impact certain nutrients have on their health.

Research shows dieting is not effective over the long term and can lead to greater weight gain over time. The brain interprets dieting and restriction as a famine , which causes the storage of fat for future shortages.

Dieting is stressful. In response to this, our body releases stress hormones such as cortisol , which may cause the body to store fat, particularly in the abdominal area.

Worrying about food can lead to stress , anxiety and depression, and is one of the defining features of the condition known as orthorexia

Orthorexia is the overwhelming preoccupation with eating healthily. People with orthorexia spend a lot of time thinking and worrying about food and eliminating foods that are deemed impure or unhealthy. Some experts suggest this behaviour is a precursor to, or a form of, an eating disorder.

Estimates suggest anywhere between 7% and 58% of the population may have the condition. There are no clear diagnostic criteria, which makes it difficult to measure its prevalence.

But we know 15% of women will experience an eating disorder at some stage in their life. So we need to ensure nutrition advice, however well-intentioned, doesn't promote or encourage disordered eating.

Cutting out the good stuff

Some sugar-free diets advise people to cut out or restrict healthy foods and food groups such as fruit and dairy, without evidence to support their exclusion. This perpetuates the food fear/dietary restriction cycle and may contribute to nutrient deficiencies.

These diets also recommend people avoid fruit for a period of time , and then re-introduce a limited list of expensive ""healthy"" fruits (such as berries) while avoiding the cheaper ""unhealthy"" fruits such as bananas.

Whole fruit is a wonderful source of fibre, essential vitamins and minerals, as well as antioxidants. Two serves of fruit per day can reduce the risk of developing some cancers, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Given American adults only consume half their daily requirements for fruit, the advice to restrict fruit further could result in people missing out on these benefits.

Many sugar-free followers also avoid plain dairy products such as milk, yoghurt and cheese, due to the assumption these contain sugars.

The sugar in plain dairy products is the natural lactose (a carbohydrate), which is nothing to fear. Unnecessarily avoiding dairy may increase the risk of osteoporosis if not replaced with adequate levels of calcium from other sources.

Sugar replacements

Strangely, many of the sugar-free recipes use expensive sugar alternatives -- such as rice malt syrup (due to its low fructose content), maple syrup (which is sometimes allowed and sometimes not) and dates -- to replace sugar.

However, these are still sugars and contain the same number of calories per gram as any other sugar. These alternatives offer no additional nutritional benefits other than rice malt syrup, which is a useful option only for those with a fructose malabsorption issue, and dates, which contain fibre.

People often eat more of the food containing these alternatives under the guise of it being sugar-free , which could lead to unintentional weight gain. One study found people ate about 35% more of a snack when it was perceived as healthy than when it was seen as unhealthy.

What to do instead

Eat plenty of plants, enjoy whole grains, beans and legumes. Fruit is your friend -- not your enemy.

Most people could probably eat a little less sugar, a little less often, but you don't have to quit it for good to be healthy.

40,40,2018-04-19 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Cochabamba, Bolivia (CNN) Brisa De Angulo grew up in Bolivia and remembers having a wonderful childhood. That is, until she was 15.

That's when she suffered repeated sexual abuse by an adult in her extended family.

His threats to hurt other family members silenced her. She fell into a deep depression, dropped out of school and developed an eating disorder. She made multiple suicide attempts.

When she finally gained the courage to tell her parents about the abuse, they reported it to the police and took the case to court. But they had trouble finding a lawyer willing to take the case. Members of her community worked to silence her. Her home was set on fire twice, and people tried to run her down with their cars.

""There was a lot of pressure for me to stay silent, but I just couldn't stay silent,"" said De Angulo, now 30. ""I found out that I wasn't alone, that there were tons of girls that were also being sexually abused, and I had to do something.""

Of the 12 countries that make up South America, Bolivia has the highest rates of sexual violence against women -- with seven in 10 women experiencing it in their lifetime.

In 2004, at 17 years old, De Angulo established Fundación Una Brisa de Esperanza -- or A Breeze of Hope Foundation . At its center in Cochabamba, Bolivia, the group provides free and comprehensive psychological, legal, medical and social services for child and adolescent survivors of sexual abuse.

""We work with the families...to see (the) child as a very powerful survivor, and to have the support that she needs so that she can take her case to court, and she can heal,"" De Angulo said.

The organization also advocates for legal reforms and policy changes for the rights of abuse survivors in Bolivia.

""I had to use the rest of my life to prevent other girls from going through what I went through,"" said De Angulo, whose extensive team has assisted about 1,500 young survivors.

CNN spoke with De Angulo about her work. Below is an edited version of the conversation.

CNN: Sexual violence has long been prevalent in Bolivia. What are the cultural stereotypes you're working to combat?

Brisa De Angulo: We see it a lot in Bolivia, that a woman is seen as having less value than men, and that starts even before the baby is born. If it's a boy, then you're in this culture of being more aggressive, the one who has control. If you're a girl, then you're this one who has to be submissive, not make problems and sit quietly. Even from a very young age, their path is already set.

We need to start changing that mentality so that they can be born in a context where they will be seen as equal. One of our most powerful ways of challenging the machismo culture is to work with pregnant women, to work with that family, to start challenging the stereotypical roles.

We also work a lot with prevention by giving workshops, training people -- people from government, police officers, judges, prosecutors, children in school.

CNN: Your experiences inspired you to pursue your law degree. What impact has your organization's legal efforts had?

De Angulo: When I went to the authorities, I was blamed for what happened to me, I was questioned for many hours. I was told that I was insensitive for wanting to put a man in jail, for wanting to destroy my family. I was one of the first adolescents in Bolivia to take my case to court, but the judges didn't want to take my case.

When we started the program, the conviction rate for sexual crimes was .02 percent. From the hundreds of cases that we've taken to court, we have a 95 percent conviction rate.

When I was taking my case to court, at the time, it was normal for an aggressor to question the victim on trial. It wasn't a lawyer, it wasn't the judge; it was the aggressor. Through our work, we've proved that that is a human rights violation and have changed the law.

Another law is that if the aggressor married the victim, you couldn't take the aggressor to court for rape. That was being used to marry a 13-year-old with a 40-year-old just to make sure that this man will never be taken to court for rape crimes. Thanks to all our work and our push to the government, we have been able to overturn this law.

CNN: The country now has an annual Walk Against Sexual Violence. How did that come about?

De Angulo: August 9 was one of the hardest days of my life because it was the day I had to go to court and face my aggressor. I started telling my story and asking people if they would join me on a walk against sexual violence and use a blue ribbon, meaning that you were against sexual violence.

(The first year) I thought there were only going to be about 20 people who would join me. But that day, thousands of people showed up with a blue ribbon. August 9 was later declared the National Day Against Sexual Violence in Bolivia. Now thousands of people all around the country, in the most remote communities, march on August 9.

41,41,2018-06-22 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Pride Month offers numerous events where members of the LGBT community can celebrate who they are.

But June also is a good time for straight people to show support for their LGBT friends, relatives and co-workers.

Here are 8 suggestions on how to be an ally.

1. Learn about the range of sexualities on the LGBT spectrum

Sexual identity in 2018 can be complicated and fluid, and new terms are entering the vocabulary. It's normal to be confused. Here's a closer look at some terms to help you understand them better.

2. Make a small gesture or two

Little things, such as accompanying a loved one to their first Pride parade or hanging up a rainbow flag, carry more weight than you may realize. Actions speak louder than words.

3. Use appropriate pronouns

Participants ride in a ""Love is Love"" float during Berlin's annual Christopher Street Day gay pride parade in July 2017.

But words still matter. Coming out as LGBT can be a long, hard journey. You can show respect and sensitivity to your friends by asking how they identify and then using those identifiers.

4. If someone comes out to you, it's not your place to share their story

Those on the LGBT spectrum may well have been persecuted by strangers, governments and even loved ones. It took courage for them to come out. Don't assume because they confided in you that they want you to share it with other people. It's their story to tell.

A protester waves a rainbow flag during a rally staged by the LGBT community in Istanbul in 2016.

5. Listen

Try to be understanding, even if it's sometimes hard to relate. Members of the LGBT community face struggles that straight people may not have experienced. Show some empathy.

6. Speak up against prejudice

If you hear someone make an anti-gay joke or a crude comment, let them know you don't appreciate it. Don't support businesses with discriminatory policies or politicians who voice intolerance.

LGBT supporters march on June 25, 2017 in Istanbul, Turkey. That year's Pride March was banned by Istanbul authorities, but some organizers defied the order.

7. Don't make Pride all about you

Don't stare or sneak pictures of LGBT people like they're exotic creatures. Don't try to guess aloud how someone identifies or babble on about what a great ally you are (let your actions speak for themselves). Observe, listen and take part -- but know that as an outsider, you have certain boundaries.

Revelers at a Pride parade hold up a giant rainbow flag in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on June 3, 2018.

8. And please, PLEASE do not ask why there's no Straight Pride month

This should be self-explanatory. As your mom probably told you, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it.","How to be an ally to your LGBT friends, relatives and co-workers",http://cnn.com/2018/06/22/health/lgbt-how-to-be-an-ally-trnd/index.html
42,42,2018-06-20 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) Halima Aden has come a long way from running around barefoot in a refugee camp in Kenya, to become the first hijabi woman to feature on the cover of British's Vogue.

She is now gracing global runway shows, inhabiting a world of glamor, far removed from her humble beginnings in Kenya's vast Kakuma camp.

""We knew nothing about fashion, all we cared about was playing around barefoot,"" says the 20-year-old, explaining how she would run with friends around the dusty camp in northwest Kenya, run by the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR.

Aden was born in Kakuma where she grew up alongside nearly 200,000 refugees until she was seven years old.

Her only dream then was to work with the United Nations overseeing the welfare of refugees in the camp.

The model recalls her early days at the camp which first opened its doors in 1991 to host refugees from Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia.

""It was good and fun,"" she says of her childhood memories. ""We mixed with different people from diverse religions and communities and that made our childhood fun.""

Home for the displaced

When war broke out in Somalia in 1992, her family's house was set ablaze, forcing them to flee to neighboring Kenya.

The family settled in the refugee camp located in Kenya's remote Turkana region

Kakuma was set up to serve mostly south Sudanese refugees but is now home to thousands displaced by wars across Africa.

They mostly come from Somalia, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Uganda and Rwanda, according to the UNHCR.

Previously Kenya announced the closure of refugee camps but backed down in the face of international pressure.

Most of the refugees living there depend on food and aid from humanitarian organizations till they are resettled, a process that is often slow.

In 2004, Aden's family was among those resettled to St. Louis in the United States after a decade-long vetting process.

Until Aden's family made their way to St. Cloud Minnesota, also known as ""little Mogadishu,"" she says she had difficulty adjusting to the new life in the US and longed for her home in Kakuma.

""In the US there were cliques, but back home children played together in groups, we had come together and blended our beliefs to form our own unique multi-environment. We got along really well,"" Aden says.

However, her life changed when, in 2016, she participated in the Miss Minnesota USA pageant

During the two-day beauty pageant, Aden showed only her face, making her the first contestant to wear a hijab and a burkini in the pageant.

According to Aden, taking part in the pageant was an opportunity to dispel the narrative that Muslim women are oppressed.

She says she was bullied for wearing her hijab growing up and wanted to show people that she was proud of her religion and culture.

""There are so many Muslim women that feel like they don't fit society's standard of beauty,"" she told CNN.

""I just wanted to tell them it's OK to be different, being different is beautiful, too.""

'A place of hope'

Earlier this month, Aden made a return to Kakuma for the first time since she left.

Aden immediately shrugs off any sense of victimhood at growing up in a refugee camp. Instead, she says the trip brings back happy memories.

""This was my first home, a place of safety for many families who come here to seek peace but it's also sad that it is still a refugee camp,"" she says wistfully.

""While there were many struggles that came with living in a refugee camp, I think many are surprised to know that I would characterize my childhood as good. Kakuma is definitely a place of hope. The camp inspired me to work hard in life,"" Aden told CNN.

Kakuma's aerial view paints a picture of an organized and neatly designed city, but like most refugee camps, it's a mirage.

Aden says not much has changed since she left 13 years ago.

""It broke my heart to see how little has changed within the classrooms since I was in the camp. Refugee children deserve the same opportunities to flourish and be successful in school.""

Aden plans to use her new-found fame to impact the lives of those left behind in the camp and has formed a partnership with United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

She not only wants to see better living standards for refugees but also, ""to be included in the conversation when we talk about making the camp life better for refugees.

""They know better than anyone what changes need to be made, what has been effective, and where efforts are most needed.""",Halima Aden: Vogue hijabi cover star on growing up in a refugee camp,http://cnn.com/2018/06/20/africa/halima-aden-world-refugee-day-intl/index.html
43,43,2018-06-16 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) What do you think when you think ""Alabama""? Extremely conservative politics? That's true. One of President Trump's biggest crowds during the campaign was in Mobile. And Attorney General Jeff Sessions is from Alabama.

Do you think a history of racism? Well, that's true, too. As I said, President Trump had one of his biggest crowds in Mobile, and again, Attorney General Jeff Sessions (whom the US Senate once denied a judgeship over accusations of racism -- among other things, he joked a little too much about the Ku Klux Klan -- and who recently used the Bible as an excuse for his separating Latino parents from their children when they are seeking asylum) is from Alabama.

But one thing I'm guessing that you don't think when you think ""Alabama"" is ""W. Kamau Bell."" Alabama is my home -- sort of.

Let me explain.

Everybody comes from somewhere. For most people, like my wife, it is fairly simple. She was born and raised in one area of the country. It makes going ""home"" easy for her. Apparently most people in the world live their entire lives in one small area of the world. Not me.

I was born in Palo Alto, California; quickly moved to Indianapolis; after a few years me and my mom moved to Boston; then Chicago; then Mobile with my dad; then back to Chicago with my mom; then Philadelphia for college; then back to Chicago; and then to the Bay Area where I've been since (minus a two-year ""sabbatical"" in New York).

When I was a kid my mom used to say that I could run for president someday, because I knew so many parts of the country. Apparently I was really just getting ready for my current job as a touring comedian and host of ""United Shades of America."" And even though the city of Mobile appears on the above list of places that I have lived only once, it is the one place on my list that has been a part of my life consistently since I was born -- even before I was born.

In a special episode of ""United Shades of America,"" which you can now watch on demand , I go home to Mobile. Mobile is my home because in addition to spending so much time there, Alabama -- specifically, Monroe County -- is where much of my dad's branch of the family tree came from.

My dad was born in a simple shack -- now a hunting cabin -- in Vredenburgh, Alabama, a town so small it is unincorporated. But my dad's parents moved my father and his older siblings to Mobile in the 1940s. At the time, it was a boomtown. Located off the Gulf of Mexico, it was a major port, and it had plenty of jobs -- even for black people.

Most people I run into have not heard of Mobile. Even though it is the third-largest city in Alabama, in the north and out west, we tend to think of Alabama as one amorphous thing. All of the Southern states are thought of as just subsets of this region we collectively call ""The South."" But recent political changes in Alabama (the election of Democrat Sen. Doug Jones and progressive Mayor Randall Woodfin) prove that if the South does rise again, it may be a different South.

This episode is maybe the most personal episode of ""United Shades of America"" that I've ever done. My dad is featured throughout the episode. My cousin, the award-winning fantasy author N. K. Jemisin, who I grew up with, is in it, too. Me and N. K. talk about growing up and the hours we spent in my grandma's house talking about all the amazing things we were going to be when we grew up.

I think we have both surprised ourselves with how right on our imaginations were. And while my grandma is not in the episode -- she passed away when I was in my early 20s -- she still makes her presence felt, which would come as no surprise if you knew her. Her presence was as big as one of Mobile's Mardi Gras floats.

I went by her old house, which I hadn't been to since just after she died. No one lives there now, and no one will anytime soon. It is abandoned. I stood outside and talked about her for a few moments. I was so wrecked by emotions that I still can't watch that scene in the episode without tearing up.

JUST WATCHED This black woman is proud of Confederate flag Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH This black woman is proud of Confederate flag 01:19

And for the sake of not sugarcoating everything about the South, I met up with Bree Newsome in South Carolina to talk Confederate flags. Bree is a real-life superhero who took it upon herself to remove a Confederate flag from government property in South Carolina. And to be fair and balanced, I also talk to a defender of the Confederate flag. Arlene Barnum, a black woman. Yup, you read that right.

It was very important to me to open up in this episode, because Mobile is very important to me. My family regularly vacations there. I took my oldest daughter to Mardi Gras -- the first Mardi Gras parades in America happened in Mobile -- just like my grandma had taken me to Mardi Gras when I was my daughter's age.

And as much as I know people think of me as a typical Bay Area snowflake, bleeding heart liberal, sushi eater (which I am), I am also in large part a down-home, Baptist-church-going, ""y'all""-saying Southern man who calls every adult male he doesn't know ''sir,"" and who wants everything that comes out of the sea to be deep-fried.

For my parents, it was a chance for them to learn some surprising things about our family. Two very big long-term myths were disproved. To learn what they were, you should watch the three short episodes. How's that for a tease?

I am really grateful for the opportunity to do this work. And even more grateful that CNN decided to air this one on Father's Day, so I don't have to get my dad anything else (he's impossible to shop for anyway).

But it also feels right to air such a personal episode so shortly after the passing of Anthony Bourdain. If Tony taught me anything -- and whether he knew it or not, he taught me a lot -- it was to put yourself into the work you do. I couldn't talk about Alabama without putting a lot of myself (and my dad) in it. So to honor that lesson, this episode is dedicated to Anthony Bourdain.","W.

We may think we know a lot about Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman, one year after he was elevated to Crown Prince. After all, the past 12 months have seen him blitz world capitals, wooing politicians, business leaders and populations alike promoting his vision for modernizing his country.

In London alone, he lavished a cool $1 million on advertising during a three-day trip, according to a source with knowledge of the visit. The US got a two-week version of the same charm offensive.

But much remains unknown about the Crown Prince, who has staked his leadership and potentially his country's stability on bringing power to his family. Failure could be dangerous for us all.

Front and center right now is the war in Yemen. He owns it, and the key battle that could turn the tide of the conflict in Saudi Arabia's favor is raging in the port city of Hodeidah.

Not long after his father took the throne in January 2015, MBS, as he is known, initiated the desert kingdom's fightback against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who had routed Yemen's elected government just over Saudi Arabia's long, porous southern border.

MBS was (and still is) defense minister, so any Saudi blood lost would be on his hands. He would be measured by the course and outcome of the war.

Soon after he green-lighted the confrontation, a border guard was killed in Najran, the first member of the Saudi forces to die in the conflict.

I raced up there from a nearby town and met the guard's family. MBS arrived soon after. Winning the war was important for him, but so was keeping Saudis on side with his grander plans.

Over the intervening years the conflict has escalated, several thousand Yemenis have been killed, a third of the country's population is short of food, and Houthi-fired, Iranian-made missiles frequently scud over hundreds of kilometers of desert to be shot down near the Saudi capital.

The lives of Riyadh's more than 7 million people are in MBS's hands, but the region as a whole is at risk: A mass-casualty event in the capital could push the young Crown Prince into open conflict with Iran.

But the war in Yemen is only one of the tensions facing MBS.

Saudi's image is so sullied by Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attackers, 15 of whom were Saudi, and decades of laws limiting basic freedoms -- most notably those that affect women -- that his message has struggled to find wide traction, no matter how intensive his charm offensive has been.

Yet he needs the outside investment and faith in his abilities to realize his so-called Vision 2030, a gargantuan dream of a supercharged Saudi future, propelled out of its fossil-fuel dependence and into a diversified global marketplace employing the country's burgeoning youth population.

Locking up hundreds of Saudi's business elite, along with a fair few of his own relatives, including other Saudi princes -- albeit in a fancy hotel -- several months ago and accusing them of corruption didn't do him any favors when he hit the boardrooms. And the stories that stuck in people's minds were the ones his public relations teams couldn't suppress.

One of them is his reputation as a big spender. The PR gurus couldn't squelch the talk of his supersized yacht, or rumors that he owns the world's largest chateau and near-priceless pieces of artwork, or explain away his sudden billion-dollar spat with tiny neighbor Qatar.

In his shoes, the criticism of his free spending undoubtedly feels unfair.

He is allowing women to drive and letting them go to sports stadiums, allowing music to be played on streets, permitting outdoor performances and, perhaps very significantly, marginalizing the kingdom's religious police. And Saudis are no longer forced to go to prayer five times a day.

Critics say the changes are merely cosmetic, and note that the government has arrested a number of women in recent weeks who have demanded further reforms.

But the atmosphere does seem more relaxed now than there was a year ago. As a friend there said recently as we were out walking the streets, he is no longer made to feel guilty, like he is being a ""bad"" Muslim.

He -- as was the case with almost everyone else I've talked with there since MBS became King in waiting -- wants the 32-year-old to succeed.

A few months ago, there were rumors of an attack on MBS' palace that turned out later to be palace guards shooting down a rich kid's drone.

In the hours spent waiting for the facts to emerge, my friend told me, his biggest fear was that MBS was the target of a coup aimed at stopping his reforms. ""He has to succeed,"" my friend told me. ""We can't go back.""

More than any other Saudi before him -- with the exception of the nation's founding father, King Abdul Aziz Al Saud, also known as Ibn Saud -- MBS may be the most fearless leader the country will get.

He has shaken up the sclerotic body politic of Saudi government, and after several reshuffles, has invigorated and energized it.

Ministers and royals I've talked to describe MBS as a workaholic, consuming spreadsheets late in the night, calling ministers to his office and to account way after their bedtime.

His speed is obvious, the reasoning less so. The quicker he goes, the bigger the chance of a misstep.

For every minister forced from office, for every disenfranchised conservative cleric, for every rich royal hauled in for corruption and fleeced of allegedly ill-gotten billions, for every businessman shaken down, more potential enemies are created.

The risks of a fall are as apparent to MBS as they are to the rest of the kingdom and the region.

Failure on any significant front could trigger turmoil, from an ugly internal power struggle to an unintended showdown with Iran, either of which in a worst-case scenario could lead to surge in global gas prices.

In such circumstances, Saudi Arabia would go from being a potential force for long-term stability to a cause of regional -- and even global -- liability.

For now, MBS is keeping his footing, and the country's tribes -- through whom his power traditionally flows -- are either being bypassed or cutting him enough slack to pull his vision off.",Mohammed bin Salman is on a make or break mission,http://cnn.com/2018/06/21/opinions/mohammed-bin-salman-first-year-intl/index.html

Admitted with lung fibrosis and pneumonia, he had scars and infection aggressively replacing his airways, despite our best treatments.

As a newly minted doctor years ago, my mind was usually occupied with beeps and buzzers providing me technical information to help calculate choices about patients' care. Having developed gray hair over many years at the bedside, my first priority is now more straightforward: to hear the voices of the vulnerable people looking up at me from their bed. That is what I try to do as a physician, including, of course, what they tell me in the silences.

I pulled a chair next to his bed so we could talk at eye level. His face was blank. ""I want euthanasia. I'm going to die soon, so what's the point of living longer? I'm just wasted space.""

I felt nauseated. The illegality of euthanasia was not what ran through my mind. Instead I thought about how Paul had lost his sense of personhood. I thought about how I had chosen to become a doctor in the first place.

I chose medicine as my calling after a childhood spent in the Deep South: Shreveport, Louisiana. My mother taught English there after my father, an engineer, had left her for another woman. I remember it was so hot that my siblings and I would fry eggs on the sidewalk. No joke. On most days, we'd walk to a nearby bayou and catch baby alligators for fun and fill up coolers with crawfish for dinner. That last part is important because we had no money at all. Dad wouldn't pay anything to Mom, who didn't make much as a teacher. So I started working at the farm of a man who wanted to marry my mother. I worked 14-hour days from about five in the morning doing square bales of hay until seven at night picking vegetables and running the country store.

While I cherish those years and the formation that grueling work provided, I was determined to do something different with my life. Mom told me that Dad had loved math and science, and she taught literature. So I figured it must come naturally for me to split the difference and do something with people, science and the arts. To me, that meant medicine.

Dr. Wes Ely assessing a patient in the Medical Intensive Care Unit at Vanderbilt.

I remember our first big assignment in sixth grade was to write a research paper on what we would be when we grew up. I rode my beat-up bicycle to the local library and began reading about how to become a physician: What was the process and what would it all mean? I walked out of the library that day having spent most of my time reading a long medical essay about truth. The author insisted that to be a physician, one has constantly to seek truth about the patient's diagnosis, the best treatment, and the best way to serve each and every person. What I learned from the essay was that truth doesn't change depending on our ability to stomach it. As I progressed through Jesuit high school and Tulane, this became a common theme in my pursuit of a life as a doctor: ""Wrong is wrong even if everybody is wrong. Right is right even if nobody is right."" Numerous people are credited with some version of this quote, from actors to philosophers to theologians. That sense of truth drove my study and training and my realization that each person's life has value beyond measure.

I knew long before I met Paul that I couldn't kill another person just because he or she wanted me to, but I still had to find a way to respond to Paul's request to die.

'Just don't abandon me'

My response came in parts over my days with him. First, I explained that, as his physician, I wanted to be with him through the dying process. I told him that I considered us to be in a mutual covenant. We both had a degree of autonomy that had to be respected, but I would never intentionally harm him. ""Paul, our covenant includes my limiting your suffering,"" I said. ""You are the best judge of when you need more meds for pain, anxiety and breathing. All of us will work day and night to end your distress, but we won't deliberately end your life.""

With our eyes locked, Paul gave his instruction: ""Just don't abandon me."" And we sat there, as partners.

As a physician, there is no better place to be. Perhaps especially amid the uncertainty, we must learn to partner with each person in the bonds of this two-way relationship. He in need of help and me in need of helping.

Paul was receiving excellent palliative care for his physical symptoms, but it wasn't enough. It never is. Emotional isolation and despair can cast a shadow darker than disease. Physicians fail our patients on a human level. We forget that our patients are more than the sum of their medical conditions, so I asked Paul about other types of therapy — art, music, spirituality, pets, sunshine — that might help him.

'He who has a ""why"" to live can bear almost any ""how""'

""I want my music. Can you get me the soundtrack for 'Lord of the Rings'?"" Within minutes we had the songs playing in his room, and his demeanor changed from desolate to alert and engaged. ""I love music. It's always been a motivator, but now ... I don't know."" He shifted in his bed. ""My goals are gone.""

Nietzsche's words came to my mind, ""He who has a 'why' to live can bear almost any 'how.'""

Viktor Frankl , as a physician-survivor of Auschwitz, used Nietzsche's quote four times in his crucial analysis, ""Man's Search for Meaning."" I think this book should be required reading for medical students.

As with many patients, Paul's story needed unpacking. ""Paul, what did you do in life?""

He smiled and shrugged. ""I'm a rare beast: a plumber who acts. I do Shakespeare festivals. You know, 'The quality of mercy is not strained.' I've been mulling over that line. Years ago I didn't understand it. I do now. Mercy should not be forced. It's better as a natural infusion, one person to another.""

I described for Paul the many years I spent alongside my single-mom-turned-Shakespeare-director, helping her cue actors. As we talked, I watched his erratic oxygen levels fall and then partially recover, obliging us to take breaks. Sweat would build up on his forehead, and, more than once, I worried that our conversation was too much of a strain. But we were unpacking, and it was essential.

The quality of mercy

That night I asked Christine, a nurse who loves theater, to sit and talk with Paul. Soon their lives were interwoven, too.

""I think I helped Christine,"" Paul said the next day. ""My own illness made me forget that one of my 'things' is seeing when someone is hurting. And Christine is. She came to help me, but it turns out some really personal things in our background are weirdly similar. I told her my way through the worst of it."" He paused, his thoughts far away.

It seemed like a good time to return to his previous request. ""Paul, you've asked for euthanasia, and you brought up Portia's line from 'Merchant of Venice' about mercy. Can we talk about these things?"" He nodded, and closed his eyes.

""We all want to be here with you in your suffering. I want your opinion: I don't think injecting you with a lethal drug would be truly merciful, but it would, in every sense of the word, be 'strained.' It would be a forced and unnatural 'false' mercy. Whenever possible, mercy must also be lifting and healing. I don't want to abandon those key elements in serving you.""

His eyes opened wide. ""Doc, talking with you and Christine about life's best and worst times has helped."" He took a deep breath, and I heard the whoosh of high-flow oxygen into his nostrils. ""Things I confided to Christine are helping her sort through her own struggles. She said she's coming back tonight, and that means the world to me."" Then, unwittingly, Paul paraphrased Nietzsche: ""When we met, I was afraid of being a burden and not mattering. Now I feel different. I'm not a believer like others, but I guess I remembered the 'why' to live.""

Short of a war zone, there are few settings as raw as an ICU. Yet treasured moments of human transformation come when people like Paul rediscover their ""why,"" even if just for an hour or a day.

'I'm glad I didn't miss this time'

I see many paths toward survival in the ICU, and for non-survivors, myriad paths toward death: sudden, prolonged, stuttering, reluctant, stoical -- and these paths are dynamic, not static.

It is a rare patient who asks me for euthanasia, but it is nearly universal that dying patients seek help with suffering. Sitting on their beds brings me right up against their fears, the greatest of which is usually not intolerable pain.

Lack of control is what bothers people the most, and it drives most requests for euthanasia, which is predominantly a first-world phenomenon. As we have gained more and more ability to dictate so many aspects of our lives, looking ahead in uncertainty has become something people are not willing to tolerate. As a physician, I find this is a very important ""teachable moment"" for most patients: helping them (and me) to live in the moment. Whitewashed along a wall in the home for destitute and dying in Kolkata, these words of Saint Mother Teresa became emblazoned in my mind, and I recalled them for Paul: ""Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin."" He nodded in agreement.

Paul reminded me that the best remedy for angst is human relationship and community.

The problem with assisted suicide and euthanasia for Paul — and for others — is that it presented him with an illusion of 'cure,' when in reality it would have left him devoid of the healing he received.

And alongside the patient, of course, sits the physician. The problem for me with intentionally administering lethal medications to end the life of another person is that it would rob me as a healer. I would be qualitatively changed. If I were ever to assume that I had authority over life to take it deliberately, it would, for me, create an irrevocable cavern of emptiness. The infinite worth of every person outprices autonomy: What you and I want is less important than who we are.

Obviously, the approach I took with Paul won't be an answer for everyone, yet it is too often left untried. Some will say Paul's story is merely an uplifting anecdote. Nevertheless, I hope to embrace the lessons I learned at his bedside for most of my patients, and I hope my colleagues do the same.

We are sent to heal even when cure is not possible. What we should be trying to heal is often not physical disease or clinical depression, but a person's sense of insignificance and hopelessness, which we cannot heal by eliminating the person.

Paul died a week later. By then he realized his life was of value even with a terminal disease. In fact, the last thing he said to me, between gasps, was: ""I'm glad I didn't miss this time. I never saw it coming, Doc. ... In losing my breath, I gained it.""

(CNN) Depending on whose Twitter feed you look at, XXXTentacion's death was either a tragedy or cause for celebration.

That side of the street mourns the loss of Jahseh Onfroy (XXX's real name): his music, his work's influence, his life

The other side, though, seems to be gratified he's gone, that the other side of his legacy -- violence, homophobia and domestic brutality -- has died with him. There are tweets that call out those who choose to focus on his music rather than his victims, tweets that say he deserved to die for the acts he committed, tweets that label him a homophobe and abuser while cutting his music down to ""a few catchy beats"" -- and I agree with many of them.

But I will not be answering the battle cry on social media to condemn his life or celebrate his death, not even as a survivor of domestic violence or someone his homophobia might have prompted him to target.

Jahseh Onfroy (XXXTentacion's real name) reportedly grew up in a violent and neglectful home. He was expelled from middle school for fighting and kicked out of high school chorus for punching someone before dropping out his sophomore year.

Shortly after, he spent time in a juvenile detention center for possession of a gun. During his time there, as he later admitted in the No Jumper podcast , he was assigned a gay roommate, someone he labeled ""a risk"" �� to what? His masculinity? His straightness? I'm not sure, but I do know that when Onfroy says that after he saw the guy looking at him while he was changing after a shower, Onfroy beat him, ""tried to strangle him,"" and admitted he was trying to kill him ""because of what he did.""

As a pansexual person (meaning someone who is attracted to people regardless of gender or biological sex), I view this incident -- which according to my reading of Florida law could and should have been prosecuted as a felony hate crime -- as the stuff of my nightmares, especially since the Onfroy told the Miami New Times , ""Would I change anything about my journey?... no.""

His lack of remorse shocks and terrifies me, as does the status of hate crime reportage. According to FBI statistics for 2016, there were 1,255 victims of hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation, and 787 of those were against gay men. However, the Washington Post reported recently that ""nearly 90 percent of the country's approximately 16,000 law enforcement agencies either choose not to supply data for those FBI statistics, or report no hate crimes in their jurisdictions,"" leaving us all in the dark about how often these crimes are actually committed.

What most people -- especially women -- remember about Onfroy other than his music is his multiple and horrifying domestic abuse charges.

Between May and October of 2016, he allegedly assaulted his ex-girlfriend, Geneva Ayala, repeatedly. According to her deposition , he threatened to put either a barbecue fork or wire brush up her vagina (her choice) because she had complimented a male friend. By July, he allegedly threatened to kill her ""literally like every day."" When she hummed along to a guest artist's verse on one of Onfroy's songs, she said he head-butted, punched and stomped on her, threatening to cut out her tongue.

After Ayala found out she was pregnant in August, the abuse allegedly escalated. Onfroy was arrested and charged with aggravated battery of a pregnant woman, domestic battery by strangulation, false imprisonment and witness tampering. He denied the charges for the rest of his life.

This is the cause of the collective and posthumous vitriol and I understand it perfectly. I grew up amid that sort of ferocity. As I have alleged elsewhere, my father , who I have forcibly removed from my life, abused my mother in every way possible: physically, emotionally, financially, and sexually. They divorced when I was 2, but from my studies of complex post-traumatic stress disorder, I know that while I can't remember specifics of what happened back then, my still-forming brain grew accustomed to his behavior, even normalized it.

Like Onfroy, my father also grew up in an impoverished home riddled with abuse and, last I knew, mirrored Onfroy's apparent lack of regret for the hurt he caused others. This is not a matter of coincidence; several studies have shown that boys who witness violence grow up to become perpetrators themselves. However awful it may be that boys are conditioned to repeat their own cruel pasts, there is no excuse for these vicious crimes in adulthood. There is no punishment strong enough to provide retribution for their victims.

XXXTentacion's death has also raised for the question: if my father died, would that lessen the impact of what havoc he's wrought upon my life? Would it provide me closure? Sadly, I don't think so. There are even scientific studies that suggest it won't.

Indeed, co-victim therapist Lula Redmond says , ""Taking a life doesn't fill that void [of losing a loved one], but it's generally not until after the execution that families realize this."" Another study, conducted at Marquette University, posits that life sentences may provide more opportunities for co-victims to heal, that they ""may prefer the finality of a life sentence and the obscurity into which the defendant will quickly fall, to the continued uncertainty and publicity of the death penalty.""

Ayala herself seems to feel this way. The day after Onfroy was killed, she tweeted , ""It's disgusting that people are speaking for me. i don't care if no one cared about me however many months ago, i didn't lose my life. he did. it's permanent. i'm still here. like how do you think that makes me feel? everyone expecting me to be relieved or happy?! no, i'm broken.""

When she was kicked out of Onfroy's recent memorial-cum-street riot and her vigil offerings were burned, Ayala expressed her anger and grief on Instagram. In one video, she's sobbing in dismay.

This is why I refuse to make Onfroy's death personal, to get angry, to celebrate or to relish that he's gone. While his ex-girlfriend, his friends and his family have an intimate connection with him and his murder, engaging with his life and death only draws attention to the darkest parts of my life.

I refuse to let someone I was vaguely aware of affect me that way -- in any way.

Experts say laser pointers should never be considered toys

(CNN) A 9-year-old boy in Greece permanently injured his left eye when he repeatedly gazed into a laser pointer's green beam, doctors say.

Examination revealed a large hole in the macula, a small area in the retina that helps with discerning detail in faces and while reading or driving, the doctors said in a case report published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. Further imaging revealed two more injured areas below the macular hole.

Fascinating, mysterious, and medically amazing case files. This series is the most interesting education into the world of medicine and disease and the human body.

Macular holes are typically treated with surgery that is accompanied with an almost 100% risk of cataract formation, Dr. Sofia Androudi, a physician involved with the case, wrote in an email. Cataracts cause blurry vision by clouding the eyes' clear lenses.

However, in this case, because the macular hole resulted from the laser burn, the nerves in the eye that absorb light were totally damaged, said Androudi, an assistant professor of ophthalmology at the University of Thessaly in Greece. ""This means that even if the surgery would be successful, the boy would not be able to see.""

The boy's vision was measured at 20/20 in his right eye and 20/100 in his left, according to the report. A person with a visual acuity of 20/100 would have to be within 20 feet of a point of focus in order to see what a person with normal vision can see at 100 feet.

48,48,2018-05-10 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Hoi An, Vietnam (CNN) New Yorker Neal Bermas had traveled around the world, but Vietnam literally stopped him in his tracks.

There, the businessman saw starving children in Ho Chi Minh City while on a trip to Asia in 1999.

""There were bands of these poor, homeless kids on the streets ... and they were begging for milk, not for money,"" Bermas said. ""It stayed with me.""

Bermas, who did consulting for hotels and restaurants, saw there was an effort under way to help street kids get simple food service jobs. He realized he could help.

Combining his business savvy with an ambitious nonprofit model, in 2007 he co-founded STREETS International , based in Hoi An. The organization provides at-risk young people with a rigorous 18-month training program, preparing them for careers in Vietnam's booming culinary and hospitality industries.

""(They) come from the whole country with all kinds of very, very difficult paths,"" Bermas said. ""We offer them a structured program and a very rich apprenticing experience.""

STREETS' participants range in age from 16 to 22. The group provides housing, meals, medical care, clothing and support services to help trainees gain skills and confidence for employment at top resorts.

Some come from more than 600 miles away to participate in the free program. They receive a stipend and transportation assistance to visit their family.

""We build possibilities and aspirations for those communities,"" Bermas said. ""Where we take one young person from the village, suddenly ... the whole village starts to think about, 'maybe my kid, too.'""

Currently, 75 trainees are enrolled. The group's full-time staff and teachers are all Vietnamese, and Bermas often brings in chefs and other experts to enhance the training.

He and his team work with the government and ensure they follow all safety and labor laws and regulations.

JUST WATCHED CNN Hero Neal Bermas: 'Oodles of Noodles' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Hero Neal Bermas: 'Oodles of Noodles' 02:39

By the end of this year, nearly 250 young people will have completed the program. Bermas said 100% of STREETS graduates have found employment, mostly at four- and five-star hotels in Vietnam.

""It works. And that's a push to do more to reach more young people,"" he said, adding that the group stays in regular contact with all graduates for at least two years after graduation, most longer.

Bermas plans to expand the program to other areas of the country.

CNN's Allie Torgan spoke with Bermas about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: Who are the young people applying to your program?

Bermas: All the young people in our program come from poverty -- without enough to eat, without electricity and plumbing. From leprosy villages, from HIV backgrounds; some have been trafficked, sometimes more than once.

Part of the process of selecting and getting to know the trainees is that we visit wherever they're from -- the home, in many cases the orphanage, the NGO, the isolated village, sometimes even a street corner. We want to know the most about them we possibly can, how difficult their conditions have been and how they have been wounded by life. Or what support there is. It's a great resource to a young person's development in our program.

This is the first real chance for many (of them) to transition from poverty and life on the streets to the dignity of self-sufficiency that comes with a successful career. You shouldn't discount a young person's future because of their past, no matter how dire it's been.

CNN: You've created an extensive program. Besides the hands-on culinary and hospitality training, what else is involved?

Bermas: There's a whole team of colleagues, educators and professionals who have worked developing all this. We have daily curriculums and lesson plans, from the first day to the last day -- designed to deliver quite sophisticated, substantive material.

We have a computer language lab. We have tutoring every day of the week. English language instruction is a big part. And a whole array of life skills, from hygiene to CPR, budgeting and banking, physical exercise and being healthy.

Depending on which track the trainees are going, they have classroom experience in a small teaching kitchen if they're becoming professional chefs, or in the classroom to learn about hospitality and service. And our three eateries have many purposes; each one brings a different set of skills for apprenticing.

CNN: You left Manhattan behind to do this. Why did you decide to move to Vietnam?

Bermas: The truth is, the early vision was that I would work with colleagues and assemble a team here. And I could travel back and forth and make sure everything was going well.

It became clear very early on that if I was to really realize this ambition on behalf of the young people in the program, I would have to be here and do it. It was probably the best, if not certainly the most meaningful, decision I've made in my adult life.

This work at STREETS is never easy, but it's important. I know now that I need to be sure there is a STREETS around 10 years from now.

CNN: You've kept your focus on the local community. How have they embraced you?

Bermas: It's traditional here in Vietnam when you open a new business that the business community and friends and family all send you large wreaths of flowers opening day to wish you good luck.

The day we opened the restaurant -- we'd been working so hard to open, to get this thing going -- and I came down the street, and there were so many of these big, beautiful wreaths full of flowers that said in Vietnamese, ""Congratulations"" and ""Welcome."" And who had sent them? All the local shops and friends we had made. I was so touched by this.

The flowers poured out into the street. It was amazing. I literally couldn't get in the front door of the restaurant.

(CNN) The World Cup is here and -- even if they failed to qualify to play in Russia -- Americans are going to be hearing the word ""soccer"" a lot for the next four weeks ... if not the next eight years, with news that the US, Mexico and Canada have won the contest to host the 2026 tournament.

What a beautiful thing for the beautiful game that America can get along well enough with its ""arch rivals"" Mexico to put on the world's biggest sporting event.

Or let me put it another way: What the hell is going on here? As the next month will demonstrate, soccer is not merely a game but a chance for a series of geo-political entanglements, a settling of scores and an opportunity to lord it over the rest of the world.

Let this expat Englishman living in the United States explain what's at stake here.

Soccer was a long way from cool in England when I attended my first match in 1981. Our teams were dominant in Europe but attendance was in decline.

My grandmother's friends in Birmingham made clear to my father that he was mad to consider taking a 7-year-old boy to a home game. At least leave before the end, they counseled him.

We did (after a 1-1 draw with Everton). But not to ""beat the rush,"" as Americans might say today. We left early to avoid the crowd violence that typically followed Birmingham City's home games in those days.

England's national sport was infected with the cancer of hooliganism back then. Being a fan meant each game carried a risk of being caught up in a brawl.

Football -- as we call the sport in England (except for the truly posh who use ""soccer,"" the antiquated abbreviation of Association Football that lives on in the US) -- with its drab stadiums, nondescript meat pies and casual violence had an image problem.

Things have changed since then. The racist monkey calls that greeted black players are gone. The big clubs all have sparkling new facilities. And the broadsheet newspapers, which once looked down on the sport, print extra sections to cover the results.

Any budding politician has to have a favorite team -- even if we know they spent their teenage years reading political biographies, not kicking a ball around in the park.

Yet some things never change. Have you watched a Premier League game on TV? Notice how there are fewer team jerseys on display than at the average NFL game or MLS fixture. Particularly among those who have traveled to support the away team.

Wearing football shirts remains the fastest way to be barred from entering a pub.

I grew up with ""no colors"" signs hanging in pub windows. Nothing to do with race, just the fear that the barroom would become a battlefield after too many beers.

Even now, to wear a soccer jersey in public in England is freighted with symbolism: A demonstration of working-class solidarity or an indicator of questionable manners and uneven temperament, depending on your point of view.

JUST WATCHED Ronaldo: 'Neymar is our biggest hope' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Ronaldo: 'Neymar is our biggest hope' 02:31

So I can never quite get used to the attitude in the US, where a soccer jersey means something else altogether and the attitude to the game is completely different. The sport is newer here. And foreign.

There are the immigrants, of course, who bring their love of the game from Latin America and around the world, whose colors are a badge of who they are and who they belong with.

But it is also the uniform of a metropolitan elite that is cosmopolitan in temperament and internationalist in outlook. A Barcelona jersey is about not just the sport or the club or Lionel Messi, the team's star, but about a mindset.

The wearer has eschewed the ritualized violence of American football and the nostalgia of baseball, in favor of the grace and invention of the very simplest of sports, one that needs no razzmatazz injected into halftime shows. And with that comes a tacit rejection of American exceptionalism, and the notion that the winners of the World Series or the Super Bowl can be the world champions of anything.

It is the sport for American globalists and liberals.

By the way, these people are sickening to watch a game with, what with always pointing out an interesting piece they've just read in The New Yorker or offering their tasting notes on a craft IPA.

Their advantage is to be part of something new, something that does not come with baggage. It is a clean slate. For the first time many US fans are coming to terms with the pain of missing out on their national team qualifying.

How different that feels. We England fans know the weight of our baggage, whether the eruptions of violence that still follow our team or the terrace chants that celebrate a time long passed.

While the rest of the world celebrates the global game, we want the world to know that no matter what you may have heard, we invented it.

50,50,2018-06-23 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Ever since he left the White House, Steve Bannon has been scouring the world for new opportunities to promote his brand of populism: a revolt against liberal elites, migration and multiculturalism -- and the revival of the nation state.

Bannon, once Donald Trump's ideological sidekick, has found the perfect partner in Matteo Salvini, Italy's Interior Minister and leader of the League, one of two parties in the new coalition government in Rome.

Salvini is an admirer of Vladimir Putin, prefers social media to mainstream media, trumpets economic nationalism and makes controversial remarks about foreigners and migrants. He's ripped more than a few pages out of Trump's playbook. Even his election slogan was ""Italians first.""

In the past week, as the United States has been consumed by the treatment of migrant families at the border, Salvini has closed Italian ports to rescue ships carrying migrants. It did him no harm in the polls. The League is two percentage points higher than at the beginning of June.

Just as Trump's supporters railed against illegal migrants crossing the Mexican border, so Italians were infuriated by Europe's disjointed response to the surge in migration across the Mediterranean, which left the countries where migrants landed dealing with most of the burden. More than 600,000 have landed in Italy since 2013.

""The burden should have been shared,"" Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said this month.

Still more controversial is Salvini's announcement of a census of Italy's Roma population. Last year, he said: ""We need a mass cleansing, street by street, piazza by piazza, neighborhood by neighborhood. We need to be tough because there are entire parts of our cities, entire parts of Italy, that are out of control.""

He suggested then that Italy needed policies similar to those championed by President Trump. This week, Trump said: ""We have to have a very tough policy"" on illegal immigration. ""We have no choice.""

An unlikely alliance

The League came to power this month in coalition with the Five Star Movement (5SM), another insurgent, anti-establishment party.

Bannon says that when the two parties emerged as the largest in the March elections, he pitched an unlikely alliance of 5SM and the League to Salvini, telling him : ""You are the first guys who can really break the left and right paradigm.""

It was music to Salvini's ears. In 2015 he had told political scientist Alessandro Franzi : ""The distinction between right and left is no longer effective, because today the alternative is between those who are small and those who are big, between the people and the European financial establishment.""

The Bannon/Salvini playbook goes far beyond migration. Bannon told an audience in Italy: ""Look at how they roll. Foreign powers, foreign capital, foreign media took from the Italian people its sovereignty.""

That anti-corporate tone is at the heart of the new coalition's platform

Bannon saw similar in Trump's candidacy -- one that shook up party allegiances as Trump tapped into the anger of those he called the ""less educated,"" those marginalized by automation, the decline of manufacturing and migrants willing to work for less. Even this week, Trump was having another go at the elites

Last month, Bannon said: ""The working-class, blue-collar workers in the US and the middle class were completely abused by the globalist elite that ran the country for the last 20 or 30 years and Trump's victory was a complete rejection of that.""

He made those remarks in Hungary, whose leader, Viktor Orban, he sees as another flag-bearer in this revolution. Orban is ""Trump before Trump,"" Bannon declared. This week Orban said that Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia had agreed to establishing ""hot spot"" centers to process migrants outside EU borders.

Bannon sees much of Europe as fertile territory for his populist revolution. In March he appeared at the conference of the far-right Front National in France, saying: ""Let them call you racist. Wear it as a badge of honor.""

He is also close to Nigel Farage, the public face of the Brexit movement and former leader of the UK Independence Party.

Another popular target for Bannon, Salvini, Farage and the rest of the insurgency is the mainstream media. In an interview this year, Bannon called the Financial Times, the BBC, the Wall Street Journal and the Economist "" the propaganda department of the globalists .""

The real threat is ""a democracy reduced to the tyranny of tiny majorities who find emotional satisfaction in a violent, resentful rhetoric while their narrowly elected leaders strip away their rights and persecute their neighbors."" Historian James McDougall

Salvini (like Trump) has gotten more personal. This week the author Roberto Saviano said: ""Italians are going backwards socially, amid an upsurge of nationalism that displays racist animus against anything perceived to be an alien body."" Salvini responded by threatening to withdraw the police protection Saviano has had since writing an exposé of the mafia.

Plenty of column inches have been devoted to describing these populist movements as harbingers of a new fascism, whose leaders pick on minorities, use covert and overt racism, undermine the principle that dissent is part of democracy, promote economic nationalism and decry international cooperation.

But parallels with the 1930s are overdone (where are the mass unemployment and the shock troops on the streets?). Historian James McDougall says the real threat is ""a democracy reduced to the tyranny of tiny majorities who find emotional satisfaction in a violent, resentful rhetoric while their narrowly elected leaders strip away their rights and persecute their neighbors.""

French President Macron said Thursday that such forces were rising ""a bit like a leprosy all across Europe, in countries where we thought that it would be impossible to see them again.""

French President Emmanuel Macron has described the populist wave as ""a bit like a leprosy.""

Salvini, like Farage and Bannon, says such criticism is the inevitable whining of the elites as their control wanes. When Macron criticized Italy's refusal to accept 600 migrants stranded on board a rescue vessel, Salvini dismissed him as a ""chatterbox.""

""There are those who talk and those who act,"" Salvini said.

51,51,2018-06-20 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Mohammed Abdiker is director of operations and emergencies for the UN Migration Agency. The views expressed in this commentary are solely his.

(CNN) Last year, nearly 100,000 migrants entered Yemen, a country gripped by conflict and the world's worst humanitarian crisis . That's 2,000 migrants entering a warzone per week; nearly 300 a day.

The majority start out from Ethiopia, and some from Somalia, and usually head to the Gulf in search of work, with Saudi Arabia being the top destination. People embarking on this route are typically under 25, but many are children

The stories we hear from them are the same; they know someone who has gone before and ""made it."" Someone who has sent enough money home to build their parents a house, put their brother through school or regenerate their family farm affected by years of drought. Migrants often cite these examples as proof that once they reach their destination they will be able to pull themselves and their loved ones out of poverty.

It is this mix of desperation and naivety that smugglers unscrupulously exploit.

Abuse, torture and kidnapping

It is almost impossible to travel this route (Ethiopia-Djibouti-Yemen-the Gulf) without enlisting a smuggler at some point and if a migrant tries to go it alone at all, they are putting themselves at greater risk because it's ""bad for business"" for the vast smuggling networks. Many migrants, including young people, suffer appalling treatment from cruel smugglers and other criminals, including physical and sexual abuse, torture, kidnapping for ransom (from families who can't afford to pay), arbitrary detention for long periods of time, forced labor, trafficking and even death.

In Yemen, migrants also often get caught up in the conflict, sustaining injuries or even dying from shelling, and some are taken to detention centers.

No migrant should be held in detention, especially children, and IOM, the UN Migration Agency, advocates for their closure and offers its support to the authorities to improve conditions. In Yemen, we currently only have access to two detention centers out of an unknown total.

Ethiopian migrants sleep on the beach at Djibouti City.

On a recent visit to Yemen, I went to a migrant holding facility in the capital, Sana'a, where I met teenagers in utter distress. I put a question to the room of over 200 migrants, mostly young men: if I could bring a bus or plane to take you home right now, would you want to go?

They all raised their hands, showing how desperately they wanted out.

How many are trafficked?

These are worrying similarities to the horrendous abuse that migrants face on the Central Mediterranean Route from West Africa through Libya to Europe. But migrants in Yemen only attract a fraction of the world's attention and demands for protection and support. Not to mention the lack of funding from the international community. For example, did you know that that thousands of migrants were stranded in or near the frontlines of the recent military offensive on Yemen's busy port city of Hodeidah?

But we also do not know the true size of the problem, because of the security situation in the country and the danger it would pose to our staff to expose them to these violent smuggling networks. We do not know how many migrants are in Yemen, how many stay there to work or make it to the Gulf. We do not know how many are held captive by smugglers or are in official detention centers. We do not know how many are being trafficked.

However, during 2017 we have been able to track 87,000 migrants in the country through our Displacement Tracking teams, and provide humanitarian assistance to more than 33,000 migrants.

A survivor's story

One person who our team on the ground helped, was a 14-year-old boy named Mohammed. He wanted to travel from Ethiopia to Saudi Arabia to find work and hopefully save some money. He left his home with some friends without telling his relatives. They walked several hundred miles, while hungry and thirsty.

Risking drowning in the sea, they crossed from Djibouti to Yemen. When they got to Yemen, Mohammed says he and his friends were abducted by smugglers in an area where there is ongoing fighting. He says the smugglers abused him physically and only released him once they had extorted money from him and his friends through their families back home.

Attempting to then travel through the country to the border, they were seriously injured by an explosion. An ambulance took Mohammed and five others to a hospital. According to Mohammed, two female migrants died and the other migrants from his group were never found. Mohammed was transferred to the prison in Hodeidah, which is where IOM met him and provided him with assistance.

Following this near-death experience at such a young age, Mohammed asked us to help him return home to Ethiopia, which we did earlier this year.

No other option

The vast majority of migrants who come to our centers or receive any aid from us on this route are men. But when we speak to the migrants, they tell us there are plenty of women traveling. It worries me that we are hardly reaching these women.

Migrants at an IOM Migration Reception Point, where they receive medical check-ups and other assistance.

As thousands of migrants enter Yemen, IOM is helping many get home, offering safe and dignified passage funded by Saudi Arabia, Germany, the Czech Republic and the US. However, the situation they face when they get home is far from ideal.

For Ethiopian returnees, we only have funding to help a few vulnerable cases reintegrate into their home communities. With no support to restart their lives, they will be no better off than when they left (in fact, they are typically worse off, having each paid out $200-1,000 to smugglers) and they are likely to attempt the journey again. They simply feel like they have no other option.

Not only do donors need to provide more support, countries of origin, transit and destination should redouble efforts to develop legal and safe migration channels within the region.

Countries along the route -- Djibouti, Somalia, Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia -- are already doing a lot. I would like to thank them and encourage them to work with us and each other to better protect migrants. There needs to be real consequences for those at the top rungs of these smuggling networks and efforts need to be made by concerned countries to support communities along the route so that they do not engage in or facilitate this abuse.

52,52,2018-06-21 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) The US Navy's newest aircraft carrier is regarded as the world's most-advanced warship -- but for how much longer?

Aircraft launched by electromagnetic catapults can get airborne quicker and with greater quantities of fuel and ammunition, giving them an advantage over planes launched by standard steam catapult.

For decades, US carriers have used steam catapult systems, where steam explodes into a piston attached to the plane's landing gear, powering it off the deck. Besides the Ford, the other 10 carriers in the US fleet use steam catapults.

Currently, Chinese carriers launch planes using a use a different, less advanced system, known as the ski-jump, meaning planes rely on their own power when lifting off.

The US Navy touts the electromagnetic system as capable of launching a wider range of aircraft at a better pace and requiring less maintenance. It's also planned for the next ships in the Ford class, the USS John F Kennedy and USS Enterprise.

China has been undergoing an extensive naval modernization and expansion program, and a carrier to equal the US ships has long been thought to be an ambition of Beijing.

The story gave new support to that. Written by the state-owned Global Times and posted on the PLA's website, the story centers around a photo that is ""believed to be the country's first aircraft carrier equipped with an electromagnetic aircraft launch system.""

The photo in question was released by the No.701 Research Institute of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation and shows China's two current ski-jump carriers flanking a larger ship with a flat deck.

That flat deck ""makes an electromagnetic aircraft launch system possible,"" the story says, citing military expert Song Zhongping.

""Three catapults on board show that the new ship will be able to launch aircraft faster and more frequently than the previous carriers, and therefore will possess stronger combat capabilities,"" the Global Times story goes on to say.

The story included speculation that the new carrier is already under construction in Shanghai.

The new flat-top carrier would be China's second domestically built carrier and its third carrier in total, following the acquisition and refit of a former Ukrainian vessel.

Last month, its first homegrown carrier , a 50,000-ton ship temporarily named Type 001A, began its first sea trials. The PLA's website reported Wednesday that those trials were successfully completed this week. The Type 001A is expected to officially join the PLA Navy's fleet sometime before 2020.

But experts said while the Type 001A will dramatically boost China's military power in the Asia region, its technology was still outdated and lagged far behind the American fleet.

""This is, in and of itself, not designed to be some frontal challenge to US power in the Asia Pacific, because it simply isn't in the class of America's aircraft carriers,"" Sam Roggeveen, senior fellow at Sydney's Lowy Institute, told CNN in May.

China's first carrier, the Liaoning, a retrofitted Soviet-era vessel bought from the Ukraine, was hailed as the fulfillment of a ""70-year dream"" of the Chinese nation when it launched to much celebration in 2012.",Will China have aircraft carrier that can match US Navy's?,http://cnn.com/2018/06/21/asia/china-new-aircraft-carrier-electromagnetic-catapult-intl/index.html
53,53,2018-06-24 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Almost 350 migrants are stranded on two boats in the Mediterranean, including a Danish cargo ship, as a standoff between nearby European countries deepened on Sunday.

The boats include German rescue ship, Lifeline, which picked up 234 people and 17 crew members off the coast of Libya on Thursday; and a cargo ship operated by Danish transportation company Maersk, which picked up another 113 migrants off the coast of Libya on Friday morning.

Both boats have been barred from docking at nearby Italy and Malta, as the countries urged other European nations to take in the stranded migrants.

The standoff comes weeks after Italy and Malta refused to accept another rescue ship, the Aquarius , which was carrying over 600 migrants. After two days drifting in the Mediterranean the migrants were accepted by Spain, exposing the tough new policies of Italy's hardline interior minister and leader of the anti-immigration League party, Matteo Salvini.

'Dear Salvini, we have no meat on board, just humans'

Salvini doesn't appear to be backing down on his tough stance anytime soon. Last week he warned the Dutch-flagged ship operated by the German nongovernmental organization Lifeline, currently stranded in the Mediterranean with over 200 migrants on board, not to dock in Italian ports.

""You (Lifeline) did a show of strength by contravening the indications of the Italian and Libyan coast guard. Now, you'll carry this human load to the Netherlands,"" Salvini said in a Facebook live video from his office.

On Sunday, Lifeline responded to Salvini in a Twitter post, saying: ""Dear @matteosalvinimi, we have no meat on board, but humans. We cordially invite you to convince yourself that it is people we have saved from drowning. Come here, you are welcome!""

Maersk answers Italy's call for help

Similarly, Italy has also refused to allow the Maersk cargo ship, which is carrying over 100 migrants and is located south of Sicily, to dock in its ports. That's despite the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Center calling Maersk on Thursday night and asking for it to rescue the migrants, a Maersk spokesman told CNN.

The cargo ship had been traveling between Libya and Malta at the time, the spokesman said, adding that ""it is now denied a port of entry and the company is awaiting further instruction from authorities.""

Migrants board the Danish Maersk cargo ship in darkness on Friday.

The ship is roughly three sea miles from the port of Pozzallo in Sicily, Italian Coast Guard press officer Commander Cosimo Nicastro told CNN. He added that of the 113 migrants rescued, five have since been brought to shore for medical reasons, including an eight-months pregnant woman and her partner, and a young girl that needed medical assistance with her mother and sister.

Lifeline ship near the coast of Malta

Axel Steier, a spokesman for Lifeline, told CNN Saturday that the ship was around 40 miles south of the Maltese coast.

However Malta has refused to allow the ship to dock, with Prime Miniser Joseph Muscat saying in a government statement that the rescue had taken place in the Libyan rescue zone and that it had been coordinated by the Italian authorities, and later by the Libyan authorities.

Migrants on a rubber boat are rescued by the Lifeline ship on Thursday.

Given these circumstances, Malta is under no obligation to take in the ship, he said, even though the vessel is in the Maltese rescue zone.

That said, Malta has twice given food and drink supplies to the stranded ship, the Malta Ambassador to Italy, Vanessa Frazier, told CNN.

Blame game continues

Meanwhile, the fiery exchange between Italy and Malta continued over the weekend, with Italian transportation minister Danilo Toninelli calling the Maltese decision not to allow the Lifeline to dock ""inhumane"" and ""absurd"" on his Facebook page on Saturday.

Malta's Minister for Home Affairs and National Security, Michael Farrugia, responded with tweets asking Toninelli to get his facts right and accusing Lifeline of breaking ""international rules.""

Immigration continues to be a controversial issue for EU member states. During the recent federal election campaign that led to Italy's new government -- a coalition between the anti-immigrant League and anti-establishment Five Star Movement -- Salvini promoted his party with an ""Italians first"" slogan and pledged to deport half a million migrants.

At an informal EU summit on immigration in Brussels on Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared keen to manage expectations that European leaders could reach a broad agreement on migration, telling journalists that countries will need to work on bilateral and trilateral deals with one another instead of waiting for all 28 EU member countries to come to an agreement.

Desperate migrants on a deadly route

The Mediterranean remains the world's deadliest migration route, despite sharp falls in the number of people trying to reach Europe by boat. That drop is partly ascribed to a deal struck between Italy and Libya last year, in which the southern European country pledged to bolster Libya's coast guard so it could spot departing migrant boats and house migrants attempting to cross.",Almost 350 migrants are stranded on two boats in the Mediterranean,http://cnn.com/2018/06/24/europe/maersk-lifeline-migrants-stranded-mediterranean-intl/index.html

55,55,2018-06-21 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) The leaders of Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, and the Czech Republic have decided not to attend this weekend's mini summit on migration, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced.

President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker is convening the emergency meeting in Brussels on Sunday in an effort to overhaul the EU's asylum system, which has put a strain on the bloc's frontier countries, where refugees continue to arrive daily.

The highly unusual move comes after a rescue ship packed with 630 people was turned away by Italy and Malta, once again exposing deep divisions on migration policies within the EU. The boat eventually docked in the port of Valencia after Spain offered to accept those on board.

""We understand that there will be a mini-summit on Sunday... but we would like to clearly state that the prime ministers of the V4 agreed that they will not go to that,"" Orban said in Budapest on Thursday.

The V4, or Visegrád Four, is the grouping of Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, and the Czech Republic, which have all rejected proposals from other European countries to allow a certain number of refugees into their nations.

In a statement to CNN, Orban's office said the issue of migration should be debated by the European Council -- which includes the leaders of all EU countries -- not the European Commission, which is the EU's executive arm. A European Council meeting is scheduled for the end of next week.

""We understand that there are internal political difficulties in some countries, but this cannot result in some pan-European frenzy,"" Orban said in the statement from his office.

The veiled statement may have been aimed at German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has less than two weeks to agree on a new migration policy with European leaders or face a renewed rebellion from her own government that is threatening to bring her 13-year rule to an end.

The architect of the division is her interior minister, Horst Seehofer of the Christian Social Union (CSU) -- the Bavarian sister party to Merkel's own Christian Democratic Union (CDU).

Seehofer last week defied Merkel to announce a tough new immigration policy that would see some asylum seekers turned away at the borders of Germany. He had suggested he could implement the proposals unilaterally, in defiance of both European regulations and the chancellor.

As most asylum seekers arrive and register first in Greece, Italy, or Spain, that would mean getting those countries to agree to take them back.

56,56,2018-06-14 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Gaithersburg, Maryland (CNN) When Rob Scheer was 12 years old, he ended up in foster care after a childhood filled with violence and abuse.

As he moved through the system, he carried his limited belongings in a trash bag. Yet he was determined to overcome the obstacles.

""I was not going to allow that trash bag to define me,"" Scheer, now 51, remembers.

He went on to join the US Navy and launch a successful corporate career, and he always knew he wanted to be a father.

In 2008, Scheer and his husband, Reece Scheer, decided they would adopt children out of foster care. Soon after, a pair of siblings arrived at their home. A few months later, another set joined them.

All the children showed up with their belongings in trash bags.

""I couldn't believe it. The trash bag that I had carried so many years prior to that had found its way back into my life,"" Rob Scheer said.

""It's just not acceptable that any child should carry their belongings in something that we all throw our trash in and dispose of.""

The couple adopted the four children, and as a family, the Scheers began compiling supplies to donate to local foster children. Their nonprofit, Comfort Cases , was born.

""We started building cases for kids that came into foster care, making sure that they had the basics,"" Scheer said.

The backpacks are loaded with necessities like soap and toothbrushes, along with a book, journal, blanket, stuffed animal and other items.

Since 2013, the group has assembled more than 20,000 Comfort Cases for children in foster care all over the country.

""We want to make them feel loved,"" Scheer said.

CNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Scheer about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: You had a very difficult childhood. How were you able to overcome those obstacles?

Rob Scheer: I grew up in a very abusive home. Abuse that most people couldn't even dream about. My parents did drugs and drank, and they thought it was funny to take the gun and hold it to our heads. To them, it was a joke. To me, it was my life. But I had made a choice as a young boy that I wasn't going to be a statistic. I wasn't going to let anyone define the way my path was going to go.

CNN: What was it like when your children first came into your lives?

Scheer: When our kids came to us, they basically had nothing. So, we took them shopping. Every time they would look at something, we'd throw it in the cart. We just wanted them to know that we wanted more for them. Yes, it might be material things, but for a child who's never had (anything), that blanket means a lot.

That day, as we shopped and bought dolls and toys and blocks and puzzles, I noticed that my daughter (Amaya) never smiled. She said, ""Thank you,"" but there was no spark. And I remember saying to Reece, ""This is the happiest day of my life. I've waited for this forever. But I'm the father of the saddest little girl.""

That night, Amaya went into her brand-new bedroom. Reece had laid three nightgowns out that he had just bought at the store. Amaya walked over and she picked up a nightgown and tore the tag off and she smiled. She really smiled. And she looked at me and said, ""I've never owned a new nightgown before."" I do believe that tag opened up a door in my daughter that is hard to understand. not being a child in foster care. I believe that tag reassured my daughter that she was worthy.

CNN: How did you as a family come up with the idea of Comfort Cases?

Scheer: After Amaya and Makai and Tristan and Greyson arrived in our home, and they were all carrying trash bags, I knew that we had to do something. We talked to the kids about what it was like for them on that first night and how they felt. We talked about what a child needs their first night in a foster home.

We remembered what the tag on the new pajamas meant for Amaya, so we knew we needed to include a brand-new pair of pajamas. We also wanted to make sure that they had their own lotion, shampoo, conditioner, bar of soap and deodorant. They shouldn't have to ask for these things on their first night. So, let's give them what we already know they need. I remember being that kid, and I wish somebody would have given me deodorant, my own bar of soap.

CNN: Beyond the necessary items, what are you trying to give foster kids on a deeper level?

Scheer: I want them to know that even though they started their life in the system, the system still is not defining them. I know that they deserve more. I know that in my lifetime, we're going to make sure that children in foster care get the same exact things we give our children.

We must start immediately by no longer allowing children to carry trash bags. And then we must also start by making sure that these children feel wanted.

High-volume foods such as soups can fill you up on fewer calories than solid foods

(CNN) ""Intermittent fasting,"" a dieting approach that involves cycling between periods of eating and abstaining from food, has been trending in diet circles. This is in part because reports claim that celebrities such as Beyonce, Hugh Jackman, Ben Affleck and Nicole Kidman are doing it but also because increasingly more research reveals that the eating pattern may promote weight loss and improve overall health.

The method is not appropriate for everyone, however, particularly pregnant women and those with medical conditions such as diabetes or eating disorders. And though studies are promising, it remains to be seen if this type of eating can become a sustainable lifestyle habit instead of a drop-a-dress-size-in-a-week fad.

""The jury is still out, especially on how healthy, sustainable and realistic this approach is,"" said Samantha Heller, a registered dietitian and senior clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Health in New York. ""Eating very low calories, or none, on alternate days feels punitive to many and may exacerbate an already difficult and complex relationship someone has with food.""

Damage to the children and their parents, and damage to the United States and what it stands for.

Ariel Dorfman

I think of them in the dark, when their keepers have turned off the lights, when the children sob themselves to sleep. I think of when they awake and neither mamá or papá are there, just other kids and unknown adults hovering nearby, strangers charged with caring for their basic needs. I think of the toddlers, above all, eating their American breakfast, old enough to be asking a question in Spanish -- dónde está mi mami? -- and the inevitable answer in English, your mother's not here.

I can imagine how the children try to please their elders, suffocate their emotional turmoil, smile at the new faces they have never seen before in this country that does not belong to them and does not want them. My obsession with the children who are still detained, right now, in what the Trump administration calls, without any sense of shame or irony, ""tender age"" facilities, does not stem only from the outrage I share with so many decent citizens.

In my case, there is a special reason why my heart goes out to those victims of a cruel and inhumane policy. I know, from my own severe experience, that those youngsters have been irreparably harmed.

I was only two and a half years old when I was separated from my parents soon after I arrived in New York City in the bitter winter of 1945. Like the undocumented children of 2018, I had been given no say in the decision to emigrate, merely dragged along when my family had escaped fascist persecution in our native Argentina.

60,60,2018-05-21 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Eating an egg a day may lower your risk of cardiovascular disease, a study of more than 400,000 adults in China suggests.

Daily egg eaters had an 18% lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, which manifests as heart attacks and strokes, compared with adults who avoided eggs, according to the research published Monday in the journal Heart.

Commonly called heart disease, cardiovascular disease includes heart failure, arrhythmias and heart valve problems in addition to strokes and attacks. Raised blood pressure, carrying too much weight or obesity, and elevated blood sugar all contribute to the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is triggered by unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, smoking and harmful use of alcohol.

'Controversial' nutrition source

In the past, doctors sometimes warned patients to avoid eating too many eggs

Though eggs contain high-quality protein and other positive nutritional components, they also have high amounts of cholesterol, which was thought might be harmful, explained Canqing Yu , a co-author of the study and an associate professor in the Peking University School of Public Health in Beijing.

Yet ""existing studies on the association between egg and cardiovascular diseases are controversial due to small sample size and limited information,"" Yu wrote in an email. Past studies have provided only limited evidence from the Chinese population, ""which have huge differences in dietary habits, lifestyle behaviors and diseases patterns,"" Yu said.

These are among the reasons why he and his colleagues decided to investigate the relationship between eating eggs and cardiovascular disease.

To begin, they used information from an ongoing study of half a million adults living in 10 regions of China. They concentrated on 416,213 participants who'd never been diagnosed with cancer, cardiovascular disease or diabetes.

Slightly more than 13% of these adults, ranging in age from 30 to 79, said they ate about an egg a day while just over 9% reported never or very rarely enjoying an egg. Nearly all the participants ate chicken, not duck, eggs, Yu noted.

Over nearly nine years, the research team tracked this select group. They focused on major coronary events, such as heart attacks and strokes , including hemorrhagic strokes -- when a blood vessel bursts in the brain due, usually, to uncontrolled high blood pressure -- and ischemic strokes -- when a blood vessel feeding the brain becomes blocked, usually by a blood clot.

""Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of deaths in China, which accounted for half of the total mortality,"" Yu said. ""Stroke, including hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, is the first cause of premature death, followed by ischemic heart disease.""

During follow-up, 9,985 people died of cardiovascular disease, and an additional 5,103 major coronary events occurred. Nearly 84,000 other participants were diagnosed with heart disease in this time period.

Analyzing the data, the researchers found that eating about an egg a day related to a lower risk of heart disease compared with not eating eggs.

In fact, participants who ate up to one egg daily had a 26% lower risk of hemorrhagic stroke, which is more common in China than in the United States or other high-income countries. Additionally, the egg eaters had a 28% lower risk of dying from this type of stroke.

Finally, egg eaters also enjoyed a 12% reduced risk of ischemic heart disease, which is diagnosed in those who show the early signs of gridlocked blood flow to the brain.

Based on the results, Yu said, eating eggs in moderation -- less than one a day -- is associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases, especially hemorrhagic stroke. Even more, the new research is ""by far the most powerful project to detect such an effect,"" he said.

On the downside, the research team collected only ""crude information"" about egg consumption from participants, and this prevented them from estimating effects ""more precisely,"" Yu said. ""We should [also] be cautious when interpreting our results in a context of different dietary and lifestyle characteristics from China.""

Part of a healthy diet

Caroline Richard, an assistant professor of agricultural life and environmental sciences at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, said the new study is simply observational and so cannot show a direct cause and effect between eating eggs and risk of heart disease.

""Saying that, this is a very large study, and that in itself is a strength, and the researchers have done the best possible job to control for other factors,"" said Richard, who was not involved in the research.

Her own systematic review of studies showed that when participants are provided with between six and 12 eggs a week, no change occurs in major cardiovascular risk factors, including higher rates of blood sugar, inflammation and cholesterol.

""Several studies in our review observed a positive effect of egg consumption on HDL cholesterol,"" or ""good"" cholesterol, she added.

The new study, then, ""delivers a similar message"" that ""egg consumption does not increase the risk of developing a cardiovascular disease,"" Richard said.

Some studies have suggested that consuming eggs increases the risk of diabetes, she said.

""In this study however, they didn't assess the risk of developing diabetes, which may be because diabetes is a newer disease in the Chinese population and there is not good documentation of who has it,"" Richard said. Still, she noted, ""this will be very important data for helping develop dietary prevention guidelines in China.""

61,61,2018-04-17 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) The battle between the parties for control of the closely divided US Senate has become a contest between the exception and the rule.

The rule is that over the past quarter century, it has grown much more difficult for even the most talented Senate candidates to win in states that usually vote for the other party in presidential races. That trend, which is affecting both parties, has created a very narrow balance of power in the Senate -- and triggered frequent changes of partisan control -- because each side has established a natural advantage at the presidential level in about half the states.

The paradox is that because the balance of power between the two parties is so precarious, the Senate majority now often tips based on the few exceptions to this pattern -- the candidates who find ways to win, in effect, behind enemy lines in states that usually back the other party's presidential nominees.

This year, that test will fall primarily on the five Democratic senators seeking reelection in states that have invariably voted Republican for president in recent years. Five other Democrats are trying to hold seats in states that have been more evenly balanced between the parties, but which tipped to Donald Trump in 2016. By contrast, Dean Heller of Nevada is the only Republican this year defending a Senate seat in a state that Democrats have won in any of the past three presidential elections.

Democrats have an outside chance of regaining the majority in November if they can win in Arizona and Tennessee, states that have leaned reliably Republican in recent presidential elections, but which may be offering new opportunities for the party amid the backlash to Trump among suburban voters and minorities alike. But given how many seats in red-leaning terrain Democrats must defend, the more achievable goal for them this year may be to avoid losses that put the Senate out of reach in 2020 when they will have more pick-up opportunities in states that lean their way in presidential races (Colorado and Maine), are already presidential battlegrounds (North Carolina and Iowa), or may be evolving in that direction (Georgia).

The increasing alignment of states' presidential and Senate preferences reflects the broader decline in split-ticket voting over the past several decades. At its height in the 1970s, about one out of four voters typically voted for one party in the presidential election and the other party in Senate races, according to an analysis by Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz.

US politics is more and more tribal

But the increasingly partisan, even tribal, nature of modern politics has made split-ticket voting much more rare. More voters have started to treat both Senate and House races as quasi-parliamentary elections, viewing them less as a referendum on the merits of the individual candidates than as a choice on which party they prefer to control the chamber. The result, as I have written, is that for congressional candidates, the name on the back of a candidate's jersey now usually matters less than the color on the front of it.

That trend becomes vividly apparent when looking at Senate results through the lens of how states have recently voted for president.

One place to start is 1992, when Bill Clinton's first election shattered the GOP's dominance of the White House over the previous quarter century, and coalesced a new partisan alignment in which Democrats have carried the popular vote in six of the past seven presidential contests (though they have won the Electoral College, and thus the White House, just four times.)

Over those seven elections starting with 1992, 24 states have voted Democratic at least four times. Democrats now hold 40 of their 48 Senate seats, or 83.3%. Over those seven presidential elections, 26 states have voted Republican at least four times. Republicans hold 43 of their 52 Senate seats, a virtually identical 82.6%.

It may be somewhat outdated to characterize states based on their preferences since 1992, however, since Clinton managed to hold a number of blue-collar Southern and border states, including Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Tennessee. Each of those states has grown more reliably Republican since, as the GOP has deepened its hold on older, non-college educated, evangelical and rural white voters. Meanwhile, Colorado, Virginia and Nevada have migrated more reliably into the Democratic camp in presidential contests, amid growing racial diversity and declining Republican strength among well-educated whites.

Democrats have more momentum, Republicans have a much better the map

Comparing the party's Senate results to the presidential outcomes over the past three presidential elections may offer a more revealing map of the opportunities and challenges ahead for the parties.

Measured against that yardstick, the relationship between presidential and Senate preferences remains very powerful. In the three presidential elections starting with 2008, 20 states have voted Democratic all three times: Democrats now hold 37 of their 40 Senate seats. The only Republicans left in these states are Heller, who faces a tough reelection battle this fall, as well as Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine, who will both face reelection in 2020.

Six more states voted twice for Barack Obama but then flipped to Trump in 2016. The parties now evenly divide those states' Senate seats, holding six each. But Democrats in November will be defending five of their six seats in this category. In descending order of vulnerability, they include Bill Nelson in Florida and Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, followed by Sherrod Brown in Ohio, Bob Casey in Pennsylvania and Debbie Stabenow in Michigan. Republicans are not defending any of the seats they hold in these states.

This is partially a matter of timing. Senators serve for six years in a term and Democrats are defending, for the second time, a number of the seats they won in 2006, when they took control of the Senate from Republicans. They lost control in 2014, when Republicans beat several Democrats who had been swept to victory during Barack Obama's resounding win in 2008. Republicans will defend their 2014 gains in 2020.

Moving to the Republican side of the line, Indiana and North Carolina voted for Obama in 2008 but have backed the GOP candidate in the two elections since.

Republicans already hold three of their four Senate seats and Democrats this fall will be defending their sole beachhead in this group: Joe Donnelly in Indiana.

The main event in November's Senate election will unfold in the 22 states that have voted Republican in each of the past three presidential races. Republicans already hold 39 of those states' 44 Senate seats (almost 89%, or just slightly below the Democratic share in the 20 states they have carried three straight times).

But Democrats this year must defend four of their five seats in this group. In descending order of vulnerability they include Claire McCaskill in Missouri, Joe Manchin in West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and Jon Tester in Montana. The twist is that even as Republicans press those opportunities, they must defend Senate seats in at least three other states they have won each time since 2008: Democrats are mounting strong challenges for open Senate seats in Arizona and Tennessee and have found a dynamic, though still long-shot challenger, in Beto O'Rourke in Texas.

Even Mississippi might become a long-shot target for Democrats if Tea Party insurgent Chris McDaniel wins a primary later this year against Cindy Hyde-Smith, the more mainstream Republican that Gov. Phil Bryant recently appointed to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Thad Cochran.

The long-term trajectory in these numbers is toward an unmistakable alignment between the way states vote in presidential and Senate elections. Yet because the parties hold a presidential edge in about the same number of states -- with perhaps just slightly more leaning toward Republicans at this point -- it's the small deviations from the overall trend that may decide Senate control in the years ahead.

How to become the exception to the rule

Three factors seem most important in shaping those exceptions and determining which side controls the upper chamber.

One factor is which side wins what are often very close races in the remaining battleground states where neither side has established a consistent advantage at the presidential level. (I define those as the states that have voted two of the past three for either party, with the exception of Indiana, whose 2008 vote for Obama looks more like an anomaly over time.). Democrats missed a golden opportunity in 2016 to strengthen their hands in these battlegrounds when they failed to beat any of five Republican incumbents in Wisconsin, Ohio, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Florida -- partly because of Hillary Clinton's weakness, especially among blue-collar white voters, in those states. This year, Republicans face a comparable test against the five Democratic incumbents in the states that switched from Obama to Trump.

The second key factor in shaping exceptions is candidates who can either slow or advance the clock in their state's political evolution. The candidates who have stopped the clock are Democrats like Manchin, Heitkamp, and McCaskill, and Republicans such as Collins, who are holding on in states that have long since tilted to the other side in presidential races. None are guaranteed success in their next election, but it's hard to imagine anyone else from their party holding their seats in the near future after they have left the Senate.

Those who advance the clock are candidates who can establish an advance beachhead in states whose loyalties may be shifting at the presidential level. Kyrsten Sinema will try to do that for Democrats in Arizona this year, and the party is likely to make a serious run in 2020 at Republican David Perdue in Georgia. Conversely, it's easy to imagine Republicans making a big push in 2020 for a Senate seat in Minnesota, whose heavily blue-collar demographics will encourage Trump to vigorously contest it, though no Republican presidential nominee has won there since Ronald Reagan in 1980.

Finally, timing matters. Incumbent senators from the party out of the White House have rarely lost in midterm elections since the 1990s. Abramowitz notes that in the 2006, 2010 and 2014 midterms, the only incumbent senators who lost were from the president's party.

""If we were heading toward this midterm with Hillary Clinton in the White House most likely Democrats would be looking at losing several of those (red state) seats,"" he says. ""The thing that is helping them out a lot is it's a midterm with an unpopular Republican president in the White House.""

In states that Democrats are defending such as West Virginia, North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana, Trump is more popular than he is nationally. But he may not be quite as strong even there as he was in 2016. And that small shift may be just enough to allow some of the red state Democrats to defy the mounting odds for senators trying to survive behind enemy lines.",The powerful pattern Democrats must break to win the Senate,http://cnn.com/2018/04/17/politics/the-powerful-pattern-democrats-must-break-to-win-the-senate/index.html

The detainee is among 1,000 immigrants in federal custody who were recently moved to the Victorville Federal Correctional Complex, about 90 miles northeast of Los Angeles, according to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

But John Kostelnik, president of the union representing the prison's workers, said the California facility is understaffed and the arrival of the ICE detainees two weeks ago has made things worse.

""It's causing a lot of chaos, a lot of confusion and quite frankly that confusion can lead to someone being killed or something else going wrong,"" Kostelnik said.

There's not enough doctors to accommodate all the detainees. Other detainees have been diagnosed with scabies and some have tested positive for tuberculosis, Kostelnik said.

63,63,2018-06-21 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Frida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN and The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.

(CNN) When a politician with authoritarian tendencies takes office -- even in a democratic country -- there's no way to know what the future holds. It's easy to take comfort in the prospects for setting everything right in the next election, to feel reassured by massive turnout in protests against excesses, and to believe that democracy is being protected by court rulings, by Congress, and by human decency.

But recent history in the many countries now governed by authoritarian populists has shown that there's more reason for alarm than for comfort, more reason to remain on guard than to relax.

The struggle to defend democratic norms is not only raging in the United States over the treatment of migrant families and over the President's pernicious pattern of lying and attacking the press . It is being fought in a number of nations whose leaders have shown disdain for democratic traditions, with occasionally unexpected results.

Much to just about everyone's surprise , the strongman in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, faces a tough election this Sunday. Erdogan, a NATO ally, has steadily built up his power while destroying democratic protections. The playing field is completely tilted against the opposition. Erdogan's political opponents have been jailed , along with scores of journalists . He has decimated independent media and has deeply polarized the country.

Erdogan may have expected to win in a landslide, but what looked like certain victory was called into question with the Turkish economy's crippling inflation and the opposition finding a firebrand candidate

Ahead of the vote, Erdogan has launched a ""wag-the-dog"" military campaign that looks like an effort to bolster his patriotic support. Many believe Erdogan's rule is in peril. We shall see. The last time Erdogan faced a close vote, on a referendum over increasing the President's power, he ended up winning under circumstances that many deemed unfai r -- a charge that Turkey's Foreign Ministry rejected.

The new fashion in authoritarianism requires preserving a veneer of democracy. That leaves a chink in the armor of strongmen that can create an opening for defenders of liberal democracy, a system that protects individual rights and is based on rule of law, equality -- including for minorities -- a free press, free expression and fair elections, among other things.

The best way to defend against a slide to authoritarianism is by voting against autocratic demagogues. But the power of the ballot grows weaker with every passing day after they take office. That's because autocrats excel at gradualism, increasing their hold on power bit by bit, until democracy becomes a mirage. The process is all the more insidious because demagogues often operate in a cloud of misinformation and propaganda, so the people cannot see their democracy being stolen until it is gone.

Consider Russian President Vladimir Putin's control of the media, which has allowed him to use gaslighting techniques against his critics, to control the story, and keep his approval ratings sky high. All this despite an economy on the mend from its 2015 recession and the thorough dismantlement of Russia's once-promising democratic prospects, complete with the assassination of opposition politicians and critical journalists (which the Kremlin has denied responsibility for). By now and for the foreseeable future, elections offer little solace to pro-democracy Russians.

Or look at Nicaragua, where President Daniel Ortega is now in his fourth term . Ortega and his wife and would-be successor managed to take control of all elements of power and even get a convenient new constitution . But it all popped like a balloon a few weeks ago over the cutting of government pensions. When popular anger exploded, the regime responded with bullets. Now the impoverished country has become a battlefield with an uncertain future

The longer autocrats stay in power, the harder they are to remove. Early on, elections can work. But ask Venezuelans what happened to them. The regime led by President Nicolas Maduro kept up the charade, pretending to be a democracy while monopolizing power. Even so, the opposition managed to defeat the ruling socialist party in the 2015 midterm elections, with most Venezuelans desperate for change.

Much less far gone, but on the autocratic path , are Hungary and Poland, where populist nationalist governments, are stoking the anti-immigrant flames that fuel their popular support. Already in Hungary the government controls most of the media, which has facilitated the spread of pro-government propaganda and bolstered Prime Minister Viktor Orban's election campaigns, utilizing bigotry

The countries I mentioned above have thin democratic traditions.

In countries with strong democratic underpinnings, the courts still function, the opposition still speaks, the media -- despite attacks by the powerful -- can still do their job. And above all, the people have a strong and enormously influential voice.

So, here's the lesson from this dark wave sweeping the world: When a democratic country elects a politician with suspicious tendencies, defenders of democracy cannot sit back and wait for the next election. Sure, elections are the best way to achieve definitive results, when that is still possible.

But when Election Day looms far in the distance, it's important to maintain the pressure, to call out the lies, to counter the propaganda, the corruption, the violation of the country's moral ideals, and the steady erosion of democratic values that have become the calling cards of modern-day autocrats.

64,64,2018-06-21 00:00:00,cnn.com,"CNN is committed to covering gender inequality wherever it occurs in the world. This story is part of As Equals, a year-long series.

Khartoum, Sudan — Amal is 11 years old and seeking a divorce.

The young Sudanese girl was in elementary school when a 38-year-old man asked for her hand in marriage.

Her father accepted the proposal, and Amal (not her real name) was immediately wed.

In Sudan, child marriage has been woven into the fabric of the country's culture, driven by tradition and poverty. More than a third of girls there are married before their 18th birthday, according to a 2017 UNICEF report , and 12% are wed before they reach 15. Under the country's 1991 Personal Status Law of Muslims, children can marry when they reach ""maturity,"" which is only 10 years old. It's the lowest legal age of marriage in Africa.

The recent case of Sudanese teenager Noura Hussein , sentenced to death earlier this year for killing her husband as he tried to rape her, has focused attention on child marriage in Sudan. Now 19, Noura was just 15 when she was forced to marry a man more than twice her age.

An illustration of a man in a doorway.

Pre-teen bride Amal says she was repeatedly abused at the hands of her husband, who smoked cigarettes as he beat her.

In an interview in Khartoum, her father sitting beside her, Amal told CNN that her husband had another wife who lived in the same house with them.

After the abuse, Amal said that she went to her father for help, but he kept sending her back. Eventually she escaped with the aid of her husband's first wife.

""He treated me horribly,"" Amal said of her husband. ""Then when the beatings became every day, I went to the police station.""

A doctor who evaluated Amal's injuries at the station found evidence that she'd been tied up and assaulted.

Though he had heard her story before, Amal's father wept while his daughter talked to us.

""Twice, she came to my home, twice, and was terrified and frightened. I sent her back,"" he told CNN. ""I am regretful.""

Amal's father, who works as a tinsmith laborer in the street, is raising six daughters on his own. When he described why he married Amal off -- despite her young age -- he cited tradition and honor.

""When I let him marry my daughter, it was on trust, on the basis that he would look after her, let her continue with her education and honor her as agreed,"" he said. ""But I found that this was not happening. It was all beating, humiliation and provocation.""

Many Sudanese parents marry off their daughters in hopes of avoiding poverty, violence or family shame. Unmarried women are often stigmatized as agir, ""infertile,"" or bayra, ""not demanded for marriage."" But, in reality, child brides are more likely to face sexual, physical and psychological violence, according to UNICEF.

""I didn't know that getting married at a young age could have such consequences,"" Amal's father added.

Despite what happened to Amal, he says it won't stop him from marrying off his younger daughters.

An illustration of a woman's hand with henna, a Sudanese wedding tradition.

In December 2015, the Sudanese government joined the African Union campaign to end child marriage on the continent. One year later, Sudan received recommendations from the United Nations with the same goal.

In the intervening years, Sudan's National Council for Child Welfare (NCCW) formulated a strategy for abandoning the practice, but the reform sparked counter-mobilization by conservative religious groups in the country and little has been done to implement it.

The SEEMA Center, a nongovernmental organization working with victims and survivors of gender-based violence in Khartoum, is among civil-society groups working to change that.

Nahid Jabralla, director of SEEMA, has been campaigning in support of Amal, Noura and other young women and girls with stories like theirs.

""Many of the cases brought to SEEMA Center are related to forced marriage, child marriage or domestic violence, including marital rape and cases to do with injustice,"" Jabralla told CNN. ""However, what is brought to SEEMA Center is a very small portion of the cases of the violations that women and children are subjected to in the Sudan.""

The Sudanese government has not responded to CNN's requests for comment on child marriage in the country, or Noura's case.

While official statistics show that 34% of girls in Sudan get married before they reach 18, this varies significantly across the country. In Sudan's East Darfur State, for example, 57% of women marry before the age of 18, according to a 2014 UNICEF health survey

Sudan is full of Nouras and few have seen justice, Jabralla says.

Despite these odds, young girls like Amal are still fighting for a different future.

The 11-year-old, who likes to play with dolls and has filled countless notebooks with poetry, is adamant on having her divorce finalized.

As soon as it is, she wants to get back to school, to be reunited with her friends.

Asked what advice she would give other young girls fighting early marriage, Amal looked down at her hands.

""Be brave,"" she said.

""I wish I was braver.""",The 11-year-old girl divorcing her 38-year-old husband,http://cnn.com/2018/06/21/africa/sudan-child-marriage-asequals-intl/index.html
65,65,2018-05-27 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Washington (CNN) For years, comedian Billy Eichner has been known for screaming at people about pop culture on the streets of New York for his show ""Billy on the Street.""

Now, he wants to yell at people about something else: politics.

""I've been shouting about silly things -- actors, Oscars, thing I've always cared about,"" he told CNN in a recent interview. ""But I want to use my voice to shout at people about more significant things.""

Enter Funny or Die -- Will Ferrell and Adam McKay's 11-year-old comedy website that is home to viral videos including Zach Galifianakis' show ""Between Two Ferns"" (which famously had former President Barack Obama on as a guest in 2014). Eichner has a history with the digital comedy brand, which helped launch ""Billy on the Street"" and subsequently elevated his career.

So it came as no surprise in February of this year when the website announced it is partnering with Eichner yet again. This time for ""Glam Up The Midterms,"" an effort to bring awareness to voting in the midterm elections across the country.

""Get ready for the hottest event of the year,"" Eichner says in the promo video. ""No, it's not the Grammys, the Oscars, or the Golden Globes. It's the 2018 midterm elections.""

TONIGHT join me, @JimmyKimmel and many more of your favorites as we GET OUT THE VOTE and GLAM UP THE MIDTERMS! Help us!!! Sign up now and join the party: https://t.co/ahkVPrVrh4 #Oscars pic.twitter.com/1jhGmMYrmC — billy eichner (@billyeichner) March 5, 2018

As November approaches, Eichner's mission is to reach as many people across the US as possible, one event at a time -- with help from celebrities (such as Sarah Silverman, Jimmy Kimmel, John Oliver and Chelsea Handler) and people Eichner described as ""hometown heroes,"" local activists and leaders from across the US.

Funny or Die kicked off its midterms initiative with two events in California: one in April in San Diego, featuring Ron Burgundy, Ferrell's infamous ""Anchorman"" character; and one in May in Los Angeles, at RuPaul's annual ""DragCon.""

The plan is to hit the road this summer, and go to districts with the most competitive races to encourage people from both sides of the aisle to get to the polls.

""I wanted to take something that feels like or sounds like a chore or a test you take in school -- the midterms -- and turn it into people and make it something hot, the sexiest event of the year,"" Eichner said. ""That's a joke, obviously -- but that's our way with having fun of what can be traditionally a very dry, chore-like process.""

Inspired by a tweet

Eichner said he found himself becoming more vocal in the aftermath of the 2016 election.

conan billy eichner game of thrones_00023802.jpg

""As horrendous as I knew Trump would be, what's truly remarkable is that he's somehow worse than I thought,"" Eichner tweeted in March of 2017, one of many of his tweets criticizing the President.

Ironically, it was a tweet from President Donald Trump that inspired Eichner's idea to launch a political initiative.

""I honestly do not recall exactly what tweet it was because there were so many tweets to make you angry,"" Eichner said. ""But in that moment [in the summer of 2017], I called Mike Farah, the CEO of Funny or Die. I said, 'I think we should join forces and do something related to upcoming midterm elections, because all the tweeting and marching is great and nothing really means as much as voting, in terms of trying to get the country back on track.'""

Then the brainstorming began.

Funny or Die's political aspirations

Obama's appearance on ""Between Two Ferns"" in 2014 wasn't the first time Funny or Die had ventured into politics.

In 2008, the site debuted ""Prop 8 -- The Musical,"" starring Jack Black, Neil Patrick Harris, Margaret Cho and others, which poked fun at the California ballot initiative that prohibited gay marriage.

A few years later, in 2013, Funny or Die enlisted the help of Alyssa Milano to make a "" sextape ,"" which was actually a video created to educate the public about chemical attacks happening in Syria.

However, following the viral success of Obama and Galifianakis' interview, it became apparent to executives at Funny or Die that politically geared comedy videos have a place on the internet, and that politicians could benefit from doing this type of content, too.

fod between two ferns obama preview_00001907.jpg

""When that episode of 'Between Two Ferns' came out, it was a huge game changer on both sides. We realized we could be doing this kind of stuff all the time,"" Brad Jenkins, an Obama administration alum who was poached by Funny or Die in 2015, told CNN. ""We could be working with nonprofits, foundations, political campaigns, institutions ... and the best comedy writers in the country.""

Funny or Die hired Jenkins, who served as associate director in the White House Office of Public Engagement, in hopes of building the company's brand in Washington. In 2016, the company also brought on David Litt, one of Obama's speechwriters.

Since then, Funny or Die's small DC operation has worked with people and organizations from both sides of the aisle to brainstorm and produce lighthearted, politically centric videos to promote political engagement.

Jenkins said he and Eichner looked at data to see what types of initiatives could be most helpful around midterms. The verdict? Homing in on younger people, from both sides of the aisle, who are maybe less tuned in to politics.

""We started talking about how no young person votes in midterms. It's really bad,"" Jenkins said. ""But it's a whole new universe right now, and we don't even know who's going to be inspired and fired up to vote. Young people may completely surprise us this cycle and outvote a lot of different demographics. We're going to do everything we can in a strategic way to focus on races that matter and people who have never voted in midterms before.""

""Glam up the Midterms"" also serves as a test for the types of initiatives Funny or Die may want to tackle in 2020, Jenkins said.

Kicking off in California

And of course, grassroots voter outreach operations have long been part of each political cycle. Earlier this year, Women's March organizers launched their own midterms initiative ""Power to the Polls.""

But both Eichner and Jenkins acknowledged they don't want to be atypical Hollywood types who infiltrate small towns and tell voters what they should believe.

And while Eichner himself is not a fan of the Trump administration, he emphasized that ""Glam Up The Midterms,"" like Funny or Die, is nonpartisan.

For its first two events, Funny or Die teamed up with Headcount, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that works to promote participation in democracy by signing people up to vote at large events such as music festivals.

The San Diego event took place at Oceanside High School Performing Arts Center, and featured a conversation about the upcoming primary in California's 49th District, where Republican Rep. Darrell Issa's seat is up for grabs.

""The event we did in Issa's district we brought Will Ferrell there -- but in order to come to event you had to sign up for election alerts and commit to voting in the primary,"" Jenkins said. ""With our little event we had close to 5,000 people to sign up to vote in that primary.""

At DragCon, a three-day drag culture convention, Eichner joined drag queen superstars Alaska 5000 and Peppermint for a panel. More than 50,000 flocked to DragCon this year, according to event organizers.

""RuPauls DragCon is really a three-day celebration of everything we hold dear as Americans,"" RuPaul Charles, the creator behind hit reality TV show ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" and the convention, said in an email interview with CNN. ""And ... if freedom-loving Americans don't get their s--t together, we are all going to be stuck living in a country that doesn't allow all of its citizens their constitutional right to be fierce.""

66,66,2018-06-20 00:00:00,cnn.com,"John McWhorter teaches linguistics, American studies, philosophy and music history at Columbia University and is the author of "" Words on the Move ."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) You know the United States is being run by a gang of idiots when they not only try to use language in nefariously Orwellian fashion, but can't even get that right.

I refer to the idea that children separated abruptly and indefinitely from their parents at the US-Mexico border are being housed in so-called ""tender age facilities."" The purpose of such language is to mask the cruel detention of these bewildered children in internment compounds, done in an effort to penalize their parents for attempting to enter America, some illegally.

The Trump administration's motivation for this quest to euphemize is hardly obscure. The moral horror of tearing small children away from their powerless parents is so patent and chilling that it cuts across all of us, regardless of political stripe or temperament. The very few among us, as in Trump's minions and writerly defenders, who can apparently neither imagine themselves in the position of the children or the parents subjected to such heartless abuse, stand out now as unfeeling and cynical to an almost staggering degree (which is saying a lot given the amorality of the Trumpians thus far). On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order that he said was ""about keeping families together,"" but it's unclear what that will look like.

And historically, euphemization has often been a pragmatic way to step around negative associations many may have with a policy, in a quest to do good while changing minds. In the 1930s, amid the near-pitiless opposition to government payments even to widows, the term ""Aid to Families with Dependent Children"" was an artful one, sidestepping the financial aspect of the matter with the general term ""aid,"" for example. And the term has required constant replacement, as opposition to what some consider merely ""the dole"" settles upon the old term and renders it into a near slur. ""Home relief"" and ""welfare"" were early replacements, today being replaced by ""cash assistance,"" which will surely require renewal before long.

In this example, euphemism served what most would regard as a noble purpose, in helping welfare go down more smoothly with the general populace. Cavils about welfare today are largely about its extent and administration: to most of us, the America in which there was no government-sponsored welfare at all seems backward and harsh.

This kind of euphemism becomes more sinister when applied to matters horrific. Think for instance of the nakedly manipulative use of language in George Orwell's 1949 novel, ""1984,"" and Orwell's observation in the 1946 essay ""Politics and the English Language"" that ""in our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible,"" amid which, ""where there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms.""

Thus a term such as ""tender age"" -- tender traditionally associated with 1) romance and 2) attending to children, and also a word faintly precious, antique, and therefore somewhat distancing us from what is being referred to. The Trumpians' goal is to mask the horror of what they are doing with a terminology smelling of baby powder and strained pears. Here, however, is where we confront the breathtaking obtuseness of this President and anyone working in his service.

JUST WATCHED Clapper: Fine line between civility and brutality Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Clapper: Fine line between civility and brutality 01:14

The sin here is triple-layered. First is the fact that this policy would be allowed at all by people who purportedly harbor the human quality known as conscience. Second is the fact that they would try to paper over what they are doing with a euphemism. One thinks of when slum clearance -- the razing of poor communities and scattering of their residents in order to build highways and commercial centers -- was retitled ""urban renewal."" And then third is that, whereas it usually takes such euphemisms at least a generation to need changing, we have seen ""tender care facility"" become a sick joke within the space of a mere few days.

Here is an administration both nefarious and inept, combining an absence of compassion with a thickness of tongue. One couldn't write it better that this adminstration is the source of a term sounding as if it were ripped straight out of ""1984"" -- "" alternative facts "" -- only to see it, too, deep-sixed by ridicule within hours of its floating by Kellyanne Conway.

There is, just perhaps, a silver lining in all of this. Many fear that the Trump administration is misusing language in ways that will quietly sucker the American public into going along with their punitive, authoritarian agenda. However, it would appear that this administration is so giftless with language -- from ""alternative facts"" through ""covfefe,"" typo-riddled memos, and an inaugural address of index-card length and on to ""tender age facility"" -- that it lacks the rhetorical power to deceive.

68,68,2018-06-04 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Andrew Wright is a law professor who previously served as associate counsel to President Barack Obama in the White House and as staff director of a congressional oversight subcommittee. Follow him on Twitter (@AndyMcCanse). Former Ambassador Norman L. Eisen, a CNN contributor, is a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution and served as President Obama's ""ethics czar"" from 2009-11. The opinions expressed in this commentary are theirs.

(CNN) As former White House lawyers, we have sought to preserve confidential presidential communications and policy deliberations from disclosure. And we believe that executive privilege has a legitimate, albeit limited, role as a shield.

Executive privilege, including the presidential communications privilege, is an assertion of presidential authority to withhold information from a judicial or congressional proceeding in order to preserve executive branch confidentiality interests.

In prior high-profile criminal investigations with White House equities -- like Iran-Contra, Whitewater/Clinton-Lewinsky, the 1996 campaign financing task force and Valerie Plame's blown CIA cover -- presidents and vice presidents have invariably negotiated about interviews and testimony under the shadow of a subpoena threat.

Usually, out of respect for the White House and in return for a voluntary appearance, prosecutors afford the president certain logistical accommodations, including the right to have counsel present (unlike normal grand jury witnesses).

But President Donald Trump has been flirting with a full-blown subpoena fight. So, the privilege arguments here are part of an effort to undermine Mueller's subpoena threat by suggesting he'll lose.

In its letter to Mueller, President Trump's legal team goes to great lengths to explain the nature and purpose of executive privilege as it relates to presidential communications. The memorandum contains the broad assertion with respect to the White House production of information that ""[t]he majority of that information could have been rightfully withheld on multiple privilege grounds, including but not limited to the presidential communications privilege.""

In that sense, the memorandum merely establishes that the White House has so far engaged in the typical negotiated cooperation with respect to documents and testimony by the President's aides.

But it is targeted at the coming court fight: President Trump (and special counsel Mueller) will want to have built a record of reasonable accommodation before a judge rules on a subpoena. Mueller's team will have its own perspective on the level of cooperation it has received as the President and his allies continue to publicly attack the special counsel.

More substantively, the memorandum seeks to leverage the Clinton-era case, In re Sealed Case (Espy), to argue that Mueller has not met a standard of need for President Trump's testimony that would support a valid subpoena.

In Espy, the DC Circuit held that the prosecutor must ""demonstrate with specificity why it is likely that the subpoenaed materials contain important evidence and why this evidence, or equivalent evidence, is not practically available from another source."" Team Trump then makes the case that Mueller's need is lacking.

There are several glaring problems with the Trump executive privilege argument.

First, as a factual matter, the President is a central witness to numerous episodes under investigation. The President's son, son-in-law, campaign chairman, deputy campaign chairman, personal lawyer and four campaign foreign policy advisers (one of whom briefly served as national security adviser and another who became attorney general) have all had Russia connections that have come under scrutiny.

The President's public remarks at various points suggest he may have had more visibility into Russia's efforts to assist his campaign. (For instance, in an interview with The New York Times last fall, the President said (and then denied) that he had advance knowledge of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between senior campaign officials and Russians.)

Once inaugurated, President Trump has manifested public and private hostility to the Russia inquiry.

Obstruction of justice -- both in the criminal statute and Nixon and Clinton articles of impeachment senses -- turns on the president's state of mind. There are several different formulations of federal obstruction of justice, but as a general matter, the prosecution must establish proof of an obstructive act or attempt to influence a reasonably foreseeable and proximate federal proceeding with corrupt intent.

Impeachment for obstruction of justice is governed by less rigid standards, but proof of corrupt intent would likely be necessary to demonstrate that the president has abused his power. Documents and other witnesses' testimony certainly shed light on Trump's state of mind, but they are no substitute for asking the man himself.

Second, the two primary privilege cases that would guide any court reviewing a Mueller subpoena -- Espy and United States v. Nixon -- do not support the Trump legal position.

In Espy, the White House documents at issue related to a White House counsel investigation undertaken at the president's direction to see whether to take administrative action against the secretary of agriculture over allegations that he took bribes or accepted gratuities from parties with business before the Department of Agriculture -- the same issue being investigated by the independent counsel.

Neither President Bill Clinton, nor his White House aides, nor his senior campaign staff were under investigation. It is surprising to see the Trump legal team place so much reliance on a case in which the DC Circuit told the trial court to consider ordering more, not less, White House disclosures.

Even more damaging to the Trump cause, though, is Nixon. There, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Watergate special prosecutor's subpoena for the Nixon tapes. The court recognized that the president is entitled to assert executive privilege, but that it is a qualified privilege. A qualified privilege means that the court will balance interests in confidentiality against the need for information -- it is not a guaranteed winner for the president.

The court took great pains to balance a president's confidentiality interests against the need for ""relevant evidence in a criminal proceeding."" Mueller's need for evidence seems more like Nixon than Espy, and the courts enforced subpoenas served on the White House in both.

Finally, like Trump, Nixon argued that he did not need to comply with the special prosecutor's subpoena because the president sits atop the executive branch, the special prosecutor was his subordinate and this was an ""intra-branch dispute"" not capable of judicial resolution.

The Supreme Court unanimously rejected that argument. While that holding exposes the weakness of President Trump's unitary executive argument, it also undermines his executive privilege argument attacking Mueller's subpoena authority. We are not surprised Nixon was conspicuously absent from the Trump team's memorandum.

The net effect of the facts here and these two cases, Trump will likely lose a court battle over his sweeping position that he cannot be subpoenaed. We believe such a fight is looming. As suggested by Rudy Giuliani's publicity tour, Mueller is still pressing for an interview and evidently willing to subpoena the President if it is not forthcoming.

As he must, the central questions in the investigation cannot otherwise be resolved. When the courts consider the arguments in the Trump lawyer letter, they will likely end up where they belong -- in the dust bin, requiring him to appear and contest the applicability of the privilege to particular questions just like any other litigant.",Trump's executive privilege argument is a loser,http://cnn.com/2018/06/04/opinions/trump-executive-privilege-fail-wright-eisen/index.html

71,71,2018-06-23 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Nick Anderson is a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist who was laid off by the Houston Chronicle in 2017. The views expressed here are solely his.

(CNN) Every once in a great while, American readers experience a rare moment of collective awareness about editorial cartooning -- in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo massacre in France and the Mohammed cartoon controversy in Denmark, for example, when the loss of life and violent demonstrations forced the world to take note.

And now, in a different register, there is the Orwellian firing of Pittsburgh Post-Gazette cartoonist , Rob Rogers, after a 25-year career, for doing cartoons critical of President Trump . Certainly these events are not equivalent, but for a cartoonist like me, they stand out as the events involving my profession that cause America to pause and take notice.

As with so many other outrages, America then usually goes back to sleep and pays little attention to the existential threat to editorial cartooning unfolding under their noses.

A number of Americans are justifiably outraged by Rob's firing (disclosure: we're friends). It's a form of censorship. Rob's firing occurred after what he described to The New York Times as months of pressure from his editor. ""When I had lunch with my new boss a few months ago, he informed me that the paper's publisher believed that the editorial cartoonist was akin to an editorial writer, and that his views should reflect the philosophy of the newspaper,"" according to him.

There were 19 cartoons killed in that span -- six in a single week. Rob went public on Facebook that week after the fourth one -- an image of someone in a Klan outfit asking a doctor, in a reference to Roseanne Barr's attempt to explain her racist tweets, ""Could it be the Ambien?"" -- was killed.

JUST WATCHED Newspaper fires cartoonist critical of Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Newspaper fires cartoonist critical of Trump 02:47

I was actually the first one to comment -- ""That was killed??"" I could see absolutely no rationale for killing that cartoon. Given the context of Roseanne Barr's tweet about Valerie Jarrett - an African-American woman who was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama -- the cartoon showing a KKK member blaming his racism on ""Ambien"" was completely within the bounds of fair commentary.

I called him a few days later to express concern about his job security. Getting a string of cartoons killed is generally not a good harbinger of things to come, and going public with it is a risky gambit. But, there is absolutely no reason to be an editorial cartoonist if you don't have the opportunity to express yourself. That's the whole point of being a cartoonist. His situation was clearly growing intolerable . He was right to go public.

But what's missing from the situation is the outrage for the quiet firing of over 100 cartoonists around the country over the past few decades. The generally accepted number by the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists is that there were about 180 staff cartoonists three decades ago. Now there are fewer than a couple dozen . My state, Texas -- the second-largest in the Union -- doesn't have a single full-time cartoonist

Newspapers get tired of the controversy that a full-time cartoonist can cause. A staff cartoonist is someone who works as a salaried employee, much like a reporter. A syndicated cartoon is distributed to hundreds of papers by a news service. Editors get tired of the complaints from readers. But those firings could easily have been masked as layoffs, especially since syndicated cartoons are far less expensive.

It's harder to kill a cartoon from your staff cartoonist -- like a writer would, they complain. They fight back. They have a voice that they can raise with you in person. It's easier to kill a cartoon from a syndicate. You just quietly discard it in favor of a less controversial cartoon. The power to select content is also the power to stifle content.

So, if you're feeling outraged about Rob Rogers, you're not alone -- the Post-Gazette's union reporters and non-unionized editors took out ads in their own paper distancing themselves from their publisher as a result.

You can do something, too. You can ask yourself this: does your local newspaper even have an editorial cartoonist? If they do, let the editors there know how much you appreciate their work.

If not, ask yourself why not and what those editors might do if they found themselves in the same position as the ones at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Your local paper is likely breathing a sigh of relief. They are currently being spared the PR nightmare that the Post-Gazette is experiencing because your local paper quite likely banished their editorial cartoonist years ago.

American newspapers aren't likely to suddenly reverse course and start hiring cartoonists back, and digital outlets' commitment to cartoons is uneven at best. Generally speaking, publications' propensity for self-reflection is heavily dependent on what their readers demand. Do the web publications you read have cartoonists? If you like editorial cartoons, and if you share them on social media, ask yourself, where they are going to come from in the future? Contact the publications you read and make a suggestion.

75,75,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) The US Food and Drug Administration approved a cannabis-based drug for the first time, the agency said Monday.

Epidiolex was recommended for approval by an advisory committee in April, and the agency had until this week to make a decision.

The twice-daily oral solution is approved for use in patients 2 and older to treat two types of epileptic syndromes: Dravet syndrome, a rare genetic dysfunction of the brain that begins in the first year of life, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a form of epilepsy with multiple types of seizures that begin in early childhood, usually between 3 and 5.

""This is an important medical advance,"" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement Monday. ""Because of the adequate and well-controlled clinical studies that supported this approval, prescribers can have confidence in the drug's uniform strength and consistent delivery.""

The drug is the ""first pharmaceutical formulation of highly-purified, plant-based cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid lacking the high associated with marijuana, and the first in a new category of anti-epileptic drugs,"" according to a statement Monday from GW Pharmaceuticals, the UK-based biopharmaceutical company that makes Epidiolex.

Cannabidiol is one of more than 80 active cannabinoid chemicals, yet unlike tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, it does not produce a high.

The FDA has approved synthetic versions of some cannabinoid chemicals found in the marijuana plant for other purposes, including cancer pain relief.

Justin Gover, chief executive officer of GW Pharmaceuticals, described the approval in the statement as ""a historic milestone."" He added that the drug offers families ""the first and only FDA-approved cannabidiol medicine to treat two severe, childhood-onset epilepsies.""

""These patients deserve and will soon have access to a cannabinoid medicine that has been thoroughly studied in clinical trials, manufactured to assure quality and consistency, and available by prescription under a physician's care,"" Gover said.

Epidiolex will become available in the fall, Gover told CNN. He would not give any information on cost, saying only that it will be discussed with insurance companies and announced later.

With Epidiolex meeting FDA standards, the drug will ""finally be made available to the thousands that may benefit from it,"" he said.

According to the Epilepsy Foundation, up to It's an option for those patients who have not responded to other treatments to control seizures.According to the Epilepsy Foundation, up to one-third of Americans who have epilepsy have found no therapies that will control their seizures.

Shauna Garris, a pharmacist, pharmacy clinical specialist and adjunct assistant professor at the University of North Carolina's Eshelman School of Pharmacy, said the drug is effective and works somewhere between ""fairly"" and ""very well."" She has not used Epidiolex in her own clinical practice and was not involved in the development of the drug but said she's not sure it will live up to ""all of the hype"" that has surrounded it.

There are side effects, the most common being sleepiness, Gover said. But Garris highlighted that many of the side effects occur when it is taken with other medications, which she said is a concern because most patients are on other medications.

There are likely to be drug interactions, she said, but ""that's not uncommon for antiepileptic medications,"" and she noted that this could affect the effectiveness of the medication.

The European Medical Society is also considering approval of Epidiolex and is expected to announce a decision in the first quarter of next year, according to Gover.

A phase three clinical trial is underway for a third seizure-related condition called tuberous sclerosis complex, which begins in infancy and causes a sudden stiffening of the body, arms and legs, with the head bent forward. Glover said that if the results are positive, his company will apply for supplemental approval for this condition.

In the meantime, it is possible that once on the market, Epidiolex could be prescribed for conditions other than the ones it's approved for. This is called off-label use and is a common practice with many medications.

As part of the FDA's review of the medication, the potential for abuse was assessed and found to be low to negative, according to Gover.

Still, this approval comes as the White House is said to be reconsidering federal prohibition of marijuana and as more and more states approve it for recreational and medicinal use.

Scientists have long found that flight attendants get more breast cancer and melanoma. The new study, published Monday in the journal Environmental Health , saw the same trend and detected a higher prevalence of every other cancer the researchers examined: Non-melanoma skin cancer, uterine, gastrointestinal, cervical and thyroid cancers were all seen at a higher rate in flight attendants.

""Something that somewhat surprised us, to some extent, was that we also saw a higher instance of breast cancer in women with three or more children,"" said study co-author Irina Mordukhovich, a research associate at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Typically, the more children a woman has, the lower her risk of breast cancer. A previous study showed a result similar to the new breast cancer finding , she said, but Mordukhovich didn't expect those findings would be replicated.

""Women with three or more children are already probably not getting enough sleep,"" Mordukhovich said. ""Combine that with this disruption from the job, especially for those who fly internationally, this may be an indication that the circadian rhythm disruption is having an impact.""

Disruptions in circadian rhythm -- a person's daily sleep-wake cycle -- are linked to an increased cancer risk, studies have shown.

of the flight attendants in the study were women, as would be expected, the authors said, in a ""feminized"" occupation. The new study compared data on self-reported cancer cases in the Harvard Flight Attendant Health Study , which collects data to help people understand how their job can affect health, with cases tracked in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , an ongoing study that tracks the health and nutrition of adults and children in the general population. Eighty percentof the flight attendants in the study were women, as would be expected, the authors said, in a ""feminized"" occupation.

The research does not answer why flight attendants report higher cancer numbers, but the authors have some ideas, based on earlier research.

Steve Fiering , a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, said it's hard to argue with the idea behind the study.

Fiering, who was not involved in the study but conducts research on flight attendants, said he found the higher rates of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer among women in the study ""striking"" -- ""especially to see a close to four-fold increase in non-melanoma skin cancer; that is substantial,"" he said.

If you fly a lot, should you worry about your own cancer risk? Mordukhovich said there isn't a lot of research on frequent fliers, although logic suggests that they face similar exposures.

Mordukhovich said she and her colleagues were motivated to study flight attendants because there are gaps in the research on them, and that could mean gaps in the policies meant to protect them on the job, at least in the United States.

(CNN) It has been just a few months since Mark Zuckerberg was dragged before Congress to answer for his company, but Facebook has been put in the hot seat again — and is falling for a faux scandal cooked up by conservatives.

Amid a new round of unsubstantiated claims of anti-conservative bias from a group of conservative leaders, Facebook launched a review of its practices in May. But instead of relying on a neutral third party, it enlisted former Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl to lead the review, along with the conservative Heritage Foundation.

So not only did Facebook legitimize unfounded claims by launching this new review, but with the selection of Kyl and Heritage, it all but guaranteed that the review will conclude that Facebook has anti-conservative bias. This in turn will put more pressure on Facebook to adopt the group's recommended policy changes.

Despite this, Republican leaders weren't satisfied. Shortly after Facebook launched the review, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and Brad Parscale, campaign manager for Donald Trump's re-election campaign, doubled down on the bias narrative, writing to Twitter and Facebook to complain of ""suppression of conservative speech"" and ""rampant political bias"" on the platforms.

JUST WATCHED Is Facebook censoring conservative news? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Is Facebook censoring conservative news? 03:05

But instead of pointing to the ongoing formal review and letting it run its course, Facebook intensified its efforts to mollify right-wing critics. It arranged a meeting earlier this month between senior Facebook executives and McDaniel, Parscale, and Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.

This reflexive rolling over is alarming and portends a future where Facebook does not just tolerate political strong-arming of its platform, but enables it. Facebook users must let the company know in no uncertain terms that they object.

First, the cries of anti-conservative bias are demonstrably false.

According to a 2017 Newswhip analysis , every measurable indicator reveals that there simply is no anti-conservative bias against publishers in Facebook's algorithm. Most notably, conservative publishers received 2.5 times the engagement of liberal publishers on Facebook.

And according to data Newswhip recently compiled for Neiman Lab, Facebook's algorithm changes -- made early this year to prioritize information shared by family and friends, rather than brands and publishers -- haven't negatively affected hyperpartisan publishers.

Facebook recently rolled out some additional changes as part of its ongoing efforts to combat fake news and hate speech. But a review of Media Matters' internal data, which looked at engagement on Facebook enjoyed by major progressive and conservative Facebook pages since those changes, yields similar findings to Newswhip's 2017 analysis.

Most measurable indicators that we can access, such as Newswhip's report, show that conservatives actually have a significant advantage on Facebook, not the opposite, as is being claimed.

If a modest, nonprofit organization like Media Matters has this data and the ability to analyze it, then Facebook definitely has it. Accordingly, Facebook's continued capitulation to the unfounded claims of conservatives means that either it is willfully ignoring its own data out of fear of right-wing critics or it just hasn't even bothered to look and is taking actions totally disconnected from facts and data. This last seems unlikely.

Second, Facebook has already fallen for this gambit before -- and it had devastating consequences.

In May 2016, a report on Gizmodo claimed that, according to unnamed former employees, Facebook's ""news curators"" conspired to suppress conservative news from the platform's Trending Topics section. Conservatives cried censorship and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg swiftly met with right-wing politicians and pundits including Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson, Glenn Beck and even a representative from the Trump campaign.

After the meeting, Zuckerberg caved to right-wing critics and implemented dramatic policy changes. He fired the contractors who worked as editors of the Trending Topics section and replaced them a few months later with an algorithm that greatly contributed to the fake news problem by regularly putting misinformation in user's newsfeeds. Notably and similarly to the present circumstances, Facebook appeared to act without regard to whether right-wing critics' claims were even accurate.

What's more, after the Gizmodo allegations, Facebook's own internal investigation that same month had analyzed the data and found ""no evidence of systematic political bias"" in the trending topics. Yet Facebook proceeded.

And here we are again, with Facebook jumping to the demands of conservatives — and just ahead of the midterm elections.

Cries of liberal bias by right-wingers too often causes mainstream media outlets to overcompensate and provide disproportionate coverage to conservative viewpoints. It's a playbook that the conservatives have been using against the news media for decades and now they're deploying it against social media companies. Their aim is clear: game the refs and rig the system in their own favor.

Facebook's enabling of this happened in plain sight in the 2016 Gizmodo-caused debacle, which ultimately allowed for the prioritization of fake news on the site. There were plenty of alarms. But no one knew that the sounds they were hearing were alarm bells. Now we all know.

He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky. Follow him on Twitter @ScottJenningsKY . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) Two dumb things happened in the last several days: The Trump administration separated children from their parents as they, many of them illegally, crossed the border into the United States, and the American left assumed that the subsequent outcry over this decision would fundamentally alter the political landscape.

This flap over family detention has again laid bare a debate that worked in Trump's favor in 2016 and could still help him and the Republican Party win in 2018 and 2020: One party prefers tighter immigration restrictions and one party leans toward relaxed enforcement. Trump himself made that case in a speech in Las Vegas over the weekend, when he cited in fiery terms Democrats' desire for ""open borders"" on a campaign swing designed to boost the fortunes of incumbent Republican Dean Heller.

Democrats are likely to be disappointed when they poll this issue. My guess is that a majority of Americans will feel the same about Trump before and after, and some may even like him more. The bottom is not going to fall out of this presidency over Trump taking a position that conforms with his hardline anti-immigration stance. I imagine a negligible number of Trump supporters will abandon their support for him over this misguided policy.

Regarding what to do with the immigrant families once they are detained, Democrats should not assume wide support for the position taken by Sen. Kamala Harris of California -- essentially, release them inside the United States pending a hearing. While most polling shows that Americans view legal immigration as a positive thing for the United States, a sizable portion of Americans would likely prefer to keep the families together before deporting them to their country of origin -- as opposed to releasing them inside the United States. Most voters welcome people coming here legally, but believe illegal immigration is a serious problem.

Being candid about Trump's decision to engage in a policy leading to family separation, surely the White House wishes it could have that one back. The President wound up reversing course via executive order after days of painful images and audio recordings created a public outcry. Shifting explanations from various administration officials made the position untenable, and the President smartly put an end to it last Wednesday, although Trump can take solace in former Department of Homeland Security Director Jeh Johnson's admission on Fox News on Sunday that the Obama administration did, in fact, detain some children alone.

As for the Democrats, they couldn't take yes for an answer. After clamoring for the President to end his administration's policy, they moved the goalposts as soon as he did. What started as a demand to stop separating families has morphed into a call to stop detaining the families altogether.

Harris, a possible 2020 presidential candidate tweeted that ""Indefinitely detaining children with their families in camps is inhumane and will not make us safe."" In other words, she wants the families caught and released into the United States. She went further , asking other senators to support her ""DONE Act to prohibit the expansion or construction of new detention facilities.""

Where are we supposed to put the people caught illegally passing into the United States if we don't have enough detention facilities? The answer, of course, is nowhere. Harris doesn't seem to want them detained at all.

While President Trump was wrong to move to the harsh penalty of separating children from their families, Democrats are playing with fire by putting catch-and-release at the top of their agenda. Americans clearly believe we need stronger borders, even as they prefer the families be kept together before being shipped home.

Left-wing political and media figures are playing into the President's hand by trying to delegitimize his concerns about criminals crossing our borders. On ""CNN Tonight"" last week, responding to a point I made about the President's preference that we stop violent criminals at the border, New York Times columnist Charles Blow said : ""We wouldn't have a country if it wasn't flooded with criminals in the very beginning.""

While Blow isn't wrong that some criminals were sent here from England in the 1700s (before we were an independent nation, by the way), I'd like to see a congressional candidate use that as a rationale for a position of catch-and-release in the fall election. Good luck!

Beyond that, whatever Trump's family separation position cost the Republican Party politically has more than been erased by hysterical comments like those from Democrats like Rep. Maxine Waters, who called for the public to ""create a crowd"" to ""push back on"" Trump administration officials. She included a startling call to action : ""If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. You push back on them. Tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere!"" Her remarks followed incidents of harassment targeted at Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi , who were run out of public places.

Americans across the political spectrum can have reasonable — even fierce — policy disagreements, but calling for angry mobs to hound political enemies will strike most Americans as dangerous. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi referred to Waters' comments in a tweet as ""unacceptable,"" but also blamed Trump's ""lack of civility"" as a provoking factor. The fact is that voters may not want to trust control of the government to people who believe in mob justice over civil discourse.

But while the outcry over immigration policy isn't likely to doom the GOP's chances at winning, Republicans still have work to do.

More optimistic rhetoric and party unity would be helpful. Imagine if congressional Republicans could unify around legislation that did it all — secured the borders, saved the Dreamers, unified families and reformed a broken system. GOP unity would force the Senate Democrats to provide 10 votes for a big fix or face backlash for obstructionism. Alas, the GOP currently remains fractured on broad solutions.

I would also advise Republicans to embrace the reason immigrants are coming here: We have a country that is worth the risk. As long as we have more jobs than people to fill them ( we do ), and as long as America is safer than the violent villages of Central America ( it is ), we can expect people to continue to risk it all to come to the United States.

This is not a bad thing. It means that under President Trump and the Republicans, our economy is red hot and America remains the envy of the world. Republicans can embrace this positive condition while still preferring stronger borders and a reformed immigration system that keeps the criminals out.

What happens next? The most likely outcome is a narrow congressional fix on the family separation issue, while the remaining immigration problems remain, sadly, unresolved. Meanwhile, the President will continue to make his case for tougher border enforcement, and the Democrats will go down the catch-and-release rabbit hole.

(CNN) Imagine an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official telling an undocumented immigrant mother waiting to request asylum that he is going to take her child to bathe or to get something to eat.

Imagine a mother requesting to comfort her screaming child as he is removed from her arms, only to have a Border Patrol agent laugh in her face.

Peter Hirschman, a volunteer at Keep Tucson Together , an organization run by community members who support immigration cases, says he was told about these situations. They have resulted from the Trump administration's zero-tolerance immigration policy that calls for the prosecution of all individuals who illegally enter the United States. Although there is no law mandating the separation of families, when adults are prosecuted, they enter the criminal justice system, while their children are processed via the Office of Refugee Resettlement.

The Trump administration's latest tactic is part of a long-fought campaign to dehumanize immigrants, particularly women who are mothers and victims of domestic violence . Aside from being wrong, Trump's policies and treatment of immigrants are fundamentally un-American. America is a country formed by immigrants who have historically welcomed, with a number of exceptions, those from other nations in their greatest time of need. In turning our backs on that noble tradition, the Trump administration is creating a humanitarian crisis.

But it's important to remember that even before taking office, Trump used his campaign rallies as a testing ground for language dehumanizing immigrants. Remember when he declared his candidacy and called Mexicans drug dealers and rapists?

Then, in his first month in office, Trump signed executive orders to begin construction on the border wall, create broader criteria for deportations and remove federal funding for sanctuary cities. In April of this year, Trump vowed that the migrant caravan moving through Mexico toward the United States ""better be stopped.""

Trump's rhetoric is particularly troubling when you consider that families requesting asylum are often fleeing extreme violence in their home countries. In practice, US policy has been, with a few exceptions , to keep families together as they go through a process that could take on average six months . But under the new policy, all bets are off. Mothers can be separated from their children. And, in some cases, the mothers may also be victims of sexual harassment or abuse, as is documented in complaints filed against ICE.

In the case of one migrant I accompanied from El Salvador to Mexico in August 2017, she was held in a detention center in California for eight months before receiving asylum, a period during which she alleges she experienced violence at the detention center.

And while this woman may have been traveling alone, many migrants make the dangerous journey as families. When parents arrive at the border and are separated from their children, the children are sent to shelters, military bases , foster homes, or perhaps soon, if the Trump administration has its way, tent cities

In Tucson, as in many other border cities, the shelters for children are full, according to Hirschman, so there is little chance parents will be detained even in the same state as their children. Unaccompanied minors can't make the decision to return to their home country on their own, so they are stuck in limbo, often with no idea where their parents are. According to Hirschman, ""This kind of trauma is lifelong for kids.""

I am reminded of Ludin Gómez , 31, a single mother traveling with her three children: Daniela, 8, Isaac, 9, and María José, 12. I met her at a migrant shelter in Tapachula, Mexico, in June 2017, and she planned on making her way to the United States, and thanked God for having helped her survive while traveling alone with three kids. Gómez, who was from Santa Rosa de Copán, Honduras, had a first-grade education and couldn't afford to both feed her kids and send them to school, so she decided to migrate to the United States. I wonder how she and her children were treated when they reached the US-Mexico border, if those three young faces that looked up at me smiling and curious about life in the United States were pulled from the arms of their mother.

(CNN) In a decision with potentially enormous consequences, the US Supreme Court ruled Thursday that states have the right to charge sales tax on online transactions by out-of-state companies with no physical presence in their territory.

For those who buy do all their online buying on Amazon -- which, after its acquisition of Whole Foods, has a ""physical presence"" in pretty much every state, and which already collects sales tax in all 45 states that have such a tax -- this may have a limited impact. But for everyone else, this means paying more out of pocket.

And if you are one of the millions of Americans who sell goods via platforms like eBay and Etsy, it means having to collect and remit sales taxes in a mind-bending array of seller-buyer combinations. As the ruling points out, there are well over 10,000 state, city and local sales-tax jurisdictions in the country, and the responsibility for figuring out how much tax to collect and where to send it ultimately will rest on sellers.

That could put a significant chill on the peer-to-peer e-commerce economy, although the plaintiff in the case, South Dakota, exempts sellers who earn less than $100,000 or conduct fewer than 200 transactions a year. But each state will likely have its own unique set of exemptions, and it's hard to imagine even dedicated crafters and mom and pop e-tailers grinding their way through that menacing regulatory jungle to stay on the right side of the law.

The states argue that they're losing big bucks due to the unique tax break provided to online vendors -- as much as $33 billion a year , according to their estimates. And bricks-and-mortar stores, who are subject to taxes every time they ring up a charge on the register, have also lobbied for a level tax playing field.

But the original argument for exempting out of state online vendors from taxation, as decided by the Supreme Court 26 years ago in the case of Quill Corp v. North Dakota , was something known as the ""Dormant Commerce Clause"" -- which holds that without a federal law holding otherwise, state laws that encourage in-state transactions over cross-state ones should be struck down, because they inhibit free and open interstate commerce.

That's even truer today, as the number of tax jurisdictions and unique local regulations have continued to multiply. And while the plaintiffs in this case have argued that sophisticated software can manage the tracking and remittance of taxes on behalf of small vendors, that software is likely to be easily accessible only to the major online platforms -- that is to say, the likes of Amazon (which has already begun gearing up to provide ""taxation as a service"" to its Marketplace sellers) and eBay, companies valued at $150 billion and $67 billion.

But individual vendors who'd prefer to not be dependent on the whims and tyrannies of bigger enterprises are out of luck.

The court's concurring and dissenting lineups reflect the weird tensions and conflicting priorities inherent in the case: The majority included Justices Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg — consistently the most progressive member of the court — alongside hard-conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch. Meanwhile, Chief Justice John Roberts dissented, in tandem with liberal jurists Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. According to the always essential SCOTUSblog , this is a lineup that hasn't yet been seen in the history of this court.

I'm as divided in my own opinion as the court was. On the one hand, it's unquestionably unfair to privilege out-of-state vendors over those in your region or community. Small bricks and mortar businesses are embattled enough in the age of e-commerce. On the other, the ruling raises an endless series of complicated questions. Sales tax isn't just charged on physical products, after all, but also on digital goods, services and labor.

In 2015, I spent several months in California, while continuing to write for New York-based editors, like the ones here at CNN. The following year, I moved to L.A. -- for good, it seems -- but I never thought that my brief stay the prior year might expose me to business taxes in the state, since I hadn't changed my residency then and I wasn't earning money from writing for California-based platforms.

I recently received a surprising and unpleasant notice that simply having a mailing address in California for a few months might have been enough to qualify my one-many professional services company as a ""California company"" for 2015 state tax purposes.

While my issue was business income taxes and not sales taxes, and the issue has since been resolved, the confusion underscored the immense difficulty of determining ""presence"" in a digital economy.

And if I move to yet another state, sales tax issues might yet be in my future, given this new ruling.

Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook

As business grows increasingly mobile, and more blurry in origin and fluidly interconnected, physical location is a less and less feasible way to track where and how transactions are made. If I sell something in New York, but I use a website whose server is in Oregon, receive payment in cryptocurrency (on a blockchain located, essentially, everywhere), and have the actual product shipped from China to a buyer in Iowa, what states deserve a piece of the sales tax pie?

What about emerging digital platforms like Twitch -- which allows gamers to stream their play and get tipped in real cash by viewers from across the nation and all over the world? Are they ""selling a service"" or ""receiving gifts""? Should they pay sales taxes as well?

84,84,2018-05-02 00:00:00,cnn.com,"In an interview with the Boston Globe on Tuesday, the California Democrat, who has led her party in the House for the last 15 years, said of the 2018 midterm election and her future: ""We will win. I will run for speaker. I feel confident about it. And my members do, too.""

That announcement was greeted with a mixture of joy and disappointment within the Democratic Party. Republicans, on the other hand, were positively gleeful at the prospect of having the unpopular Pelosi to run against this November -- and maybe more Novembers to come.

That reaction typifies the double-edged sword that Pelosi has become for Democrats. She is, without question, the party's best fundraiser and a hero among liberals in and out of Congress. Given those twin strengths, it is virtually impossible for Pelosi to be beaten in an intraparty vote.

At the same time, Pelosi -- thanks to years of sustained attacks from Republicans -- is an unpopular figure in many key districts Democrats need to win the majority this fall. In an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll in March, just 21% had a positive view of Pelosi as compared to 43% who saw her in a negative light.

In recent years, as Democrats have failed to recapture the majority they lost in 2010, more and more rank-and-file Democrats have broken away from Pelosi -- calling for younger (and just plain different) leadership (Pelosi is 78 years old).

In the leadership vote following the 2016 election, nearly one third of the Democratic caucus voted for someone other than Pelosi -- the most opposition she has ever faced. At the same time, the fact that it was a story that Pelosi only won with two-thirds of her caucus speaks to how strong her standing among her peers remains.

""It's always easy to say you want a change in leadership,"" former New York Rep. Steve Israel told me. ""But change requires forethought. Who can raise the hundreds of millions that she can? Who can keep the caucus together as she has? Who can secure the legislative victories she's secured? Sometimes, you don't know what you got until they're gone.""

There is no question that Pelosi's fundraising ability cannot be immediately replaced -- and that Democrats might struggle for years to replace it. Pelosi raised more than $16 million in the first three months of 2018, with the vast majority of that total -- $15.4 million -- going directly to the party's campaign arm. Pelosi's office puts her total fundraising since she became a member of the Democratic leadership in 2002 at just south of $660 million. That's a staggering sum for any elected official.

And, the Democratic bench to replace Pelosi is very, very thin. Aside from New York Rep. Joe Crowley, who has been waiting in the wings for years and is increasingly open about his ambitions , there simply are not a large chunk of potential Pelosi successors.

Much of that has to do with Pelosi's longevity. People like Steny Hoyer of Maryland or Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, the second and third ranking Democrats in the House, are simply too old to offer themselves as fresh faces in a post-Pelosi era (Hoyer is also 78 years old; Clyburn is 77). Other rising stars within the party -- Israel, Xavier Becerra of California, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida -- have either moved up to the Senate, left Washington for other politics jobs, retired or seen their careers blow up.

All of that makes for a major leadership vacuum if and when Pelosi leaves. She knows that. And she also knows that there is just no math in the Democratic caucus by which she doesn't secure a majority of the votes -- no matter what happens on election day 2018.

The truth is -- and this has been a fact for quite some time now -- there is no one who would stand a chance against her in a leadership election. That reality doesn't preclude the fact that she is increasingly an anchor around the necks of candidates running in politically marginal areas. But, for all of the chatter from Democratic candidates and elected officials about how it's time for Pelosi to go, all of them will admit they can't make it happen.

Instead, Chief Justice John Roberts sent the question back to the lower courts to allow for further consideration.

In November, there are 36 gubernatorial races on the ballot -- 26 of which states are currently controlled by Republicans including massive (and massively important) battleground states like Florida and Ohio. Win in November, and you are in office through (at least) 2022.

In virtually all of those states, the governor has a vote -- or a veto -- on whatever map the state legislature produces following the next census in 2020 and the redistricting of the country's congressional (and state legislative) lines that follows. Currently, Republicans have total control -- governor's mansion and both chambers of the state legislature -- in 25 of the 50 states, according to statistics maintained by the National Conference of State Legislators . Democrats have total control in just seven. Another 17 are split control, with one party in control of the governorship and the other with a majority in at least one of the state legislative bodies.

87,87,2018-02-13 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Peter van Onselen is a professor of politics and foundation chair of Journalism at the University of Western Australia and the Contributing Editor at The Australian. The opinions expressed here are solely his.

(CNN) Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce is perhaps best known for the Pistol and Boo affair -- when he threatened actor Johnny Depp with perjury over bringing his dogs into the country illegally.

But it's a very different type of affair which is now engulfing the Deputy PM and leader of the Nationals Party.

Joyce announced the break up of his marriage late last year, and just last week it was revealed that he's living with a former staffer who is expecting his child in April.

Rumors of an affair and a pregnancy were circulating last December when Joyce was forced to contest his own seat after breaching rules which bar foreign nationals from serving in parliament.

Last week, Sydney tabloid The Daily Telegraph ran a page one photo of Joyce's pregnant new partner, Vikki Campion, sparking a nationwide debate about whether or not politicians' private lives should be public business.

Unlike many other countries, the Australian media has largely shied away from reporting on the private lives of its politicians.

The Joyce affair has led to other accusations of inappropriate dealings by the deputy PM, which so far have been strongly denied.

Of more concern for Joyce's political survival is the timing of when his now partner worked for him as well as other senior members of the government. Arguably even though their relationship was consensual, it was a fiduciary relationship between a boss and a subordinate.

This was raised in the first major television interview Joyce did after the revelations of the affair. The US House of Representatives is moving to disallow such personal relationships, although there is no indication similar rules will be adopted in Australia.

There are rules when it comes to ""partners"" of members of parliament working in other MPs offices, which is what Campion went on to do after leaving Joyce's office in April last year. First she was moved into the office of another Nationals cabinet minister, Matt Canavan, who was himself caught up in the citizenship saga, before being shifted into the office of the Nationals chief whip, Damien Drum.

Such appointments require Prime Ministerial approval, which was not given. The government is justifying what many regard as a breach of its own ministerial code of conduct on the grounds that Campion was not yet technically Joyce's partner, which most journalists are reporting as ""not passing the pub test.""

The front page of tomorrow's The Daily Telegraph pic.twitter.com/Rj32KbQiVl — Anthony De Ceglie (@AnthDeCeglie) February 12, 2018

Further, the role of the chief whip is to ensure MPs don't miss parliamentary votes, making it a functional internal position. Campion was a senior media adviser, and she became the second media adviser in Drum's office. A whip hardly needs one media adviser much less two.

Hypocritical?

Joyce's private dealings have received more attention than might be the case for other high profile politicians because of his strong conservative values and rhetoric over the years.

He opposed the recent same sex marriage laws when they were being publicly debated on the grounds that traditional marriage was too important and needed protecting. Critics say that his personal life is therefore fair game when he violates his own statements on values and the sanctity of marriage.

The word ""hypocrite"" has been widely used to describe Joyce, a concerning political label for the leader of a party that has strong support in rural areas -- deeply conservative parts of the nation. It remains to be seen how the Nationals heartland will react to the Joyce revelations.

It's hard to predict if Joyce can survive this scandal. If he survives the parliamentary week, next week he will be the acting Prime Minister with Malcolm Turnbull heading to the US to meet President Donald Trump.

Certainly if there are any new revelations, Joyce's position would become untenable. Even if he does survive, he is now an unwanted distraction for a government already struggling in the polls.

When the Coalition scraped back into power in 2016, it was the junior partner, The Nationals, led by Joyce, that saved the Turnbull government. The Nationals retained all of their seats and netted one more as the senior Coalition partner, the Liberal Party, lost more than a dozen.

Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull (L) and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce (R) address the media during a press conference in Sydney on July 5, 2016.

Since that time, however, Joyce's party has become increasingly divided, meaning that this scandal is providing ammunition for his internal opponents. In their 90-year history the Nationals have only removed one leader in a party room coup, but they have never faced a scandal as big as this.

The global #MeToo campaign has put more attention on the actions of men in positions of power. While Joyce and his staffer were engaged in a consensual relationship, at the corporate level in Australia senior executives have lost their jobs for similarly consensual relationships in the workplace with subordinates.",Affair with ex-staffer could cost Australian Deputy PM his job,http://cnn.com/2018/02/13/opinions/australia-politics-joyce-intl/index.html
88,88,2018-05-31 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Lima, Peru (CNN) As part of his medical training, Dr. Ricardo Pun-Chong spent time doing rounds in hospitals throughout Lima, the capital of Peru.

Day after day, he noticed families sleeping on the floors.

Many of them, he learned, had come from faraway villages, with little or no money, to get medical treatment for their children.

Navigating the country's difficult terrain -- which spans the Andes Mountains to the Amazon -- often means traversing unpaved roads and can make for a dangerous trip.

""The journey, it's very difficult,"" Pun-Chong said. ""People have to cross the mountains or take a boat to cross the river. It can take many days. Just imagine having this trip with a kid with cancer.""

Far from home and loved ones, and unable to pay for a place to stay in Lima, many families found themselves homeless while fighting for their children's lives.

""I couldn't get the picture of the families sleeping on the floor out of my mind,"" Pun-Chong said. ""So, I decided to do something for them.""

Since 2008, Pun-Chong's nonprofit, Inspira , has provided free housing, meals and overall support for sick children and their families while they undergo treatment. The organization has helped more than 900 families who've come from all over Peru.

Pun-Chong, who lives a few blocks from the shelter and is there almost every day, runs the organization with the help of a small staff and an army of passionate volunteers. He spends every holiday with the families there.

""The kids inspire me every day,"" Pun-Chong said. ""When I'm with these kids, and I feel how strong they are, I understand that there are no problems that we can't resolve.""

CNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Pun-Chong about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: What are some of the obstacles facing these families?

Ricardo Pun-Chong: We have people who come from the Amazon, travel on a boat and from there take a bus. And you're with a sick child, with a fever. Once they reach the city, they don't have any resources. Sometimes they don't even speak Spanish; they speak Quechua, Aymara or other dialects.

For leukemia, the most frequent cancer in kids, the first treatment is about six months. But to stay here is too expensive. Sometimes families, they have to sell everything they have. They feel helpless. They feel really alone. They either have to make it work and stay, or they make the difficult trip back home without their children receiving full treatment.

CNN: What kind of environment have you created at the shelter?

Pun-Chong: The shelter is a very special place. We not only wanted people to have a place to sleep and food to eat, we also wanted to create a space to help the kids be cured. It's a place with a lot of love.

I don't want it to feel like a house, I want it to feel like a home. In the shelter we don't have TV because I prefer to talk to the kids and teach them how to create things. I want them to use their imagination.

The families can stay in our shelter as long as they need, and I want them to know they are not alone, there are a lot of people that are with them.

CNN: What is the unique approach you take with the children?

Pun-Chong: Here we live the day-to-day, but we don't talk about tumors and surgeries and cancer. When I go to the shelter, I leave my stethoscope at home. I come in here as Ricardo, not as a doctor. I want each and every one of them to feel special. I try to lift the spirits of these kids who probably have just undergone surgery. I play and have fun with them and make sure that during this hard time, these kids get to just act like kids.

We are doing everything we can to connect and engage with them. We listen to stories, color, paint, play in the park, ride bicycles. We try to give these kids special things and special experiences. I try to make them laugh, to enjoy themselves. I want these kids to play, to learn, to share. I want to help them to be the happiest they can be.

The kickoff game between Saudi Arabia and Russia was a case in point: Putin played host to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ahead of the first match on June 14.

Follow him on Twitter: @julianzelizer . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) When President Trump takes unimaginable steps like separating little children from their families to prove a point about how tough he is willing to be on the borders, there is a natural inclination for Democrats to predict that he finally took a step too far. He finally did something that would break the camel's back, he has given the nation a reason to believe he is not fit to serve.

But before Democrats assume that the crisis on the border will bring this President down, they might want to take a look at the recent poll numbers from Gallup . Despite everything that has happened over the last year and a half, the findings show that the President is not quite as weak as some of his opponents are hoping. Last week his job approval rating averaged 45%, the highest that it has been since his first week in office and, this week, slipped slightly to 41%.

Indeed, his job approval ratings have remained in the 40s since mid-April when unemployment rates plummeted to historically low levels . Just as notable is the political breakdown of his rating, with a 38% approval among Independents and 87% among Republicans. If one adds a grade curve to these numbers, it's clear that outside of the Democratic Party, his approval is holding steady.

His rating now is similar to Jimmy Carter (42%), Ronald Reagan (44%), Bill Clinton (44%) and Barack Obama (47%) in June of their second years. The good news for Democrats is that all four of those presidents experienced difficult midterm elections. In 1978, the conservative coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats cut into the size of Carter's Democratic majority, with the emergence of new firebrands like Newt Gingrich of Georgia who were determined to cause the President problems.

Four years later, the Gipper lamented as House Democrats increased their majority by 26 seats , with most of the gains being liberal Democrats. And of course, Clinton saw Republicans regain control of Congress in 1994 and Obama watched as the GOP took over the House in 2010. None of this bodes well in 2018 for the Republicans, who are likely staring at a difficult midterm.

But the 2020 outlook, the one that really matters to President Trump -- who, we must remember, is not particularly interested in legislation anyway -- is a bit brighter. While Carter ended as a one-term president, Reagan, Clinton, and Obama all went on to be reelected and ended their presidency with strong approval ratings. They are presidents who are often seen by significant swaths of the public as successful and even transformative.

There are a number of factors clearly behind the job approval numbers for President Trump. With an unemployment rate of 3.8% as of last month, everyone in the administration will be feeling pretty good if it's true that voters pick presidents based on the health of their wallets.

The overall state of the stock market doesn't hurt matters either. For all the eye rolls and shoulder shrugs, along with the occasional statement by a Republican that things are not right in Washington, the numbers reveal that his partisan support remains very strong. This is why so few Republican politicians are running away from the President and his decisions, while more and more are embracing his leadership. Notwithstanding the horrific stories of children detained in warehouse-like facilities, a good portion of the public supports President Trump.

The message for Democrats should be clear. The political battle to come in the next few months is going to be fierce. The party is going to need to put together an awesome electoral mobilization, with exciting candidates and big ideas, a first-rate ground game, a strong-fund raising strategy, and a sophisticated plan for the media if they are going to do that one thing that would be guaranteed to bring the era of Trump to an end: defeat him in the 2020 election.

91,91,2018-01-31 00:00:00,cnn.com,"This essay is part of a column called The Wisdom Project by David Allan, editorial director of CNN Health and Wellness. The series is on applying to one's life the wisdom and philosophy found everywhere, from ancient texts to pop culture. You can follow David at @davidgallan . Don't miss another Wisdom Project column; subscribe here .

(CNN) Every January for the past 20 years, I have taken a few moments to ponder the answer to the question ""what is the meaning of life?""

It's one of those enormous questions that's so important -- philosophically and practically in terms of how we live our lives -- and yet we never stop to really think about the answer. Given that you might be able to formulate your response in less than a minute, the wisdom-to-effort ratio for this philosophical exercise could not be more advantageous.

This simple exercise might even help you live longer. According to two separate studies published in 2014 -- one among 9,000 participants over age 65 and another among 6,000 people between 20 and 75 -- those who could articulate the meaning and purpose of their lives died later than those who saw their lives as aimless. It didn't seem to matter what meaning participants ascribed to their life, whether it was personal (like happiness), creative (like making art) or altruistic (like making the world a better place). It was having an answer to the question that mattered.

The connection to longevity could be causal (having purpose may help one cope with daily stress , as other research has shown), but it could also be that those who think about life's meaning are more likely to do other activities that promote good health.

The reason I ask this question year after year is because my answer changes over time, which I find interesting and insightful. There is no objectively correct answer, I believe, only answers that are right for you at any given time.

Great thinkers (and celebrities) have given the question thought, so you can look to the words attributed to them for inspiration. Aristotle, the Greek philosopher who lived 2,500 years ago, is believed to have written that the essence of life is ""to serve others and to do good,"" and the Roman philosopher Cicero, born 280 years later, came to the same conclusion. As did Russian author Leo Tolstoy, who wrote, ""The sole meaning of life is to serve humanity."" And His Holiness the Dalai Lama added, ""if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them.""

Scottish rugby legend Nelson Henderson put the same notion poetically when he said, ""The true meaning of life is to plant trees, under whose shade you do not expect to sit."" And actress Whoopi Goldberg's meaning-of-life metaphor was to ""throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.""

""Love"" was the conclusion of Trappist monk and writer Thomas Merton, and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" actress Julie Benz. Alternatively, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger concluded, ""The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer.""

My favorite answer, though, is the Zen-like circular reasoning attributed to writer Robert Byrne, who put it, ""The purpose of life is a life of purpose.""

Some have concluded that life's meaning is subjective. ""There is not one big cosmic meaning for all,"" Anaïs Nin wrote in her diary. ""There is only the meaning we each give to our life, an individual meaning, an individual plot, like an individual novel, a book for each person.""

I agree, which is why I recommend formulating your own answer. ""Each man must look to himself to teach him the meaning of life. It is not something discovered: It is something molded,"" wrote Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, well-known for his book ""The Little Prince.""

Taking a few moments to record your answer to the question ""what is the meaning of life?"" is the kind of simple exercise that effectively adds meaning to your life.

And then I suggest answering it every year. Looking back at how your thinking has evolved and been influenced by experience tells you something more about yourself. Cumulatively, it gets you closer to a deeper self-understanding.

In 1997, my answer was ""the discovery, pursuit and attainment of one's bliss,"" inspired by myth expert Joseph Campbell. A year later, is was to make ""the world a better place."" In 2002, the year I got engaged, it was simply ""Love."" And the year we conceived our oldest daughter, it was the less-romantic ""continuation of one's DNA to the next generation."" But most years, my answer is some combination of love, legacy, happiness, experience and helping others.

Subscribe to this column Don't miss another Wisdom Project column by subscribing here.

As a practical matter, if you want to do the annual ""Meaning"" exercise, I suggest not looking at past answers before answering anew, to avoid biasing your answer. I write them down on the same now-yellowing piece of loose-leaf paper, and keep it someplace safe.

The last use of this experiment is to try to turn your answer into action. If you conclude, as Tolstoy and Aristotle did, that the meaning of life to help others, that should help motivate you to do more of it. If ""love,"" is the answer, then love more. If it's ""find your bliss,"" then get searching for it.

This is not a theoretical exercise. Whatever small step you make toward finding the meaning of life is a step toward a more meaningful, and longer, life.",The meaning(s) of (your) life,http://cnn.com/2018/01/31/health/meaning-of-life-wisdom-project/index.html
92,92,2018-06-22 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) ABC rolled the dice on a new version of ""Roseanne"" with Roseanne Barr, and thanks to the star's unmanageable nature, wound up getting burned. After taking a principled stand by canceling the show because of Barr's racist tweets, the network has opted for another revival --a Roseanne-free ""Roseanne,"" indicating its new priority is simply cutting its losses.

It's a bad idea, one that risks undercutting ABC's previous action, and despite Barr's blessing in a statement, could open a Pandora's box of new headaches.

By ordering ""The Conners,"" a spinoff featuring other characters , ABC is clearly hoping it can retain a portion of the audience that made ""Roseanne"" the recently concluded TV season's breakout hit. But like the deal with Barr originally, the network might not have entirely thought through all the potential ramifications of striking such an agreement.

For starters, ABC is naïve if it thinks that cutting Barr out of the show will completely divorce her from the hoopla surrounding it. If the network received a hard lesson that being in the ""Roseanne"" business comes with its share of publicity heartburn, it's hard to imagine that she'll stay completely silent and spare them further Maalox moments as ""The Conners"" unspools.

Second, those who became convinced that Barr was punished for her politics -- and conspicuous support of President Trump -- will likely be irritated by this turn of events, eager to pounce on any sign of creeping liberalism in the show's profile. There are already signs that the spinoff will be divisive.

95,95,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) A group of five European politicians spent Sunday night on a rescue ship stranded in the Mediterranean with hundreds of migrants on board, in a desperate bid to secure a port for the vessel to dock.

The lawmakers -- three Germans, one Portuguese and one Spaniard -- spent four hours on board the rescue ship Lifeline, as they negotiated with Italian and Maltese authorities for permission to dock, according to the vessel's German operator, a non-governmental organization also called Lifeline.

The ship has been in limbo for five days after picking up hundreds of migrants off the Libyan coast on Thursday and being refused permission to dock in both Malta and Italy.

It is currently stranded 24 miles (38 kilometers) off the Maltese coast with 234 migrants and 17 crew members on board.

The parliamentarians are urgently seeking permission for Lifeline to dock within the next 48 hours, as conditions deteriorate on board and the weather is expected to worsen, according to Ruben Neugebauer, spokesman of the German non-governmental organization Sea Watch which is also helping coordinate the mission.

The ship has enough water, food and fuel to reach Malta and Italy, he added.

One of the MPs on board, Michel Brandt of Germany's Left Party, described the conditions as ""unbearable"" and said migrants ""need medical care."" He posted images on his Twitter account of people huddled under blankets on deck.

German Green Party MP Manuel Sarazin, who was also on board with fellow party member Luise Amtsberg, said in a tweet that the situation was ""unsustainable"" and ""dangerous with bad weather.""

Wir sind auf der #Lifeline, die seit 4 Tagen vor Malta ausharren muss mit rund 230 Menschen an Bord. Die Lage an Bord ist untragbar wird mit schlechtem Wetter gefährlich!

Also on board was Portuguese MEP João Pimenta Lopes, of Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), who in a video posted on his Facebook page said the migrants hailed from several African countries, including Nigeria, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Eritrea, Sudan and Chad.

""In their majority are men, very young men, 77 of which under 18 years of age,"" said Lopes. He added that there were also 14 women and four children on board.

It is unclear who the Spanish MP who went on board was.

It is the second instance this month of a rescue ship being forced to drift for days on end in the Mediterranean as Italy and Malta wrangle over responsibility. Just weeks ago, the Aquarius, which was carrying more than 600 migrants, eventually docked in Spain after Italy's new hardline interior minister and leader of the anti-immigration League party, Matteo Salvini, refused to allow the ship to dock.

Migrants huddle on board the Lifeline in the early hours of Monday.

Salvini seems to be maintaining his tough stance. In a Facebook live last week he warned the Dutch-flagged ship operated by the German nongovernmental organization Lifeline not to dock in Italian ports, and even suggested it continue to ""carry this human load to the Netherlands.""

The Permanent Representation of Netherlands at the EU rejected this suggestion, instead tweeting that the ship was owned by a German NGO.

On Sunday, Lifeline also hit back at Salvini, saying in a Twitter post ""Dear @matteosalvinimi, we have no meat on board, but humans. We cordially invite you to convince yourself that it is people we have saved from drowning.""

Blame game continues

Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said in an interview on Malta state television TVM on Sunday that ""we are in a situation that if we don't take decisions in the coming days, the situation will escalate.""

Yet he appeared determined not to allow the Lifeline to dock in Malta, saying in a government statement that the rescue had taken place in the Libyan rescue zone and been coordinated by the Italian and Libyan authorities.

Given these circumstances, Malta is under no obligation to take in the ship, he said, even though the vessel is in the Maltese rescue zone.

That said, Malta has twice given food and drink supplies to the stranded ship, Malta's Ambassador to Italy, Vanessa Frazier, told CNN.

Immigration continues to be a controversial issue for EU member states, with no clear resolution in sight. At an informal EU summit on immigration in Brussels on Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared keen to manage expectations that European leaders could reach a broad agreement on migration.

Countries will need to work on bilateral and trilateral deals with one another instead of waiting for all 28 EU member countries to reach an agreement, Merkel told journalists.

Cargo ship Maersk also stranded

Meanwhile a second vessel, a cargo ship operated by Danish transportation company Maersk, is also stranded in the Mediterranean after picking up 113 migrants off the coast of Libya on Friday morning, and being refused permission to dock in Italy.

The cargo ship had been traveling between Libya and Malta when the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Center (MRCC) called on it Thursday evening to rescue the migrants, Maersk said in a statement.

Under international maritime laws , the cargo ship was obliged to assist. But it has been left in limbo after it was denied a port of entry and the company is now ""awaiting further instruction from authorities,"" the statement added.

A cargo ship operated by Danish company Maersk, pictured off Sicily's coast on Monday.

The ship is roughly three nautical miles from the port of Pozzallo in Sicily, Italian Coast Guard spokesman Commander Cosimo Nicastro told CNN. He added that of the 113 migrants rescued, five have since been brought to shore for medical reasons, including an eight-month pregnant woman and her partner, and a young girl who needed medical assistance with her mother and sister.

The ship had 600 containers on board, many of them empty, Maersk spokesperson Mikkel Elbek Linnet told CNN. Maersk did not know what was in the containers, however it said some were refrigerated, suggesting there were perishable goods on board.

The company added that there was enough fuel on board to keep the refrigeration going.

Salvini praises Libya coast guard

Meanwhile, Salvini met Libyan Interior Minister Abdulsalam Ashour in the capital Tripoli on Monday, thanking the Libyan Coast Guard for rescuing 820 migrants from the Mediterranean on Sunday and returning them to Libya.

In a Facebook post, Salvini also took a swipe at ""improper interventions by NGOs.""

Last year Italy adopted an aggressive approach to halting migration across the Mediterranean from North Africa, backing the Libyan Coast Guard's rescue efforts and cracking down on NGOs operating off the country's coast.

However, Human Rights Watch and other humanitarian organizations have warned against returning migrants to Libya, a war-torn country where they say migrants are exposed to torture, slavery and detention.

Desperate migrants on a deadly route

The Mediterranean remains the world's deadliest migration route, despite sharp falls in the number of people trying to reach Europe by boat. That drop is partly ascribed to a deal struck between Italy and Libya last year, in which the southern European country pledged to bolster Libya's Coast Guard so it could spot departing migrant boats and house migrants attempting to cross.",European MPs spend night on migrant ship in desperate bid to secure dock,http://cnn.com/2018/06/25/europe/migrant-ships-lifeline-maersk-stranded-mediterranean-intl/index.html
96,96,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Rep. Maxine Waters pushed back against President Donald Trump on Monday, saying she wasn't calling for people to ""harm"" his supporters, as he tweeted earlier in the day, but to publicly protest his Cabinet members.

""I believe in peaceful, very peaceful protests,"" she told reporters on Capitol Hill. ""I have not called for the harm of anybody. This President has lied again when he's saying that I've called for harm.""

The Democratic congresswoman from California returned to Washington on Monday amid a heated debate over her comments from the weekend, when she encouraged people to keep pushing back on members of Trump's administration in public spaces, like restaurants, department stores and gas stations.

Her comments, fueled by frustration over migrant families separated at the border, came at the end of a week when Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was heckled by activists at a restaurant in Washington, DC, and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked to leave a restaurant in Virginia

""Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!"" Trump tweeted earlier on Monday

Waters' remarks prompted criticism from Democratic leaders Monday, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who tweeted an article about Waters and wrote that Trump's ""daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable.""

""As we go forward, we must conduct elections in a way that achieves unity from sea to shining sea,"" Pelosi's tweet said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, in a speech on the Senate floor, said, ""I strongly disagree with those who advocate harassing folks if they don't agree with you.""

""If you disagree with a politician, organize your fellow citizens to action and vote them out of office,"" he added. ""But no one should call for the harassment of political opponents. That's not right. That's not American.""

Waters, however, rejected the notion that Democrats have been critical of her comments. ""They have not been,"" she flatly told reporters when asked about the criticism.

""Don't put this on Nancy Pelosi,"" she continued. ""Don't put this on anybody. Put it on Trump. Trump is the one who's creating lies, trying to have people believe that I talked about harming people. There is nowhere in my statement -- any time, any place -- that I talked about harm.""

Rather, she argued, ""our members of the Democratic caucus are talking about civility.""

""But protest is civility,"" she added. ""Protest is about peaceful resistance to the kind of actions that we are experiencing.""

Pressed on whether she supported the idea of kicking someone like Sanders out of a restaurant, Waters said she supports ""their right to protest.""

""I have nothing to do with the way people decide to protest,"" she said. ""I have no way of telling people how to protest, what they should protest. Again, it started with the restauranteur, it started with people in a restaurant. I did not create that, I did not design that, but I support their right to protest.""

Waters described the attention around her comments as a distraction designed by the President. ""Let's not get diverted as the president is capable of doing, of diverting us from the real issue. This issue is not Maxine Waters. This issue is the children.""

She predicted the protests would stop when families were swiftly reunited at the border.

""I stand by my speech in saying that the protests have already started, they're probably going to continue, but the way to deal with all of this is simply to come up with a credible plan.""

97,97,2018-06-19 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) It was a close encounter in 2012 that made microbiologist John Jelesko take an interest in poison ivy.

The Virginia Tech associate professor was cutting up a downed tree with an electric chainsaw. What he didn't realize was that his power cable had been dragging through poison ivy. So, at the end of the day, as he coiled the cord around his palm and elbow, he inadvertently launched a career-bending science experiment.

""Within 48 hours, I had your classic case of poison ivy on my arm. And as a scientist, I said, 'This is interesting, how bad can it be? I'll just leave this untreated,'"" he recalled, sheepishly. ""In about two weeks, I had learned just how uncomfortable poison ivy rash could be.""

Uncomfortable sounds like an understatement. Jelesko said he barely slept while fighting the urge to ""claw my itching flesh off."" Eventually, he went to his family doctor, who prescribed oral steroids.

The experience sparked years of research into a plant he calls a ""familiar stranger."" He has studied the chemical, urushiol, that triggers that telltale rash and the plant's biology overall.

The tricky thing about avoiding poison ivy, Jelesko said, is the plant is highly adaptable and can take many different forms in different environments.

""It's remarkable,"" he said, with a laugh. ""There's just an enormous amount of things with this plant that are currently unknown.""

Here, he offers insights into how to recognize Toxicodendron radicans, the scientific name of the plant, before you risk touching it -- and what to do if it's too late.

Know The Leaf Shapes

The axiom ""leaves of three, let it be"" is accurate, said Jelesko, but those leaves can come in many shapes, even on the same plant. You're safe if the plant has thorns -- poison ivy doesn't -- but it does sometimes have little white berries.

Can You Recognize This Leaf?

All of these are the same pesky, rash-inducing plant. Poison ivy leaves sometimes appear with jagged or lobed edges, and sometimes smooth.

Clockwise from top left: poison ivy with smooth edges, jagged edges, notched leaves and round leaves.

Same Plant, Many Forms

Poison ivy can present as a vine or a shrub. When mature vines climb up a tree, their shape can even mimic that of the host tree. Simply pushing aside an innocent-seeming branch could make the passer-by pay a few days later, when a rash begins to well up.

Jelesko's latest research, which is not yet published, finds that in cities poison ivy tends to grow as a climbing vine, whereas out in the forest, most of the plants are ground-creeping vines. And poison ivy is much more prevalent in ""landscapes modified by humans"" than out in the middle of the woods.

Some poison ivy vines can be downright awe-inspiring in their size, like the one in this video

98,98,2018-06-19 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Perth Zoo has bid a tearful goodbye to Puan, dubbed the ""grand old lady"" of Sumatran orangutans, who died Monday.

Puan, who was believed to have been born in 1956, was gifted to the West Australian zoo by a sultan from Malaysia on New Year's Eve in 1968.

Although the 62-year-old was recognized by the Guinness Book of Records as the oldest living Sumatran orangutan in the world, Puan's legacy lay in the zoo's renowned breeding program.

As the mother of 11 children, Puan's genetics account for just under 10% of the global zoological population, according to Perth Zoo

Puan's 54 descendants have spread across the globe, inhabiting zoos in Europe, the United States, Australia and Singapore. Some have even been reintroduced back to the wild on the island of Sumatra.

Puan played a vital role in ensuring the viability of the Sumatran orangutan, which has been categorized as a critically endangered species, according to WWF . Only three out of nine existing population groupings contain more than 1,000 orangutans.

Puan, the ""grand matriarch"" of Perth zoo, had 54 descendents across the world.

For her keepers, Puan's importance went beyond just awards and statistics.

In an op-ed to the West Australian, zookeeper Martina Hart remembered Puan as ""the maker of the most amazing nests, and the lady who took no nonsense from her children over the years, but was also the most nurturing mother we had.""

She even exhibited those motherly mannerisms toward her zookeepers.

""If you weren't quick with her dinner, or you kept her inside a minute longer than she deemed necessary, she would let you know by tapping her foot to make you hurry along. You always knew were you stood with Puan,"" said Hart.

Yesterday the Zoo family farewelled Puan, the oldest orangutan in the world, due to age related complications.

Rest in peace Puan, may you climb happily in the jungles of the sky. https://t.co/C4vQwSA8Al

Perth Zoo also posted an emotional video on their Twitter page, where Primate Supervisor Holly Thompson described Puan's death as ""calm and relaxed.""

""Puan had people who had been working with her for a long long time, with her till the very end,"" she said, struggling to keep her composure.

""As hard as it was for us, it was the right thing to do,"" Martina Hart added. ""We're going to miss her.""

Although Puan may have passed on, a few of her surviving descendents remain in Perth Zoo, including daughters, Puteri and Pulang; four grandchildren, Utama, Teliti, Sekara and Lestari; and great grandson Sungai.","Puan, world's oldest known Sumatran orangutan, dies aged 62",http://cnn.com/2018/06/19/australia/worlds-oldest-orangutan-puan-death-intl/index.html

(CNN) ""Sex and the City"" celebrated its 20th anniversary this June. In Turkey, the first episode aired 18 years ago on a paid subscription channel, and I could watch every episode uncensored. This changed my life for the better.

I was 15, and I'd never felt like I belonged. While Turkey, and especially Istanbul, has always had a contemporary and rebellious streak, it was common to be surrounded by people who were just too narrow-minded. If they weren't religious, they were conservative. And if they weren't conservative, they had a collectivist nature. ""What would the neighbors think?"" ""What would the relatives think?"" I barely cared what my family thought of my lifestyle and personality.

Enter Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte. While Charlotte's less adventurous sexual choices suited me better, I related to the other three a lot more: A writer in love with clothes and shoes who arguably dated the hottest men. A gorgeous and successful woman who didn't give a damn what anybody else thought and lived her life the way she wanted it. A successful career woman whose cynicism I appreciated much more as I grew older.

Coming from Turkey, ""Sex and The City"" provided more than just funny and stylish escapism; it made me feel liberated. It allowed me and my friends to talk about anything and everything without shame. And mine isn't the only country it helped

That's why it feels weird when I come across articles calling the women on the show evil . Even articles that emphasized the show's impact and relevance, like this one from The Independent , had entries like this: ""Why did it focus on four white women? It was set in one of the most diverse cities in the world, did it never occur to the production team that it might be an idea to include someone of a different ethnicity?""

These points are valid, but they didn't even cross my mind when I watched the show then. Maybe because I'm never quite represented on TV anyway. An agnostic Turkish woman who loves wearing sexy clothes? A busy freelancer in her 30s who doesn't want children? A romantic who doesn't care if she ever gets married? Someone with OCD who manages it well

The truth is, more often than not, I don't want to see myself the way I am on the screen. I want a happier, healthier version who has fewer difficult problems, and has more dating options.

The women of ""Sex and the City"" were beautiful, (mostly) healthy, white women with good jobs, and I loved every second of their (mis)adventures, even the cringeworthy ones.

If we have to dig into what they did wrong according to today's values, let's not forget all the risks they took and the taboos they broke.

Criticism of ""Sex and the City"" cover everything from homophobia to general superficialness . But the truth is for every problematic joke, scene, and storyline singled out, I can come up with at least 10 examples where the show was progressive or compassionate.

Samantha dated a black man, and it ended because his sister didn't want a ""white chick"" dating her brother . She defined herself as ""try-sexual;"" she'd try anything once. She once dated a woman. Miranda took care of the ailing mother of her boyfriend. Carrie broke up with someone because he slapped her. Carrie's best guy friend was gay; Charlotte converted to Judaism for the man she loved. The show openly talked about abortion.

""Sex and the City"" put four women front and center, unapologetically being

themselves, flaws and all. It was the first show where men saw themselves being talked about as sex objects, as well as a show that made them face their toxic behavior.

And while the women could be vulgar, judgmental, and occasionally cruel, they loved each other. Their friendship saw them through break-ups, career ups and downs, cancer, wild disagreements, infertility, and beyond.

As a big fan, I'll admit the show had its issues, even if we judged the show by the 90's and early 00's standards. Carrie cheated on her serious boyfriend Aidan, having an affair with Mr. Big while he was married. Not to mention, Samantha cheated on Smith with Richard, the guy she had broken up with because he had cheated on her.

The way Carrie put up with Big's ridiculous behavior let me down. He strung her along, gave her mixed signals, and didn't involve her in his life. The same went for all the women in the show. They were beautiful, smart, and independent, and yet they tolerated a lot of unstable and unattractive behavior from men. What kind of message were they sending to the millions of women watching the series worldwide?

But because these characters represented extremes and were so different from one another, we got entertaining TV. You can't keep people tuning in episode after episode for years without conflict. You need political incorrectness and controversy to hook the audiences. You need mistakes, and you need characters to mess things up around the clock. Whether it was grossly mishandling their finances, committing adultery or insulting the looks of the man they loved, the women did a lot of horrible things.

While ""Sex and the City"" had problematic characters and storylines, it would be a mistake to ignore all of the ways that it helped to usher in new, groundbreaking series by exploring themes like sexuality, friendship, parenthood and interracial dating in ways that we hadn't seen before.

101,101,2018-03-11 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) As tens of thousands of Americans die from prescription opioid overdoses each year, an exclusive analysis by CNN and researchers at Harvard University found that opioid manufacturers are paying physicians huge sums of money -- and the more opioids a doctor prescribes, the more money he or she makes.

In 2014 and 2015, opioid manufacturers paid hundreds of doctors across the country six-figure sums for speaking, consulting and other services. Thousands of other doctors were paid over $25,000 during that time.

Physicians who prescribed particularly large amounts of the drugs were the most likely to get paid.

""This is the first time we've seen this, and it's really important,"" said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, a senior scientist at the Institute for Behavioral Health at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University, where he is co-director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative.

""It smells like doctors being bribed to sell narcotics, and that's very disturbing,"" said Kolodny, who is also the executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing.

The Harvard researchers said it's not clear whether the payments encourage doctors to prescribe a company's drug or whether pharmaceutical companies seek out and reward doctors who are already high prescribers.

""I don't know if the money is causing the prescribing or the prescribing led to the money, but in either case, it's potentially a vicious cycle. It's cementing the idea for these physicians that prescribing this many opioids is creating value,"" said Dr. Michael Barnett, assistant professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

CNN spoke with two women who've struggled with opioid addiction, and they described the sense of betrayal they felt when they learned that their doctors had received large sums of money from the manufacturers of the drugs that had created such havoc in their lives.

Carey Ballou said she trusted her doctor and figured that if he was prescribing opioids, it must be because they were the best option for her pain.

Then she learned that opioid manufacturers paid her doctor more than a million dollars over two years.

""Once I found out he was being paid, I thought, 'was it really in my best interest, or was it in his best interest?' "" she said.

To do the analysis, CNN -- along with Barnett and Harvard's Dr. Anupam Jena -- examined two federal government databases. One tracks payments by drug companies to doctors, and the other tracks prescriptions that doctors write to Medicare recipients.

The CNN/Harvard analysis looked at 2014 and 2015, during which time more than 811,000 doctors wrote prescriptions to Medicare patients. Of those, nearly half wrote at least one prescription for opioids.

Fifty-four percent of those doctors -- more than 200,000 physicians -- received a payment from pharmaceutical companies that make opioids.

Doctors were more likely to get paid by drug companies if they prescribed a lot of opioids -- and they were more likely to get paid a lot of money.

Among doctors in the top 25th percentile of opioid prescribers by volume, 72% received payments. Among those in the top fifth percentile, 84% received payments. Among the very biggest prescribers -- those in the top 10th of 1% -- 95% received payments.

On average, doctors whose opioid prescription volume ranked among the top 5% nationally received twice as much money from the opioid manufacturers, compared with doctors whose prescription volume was in the median. Doctors in the top 1% of opioid prescribers received on average four times as much money as the typical doctor. Doctors in the top 10th of 1%, on average, received nine times more money than the typical doctor.

""The correlation you found is very powerful,"" said David Rothman, director of the Center on Medicine as a Profession at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. ""What's amazing about the findings is not simply that money counts but that more money counts even more.""

Paying doctors for speaking, consulting and other services is legal. It's defended as a way for experts in their fields to share important experience and information about medications, but it has long been a controversial practice.

Pharmaceutical company payments to doctors are not unique to opioids. Drug companies pay doctors billions of dollars for various services. In 2015, 48% of physicians received some pharmaceutical payment

Dr. Steven Stanos, president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine, said he wasn't surprised that doctors who frequently prescribe a drug are often chosen and paid to give speeches about the drug to other doctors.

""They know those medicines, and so they're going to be more likely to prescribe those because they have a better understanding,"" Stanos said, adding that some of the money paid to doctors may have been to teach other doctors about new ""abuse-deterrent"" opioid drugs.

Stanos' group accepted nearly $1.2 million from five of the largest opioid manufacturers in the United States between 2012 and 2017, according to a recent report by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

Stanos said the money was used for various projects, including courses on safe opioid prescribing.

""I would obviously hope that a physician would not prescribe based on some type of kickback or anything like that, that they'd obviously be prescribing [in] the best interest of the patient,"" he said.

But Dr. Daniel Carlat, former director of the Prescription Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts, said the CNN and Harvard findings are in line with other studies suggesting that money from drug companies does influence a doctor's prescribing habits.

""It's not proof positive, but it's another very significant data point in the growing evidence base that marketing payments from drug companies are not good for medicine and not good for patient care,"" said Carlat, a psychiatrist who blogs about conflicts of interest. ""It makes me extremely concerned.""

Barnett, one of the Harvard researchers who worked with CNN, said pharmaceutical companies pay doctors for a reason.

""It's not like they're spending this money and just letting it go out into the ether,"" he said. ""They wouldn't be spending this money if it weren't effective.""

According to a statement by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, drug companies support mandatory and ongoing training for prescribers on the appropriate treatment of pain.

""PhRMA supports a number of policies to ensure patients' legitimate medical needs are met, while establishing safeguards that prevent overprescribing,"" according to the statement from the group.

Angela Cantone at her home in Greenville, South Carolina.

'I trusted my doctor'

Angela Cantone says she wishes she had known that opioid manufacturers were paying her doctor hundreds of thousands of dollars; it might have prompted her to question his judgment.

She says Dr. Aathirayen Thiyagarajah, a pain specialist in Greenville, South Carolina, prescribed her an opioid called Subsys for abdominal pain from Crohn's disease for nearly 2½ years, from March 2013 through July 2015.

Subsys is an ultrapowerful form of fentanyl, which is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

""He said it would do wonders for me, and it was really simple and easy. You just spray it in your mouth,"" Cantone said.

She says Subsys helped her pain, but it left her in ""a zombie-like"" state. She couldn't be left alone with her three young children, two of whom have autism and other special needs.

""I blacked out all the time. I'd find myself on the kitchen floor or the front lawn,"" she said.

She says that if she missed even one day of the drug, she had uncontrollable diarrhea and vomiting.

She said she brought her concerns to Thiyagarajah, but he assured her it couldn't be the Subsys that was causing her health problems.

""I trusted him. I trusted my doctor as you trust the police officer that's directing traffic when the light is out,"" she said.

She says that when she eventually asked Thiyagarajah to switch her to a non-opioid medication, he became belligerent.

""He said it was Subsys or nothing,"" she said.

Angela Cantone holds an opioid called Subsys that her doctor prescribed to treat her prain from Crohn's disease.

Cantone would later learn that from August 2013 through December 2016, the company that makes Subsys paid Thiyagarajah more than $200,000, according to Open Payments , the federal government database that tracks payments from pharmaceutical companies to doctors.

CNN compared the $190,000 he received from 2014 to 2015 with other prescribers nationwide in the same medical specialty and found that he received magnitudes more than the average for his peers.

Nearly all of the payments were for fees for speaking, training, education and consulting.

Cantone is now suing Thiyagarajah, accusing him of setting out to ""defraud and deceive"" her for ""the sole purpose of increasing prescriptions, sales, and consumption of Subsys to increase ... profits.""

Through his attorney, Thiyagarajah denied any wrongdoing but declined to comment on this story due to the pending litigation.

In a court filing responding to Cantone's lawsuit, Thiyagarajah denied all of the allegations against him and said that all medical care provided to Cantone was ""reasonable and appropriate and in keeping with the standard of care.""

His attorney, E. Brown Parkinson, said the doctor is currently practicing medicine, alternating weeks between his practices in South Carolina and New York.

Thiyagarajah might be expected to write a relatively high number of prescriptions for opioid painkillers, given that he's board-certified in physical medicine and rehabilitation with a subspecialty in pain medicine.

But he wrote an unusually high number of prescriptions for Subsys and other opioids even when compared with other doctors with the same certifications.

In 2014 and 2015, physicians with Thiyagarajah's certifications wrote an average of 3.7 opioid prescriptions per Medicare patient per year, according to the analysis by CNN and Harvard. Thiyagarajah, however, annually wrote more than seven opioid prescriptions per patient per year.

After about two years on Subsys, Cantone says, she took herself off the drug cold turkey.

According to an affidavit by an investigator for the Drug Enforcement Administration, Thiyagarajah's office was inspected by the agency in June 2015 and found to be prescribing another opioid, buprenorphine, ""for non-legitimate medical need"" in violation of federal law.

In March 2016, the agent conducted another inspection and seized 45 medical records related to Subsys.

The DEA did a compliance review and referred its findings to the Department of Health and Human Services, according to Robert Murphy, associate special agent in charge of the agency's Atlanta Field Division.

Cantone is also suing Insys, the company that makes Subsys. Insys denied allegations of wrongdoing in a court filing responding to Cantone's lawsuit.

Separate from Cantone's lawsuit, John Kapoor, the founder and largest shareholder of Insys, was arrested and arraigned in federal court in October on charges of bribing doctors to overprescribe the drug.

""Dr. Kapoor engaged in no wrongdoing and refutes all of the charges in the strongest possible terms,"" said Tom Becker, a spokesman for Kapoor. ""He looks forward to being fully vindicated after having his day in court.""

Kapoor resigned from the Insys board of directors in October, according to a company news release

Several other Insys executives were arrested in connection with an alleged racketeering scheme.

Separately, Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, is conducting an investigation into the opioid industry.

According to her investigation and the federal indictment, Insys used a combination of tactics , such as falsifying medical records, misleading insurance companies and providing kickbacks to doctors in league with the company.

Saeed Motahari, president and CEO of Insys, wrote a letter in September to McCaskill, noting that he was ""concerned about certain mistakes and unacceptable actions of former Insys employees."" He added that most of the field-based sales staff were no longer with the company.

""I stand with you and share the desire to address the serious national challenge related to the misuse and abuse of opioids that has led to addiction and unnecessary deaths and has caused so much pain to families and communities around the country,"" Motahari added.

The analysis

Sometimes, pharmaceutical companies pay doctors to do medical research. They also pay doctors for promotional work: for example, to speak with other doctors about the benefits of a drug.

Among the doctors who prescribe the highest volume of opioids, the CNN/Harvard analysis found that the largest amount of money was paid for that second category, which includes speaking fees, consulting, travel and food.

Concerns about payments to doctors by opioid manufacturers were brought to light last year in a study by researchers at Boston University.

Several studies published in medical journals in recent years have found an association between payments by pharmaceutical companies for various types of drugs and doctors' prescribing habits.

For example, researchers at the University of North Carolina examined the two government databases analyzed by CNN and Harvard and found that when doctors received payments from manufacturers of certain cancer drugs, they were more likely to prescribe those drugs to their patients.

""This study suggests that conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry may influence oncologists in high-stakes treatment decisions for patients with cancer,"" the authors concluded.

Dr. Patrice Harris, a spokeswoman for the American Medical Association, said that the CNN and Harvard data raised ""fair questions"" but that such analyses show only an association between payments and prescribing habits and don't prove that one causes the other.

It's ""not a cause and effect relationship,"" said Harris, chairwoman of the association's opioid task force, adding that more research should be done on the relationship between payments and prescriptions.

""[We] strongly oppose inappropriate, unethical interactions between physicians and industry,"" she added. ""But we know that not all interactions are unethical or inappropriate.""

Harris added that relationships between doctors and industry are ethical and appropriate if they ""can help drive innovation in patient care and provide significant resources for professional medical education that ultimately benefits patients.""

Stanos, the pain physician, said a doctor who gets paid by a pharmaceutical company and prescribes that company's drug might truly and legitimately believe that the drug is the best option for the patient.

""I hope physicians that do promotional talks prescribe because they think the medicine has a benefit,"" he said.

But Jena, one of the two Harvard researchers who collaborated on the CNN analysis, said he worries that money from opioid manufacturers -- especially large amounts of money -- could influence a doctor to prescribe opioids over less dangerous options.

""Every decision, every recommendation a physician makes, should be in the best interest of the patient and not a combination of the patient's interest and the financial interest of the doctor,"" said Jena, associate professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School.

""If we lived in a different world where none of these payments to physicians occurred, how many fewer Americans would have [been prescribed] opioids, and how many fewer deaths would have occurred?"" he asked.

From 1999 to 2015, more than 183,000 people in the United States died from overdoses related to prescription opioids, according to the CDC . In October, President Donald Trump declared the opioid epidemic a national public health emergency

At least one company has decided to stop paying doctors for promotional activities such as speaking engagements.

Purdue Pharma discontinued its speakers program for the opioids OxyContin and Butrans at the end of 2016 and the program for Hysingla, another opioid, in November, according to company spokesman Robert Josephson.

""We have restructured and significantly reduced our commercial operation and will no longer be promoting opioids to prescribers,"" a company statement said.

More than $1 million in three years

Though Thiyagarajah's opioid prescription rates were particularly high, many other doctors who have prescribed large amounts of opioids have also been paid large amounts of money by pharmaceutical companies that make the drugs.

Several patients have filed lawsuits against these high prescribers.

From August 2013 through December 2016, Dr. Steven Simon of Overland Park, Kansas, was paid nearly $1.1 million by companies that make opioid painkillers, according to the federal Open Payments database

Most of the payments were fees for speaking, training and education.

Ballou, one of his patients, says she remembers Simon bragging about how drug companies were flying him across the country to give lectures to other doctors.

""He said he was going to Miami, and they were going to give him a convertible, and he was going to stay in the best hotel and eat the best Cuban food he'd ever had,"" said Ballou, who filed a lawsuit against Simon after she says she became addicted to opioids.

Simon's lawyer, James Wyrsch, said he would not comment on pending litigation.

In court documents, he asked for the case to be dismissed, saying in part that Ballou's complaints that Simon improperly prescribed Subsys were ""simply incorrect.""

Bridget Patton, a spokeswoman for the FBI's Kansas City field office, said federal agents went to the office where Simon works, Mid-America PolyClinic, in July.

The clinic said in a statement that it is ""fully and willingly cooperating with all investigations"" and that Simon has not been employed there since July 24.

""We had a lawful presence at that facility,"" Patton said. She declined to say whether investigating Simon himself was the purpose of the FBI visit.

The owner of the pain clinic, Dr. Srinivas Nalamachu, told The Kansas City Star that the agents showed up with a search warrant for Simon's medical records involving fentanyl prescriptions.

Simon and his lawyer told CNN they couldn't comment due to the pending litigation.

Ballou said that when she was Simon's patient, it didn't give her pause that the same doctor who was prescribing opioids to her was also taking money from the companies that made the drugs.

But now she looks back with anger.

A Mother's Day card Angela Cantone's daugher made for her reads, ""Best of all mother likes to sleep,"" alluding to the many instances when Cantone says her opioid medication caused her to pass out.

Cantone, the patient who went to Thiyagarajah, the pain specialist in South Carolina, looks back with sadness.

She cries as she remembers the Mother's Day card her daughter made her in preschool. The teacher asked each child what their mother liked to do and wrote it on the card.

Her card said her mother liked to sleep.

""Instead of saying 'she gives me hugs and kisses or takes me to the park,' it was the years of her finding me on the floor,"" Cantone said. ""I feel like I failed as a parent.""

She becomes angry when she thinks about the hundreds of thousands of dollars her doctor was paid by the drug company.

""The medication that was being prescribed to me was for his benefit, not my own,"" she said.","For doctors, more opioid prescriptions bring more money",http://cnn.com/2018/03/11/health/prescription-opioid-payments-eprise/index.html
102,102,2018-06-12 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Columbia, South Carolina (CNN) Emmy Reeves shows off the My Little Pony mural she painted in her sister's room.

She points out other displays of her work around the family home: a portrait of a cat, a painting of a hillside overlooking Lake Superior, a small sculpture of her riding a wolf.

At 13, Emmy has undergone an awakening.

Just months ago, she struggled with the rarest of conditions: She was a child with Type 1 diabetes who was allergic to the insulin shots she needed to stay alive.

She was given an array of antihistamines to dampen her allergic reactions as a means of survival. But the result was that she slept about 20 hours a day -- and the possibility of dying from her daily insulin remained.

The very medicine she needed to stay alive was slowly killing her.

""It's horrifying to know that every day, you would give your child a medicine that, in essence, could kill them,"" mother Tiffanie Reeves said. ""It's just really scary.""

For Emmy, every insulin injection felt like fire spreading through her body, from her fingertips to her toes. When her parents tried to hug her, she'd flinch because the pain was unbearable.

The first time she was given an insulin shot, she stopped breathing, fainted and was rushed to the hospital. She was just 4 years old. In the months after, her parents held her down for every insulin shot. She'd scream and shout, ""I'll be a good girl!""

""We have to do this because we love you. This is what keeps you alive,"" her parents would say.

For nine years, she suffered like this. Beyond the pain, she developed cataracts and often broke out into extreme rashes. She was medicated so much, she struggled with memory and an array of other issues.

Her parents tried everything. They took Emmy to top medical institutions and spoke with insulin companies to get the least amount of preservatives in her insulin, because that's what they believed was causing the allergic reactions. Nothing seemed to work.

Desperate, her father wrote an email last year to Dr. Raja Kandaswamy, one of the nation's pre-eminent pancreas transplant surgeons. ""Her quality of life is degrading faster than we had hoped, so now we are looking for a solution that will allow her to stop needing insulin, while we find a solution to her allergy,"" Jack Reeves wrote.

More than 1 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition that destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone needed to allow sugar to enter cells to produce energy. For most children, the condition is managed through insulin injections and a close monitoring of their blood sugar levels. It is exceedingly rare for a child to have an insulin allergy on the magnitude as Emmy.

Emmy's father wasn't looking for a cure for her diabetes. He was simply hoping to give his daughter an improved quality of life to help manage her diabetes. Her parents feared that she would die within a year if she stayed on the same course of treatment.

Emmy Reeves holds her cat and a stuffed pancreas. She recently underwent a pancreas transplant that has transformed her life.

But that email set in motion a chain of events, resulting in the nation's sole pancreas transplant of a child this young in nearly 25 years. It also led to his daughter being cured of her diabetes.

""It's amazing. She's a totally different child,"" her mother said. ""Every day that she does not reject this organ, I'm going to hug her, even though she may get tired of Mommy hugging her.""

'You couldn't touch her skin without her recoiling'

Kandaswamy, the director of the pancreas transplant program at University of Minnesota Health, remembers receiving the email from Emmy's father ""like it was yesterday.""

Kandaswamy, who has two daughters himself, felt the pain of a father who desperately wanted help for his child. But there was little medical literature to guide or support a pancreatic transplant in a child. There have been other cases in which children receive a new pancreas, but those transplants are usually done in conjunction with kidney and intestine transplants.

Only nine children have received a sole pancreas transplant, Kandaswamy said. The last time a pancreas transplant was done in a child this young, he said, was nearly 25 years ago. That transplant was performed at the University of Minnesota in 1994 on an 11-year-old boy by Kandaswamy's mentor, Dr. David Sutherland, who is considered the father of pancreatic transplants. Unfortunately, that pancreas only lasted six months in the boy.

""Pancreas transplants are generally just not done on children,"" Kandaswamy said.

But his mentor taught him to always put a loved one in that patient's place and ask yourself, "" 'What would you do if it was your mother or your daughter who needed the care?' Ask that question, and you will get your answer.""

Kandaswamy said that's exactly what he did when Emmy first visited. ""I have two daughters of my own. One of them is very close in age to Emmy,"" he said. ""Looking at her, you could see: 'Hey, if this was your daughter, what would you do?'

""You couldn't touch her skin without her recoiling,"" said Kandaswamy, who is also a professor in the department of surgery at the university's medical school. ""Her quality of life was just deteriorating to the point that this was a cycle that would not be compatible for long-term survival.""

He had to educate others in the hospital about why he felt the transplant would work for a child. The university had a new pediatric hospital, and if the surgery didn't go as planned, the institution's reputation could be adversely impacted.

""There was a huge amount of apprehension,"" Kandaswamy said. ""I knew we were taking a big risk in that this may not go well.""

A team of more than a dozen doctors was put together to study Emmy's case: surgeons, anesthesiologists, nephrologists, allergists, transplant coordinators, pain management specialists and others.

After a four-day assessment in April 2017 at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital, they agreed that a full pancreas transplant was the best option of giving her a better quality of life.

""We didn't make the decision without due thought and process,"" Kandaswamy said. ""We had to do it because of the extenuating circumstances here.""

Kandaswamy felt that in the nearly 25 years since that first pancreas transplant on a child, the surgical techniques and post-transplant management have advanced to the point that his team could ""successfully perform a transplant in a child this young.""

A healthy pancreas would allow her body to naturally produce insulin -- effectively curing her diabetes -- but the surgery carried many risks, including the possibility her body would reject the organ.

""Pediatric patients, they have very active immune systems, and they will try to spit out any kind of organ,"" Kandaswamy said.

Emmy and her mother would also need to move to Minnesota from South Carolina to be near the hospital the moment a pancreas became available.

Before she headed north, though, Emmy created a bucket list: eat jambalaya in Louisiana, feast on a steak in Texas, visit the Grand Canyon and see her friends from diabetes camp in California, where she once lived.

The family hit the road. Emmy got to do everything on her list.

It was, her parents say, a farewell trip, should she not survive.

False alarms and the magic moment

Emmy and her mother arrived in Minnesota on July 15. They settled into the Ronald McDonald House, where families stay for free during visits at the hospital. They then had to wait for a pancreas to become available.

Three times, the calls came that an organ might be available. Each time turned out to be a false alarm. The second was on Thanksgiving.

At one low point, Emmy suffered a severe allergic reaction in January; she stopped breathing and had to be rushed into emergency care. Still, she battled on.

Then came the moment. On the afternoon of February 9, Kandaswamy called Emmy's mother with news that a pancreas was available. Emmy was watching a documentary about wolves, her favorite animal, with her tutor at a museum.

Mom let her finish watching the film and then told her it was time. They needed to rush back, gather up some belongings and get to the hospital. When they got to the Ronald McDonald House, the place was abuzz. Word had spread like wildfire that Emmy's moment had arrived. Families and staff cheered them on and wished them well.

At the hospital, Kandaswamy greeted them in the lobby. He explained that a procurement team had gone to get the organ about an hour away in St. Cloud -- that there was still a possibility it might not be a proper fit but that he was optimistic.

Emmy's mother, Tiffanie Reeves, clutched Ducky throughout the transplant. The stuffed animal was given to Emmy when she was first diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.

Emmy was prepped for the surgery so she would be ready when the pancreas arrived.

About 3 a.m., Kandaswamy conferenced in Jack, who was back in South Carolina with Emmy's younger sister. ""I think we are going to go ahead. The organ looks good,"" he said.

On Emmy's 210th day in Minnesota, the transplant began. That number isn't lost on the family: She was wheeled into the operating room on 2/10.

As Emmy underwent surgery, Mom clutched a tattered yellow stuffed animal named Ducky, who was given to Emmy after she was diagnosed with diabetes.

The surgery took more than four hours. ""It was a great, great feeling when we got her done,"" Kandaswamy said. ""But I knew in my mind that the job was only half done. We were excited but also cautiously optimistic at that point.""

The doctors had to make sure the new pancreas -- what Emmy nicknamed ""Player 2"" -- worked properly, that her body didn't reject it and that her body could tolerate the immunosuppressive drugs she needed after the transplant.

She responded well the first week, but in the second week after the transplant, her body began to reject the organ. Her immune system saw it as foreign and tried to attack it.

""I had to come and tell her that her body is in rejection,"" her mother said. ""We're not sure what's going to happen in the future.""

They decided to try a stronger immunosuppressant. ""We're already down the rabbit hole, Mom. We gotta do what we gotta do,"" Emmy said.

Ever since, her pancreas has functioned as hoped.

Dr. Melina Bellin, the pediatric endocrinologist with University of Minnesota Health who worked with Emmy, said it was ""touch-and-go"" early on, but everyone was relieved when Emmy's health turned around.

""It's particularly rewarding when you're at that point in the beginning when you're not 100% sure it's going to turn out the way you wanted,"" she said. ""It definitely makes it that much better when it does.""

Kandaswamy added, ""We were able to treat it effectively and got it turned around.""

With the healthy new pancreas, he said, her diabetes has been cured. She no longer needs insulin shots or the antihistamines that she was taking to try to limit her allergic reactions. The hospital slowly weaned her off all of those medications that were making her extremely drowsy and ""blunting her consciousness,"" Kandaswamy said.

""Then we saw the real Emmy. She started really blossoming,"" he said. ""It's like a cloud has been lifted off her consciousness so she can actually express all of this stuff in a big way.""

One of the greatest moments of his career, Kandaswamy said, was when Emmy hugged him: ""There was nothing more fulfilling than seeing her walk up, give me a hug and say, 'I want to go back home.' It's the greatest thing I've ever heard.""

Pancreas transplants are not recommended for most children with diabetes, but Kandaswamy said he hopes this case will open the way for children with rare conditions like Emmy who could benefit from a pancreas transplant. ""I think this will be an index case that will help spark that awareness,"" he said.

Speaking up to help others

In the family home in Columbia, South Carolina, Jack and Tiffanie Reeves are still in near disbelief at how well Emmy is doing. She's thriving in ways they could only dream of. Beyond her artwork, she's started playing the piano. She can go on hikes. She can shoot hoops. She can play with her younger sister, Abby.

Emmy Reeves shows off the mural she painted in her sister's room after her transplant.

""She's getting a childhood, finally. She's getting to be able to be a kid,"" her mother said. ""I mean, this child's achieved so much in just the three months since transplant. It's going to be pretty incredible to get to see what she'll be able to do in the next few years.""

The family agreed to tell Emmy's story in hopes that it can help other children suffering as she did. They know of four young children around the world with a similar insulin allergy as she.

""If our experience could help even one kid, I think it would be worth it,"" Tiffanie said.

Emmy is not out of the woods. The first year after a transplant is especially critical. Her body could still reject the organ. The family tries not to dwell on that. ""We still live life, and we don't let the worry and stress of that keep us and our daughters from living the life that we need to,"" her father said.

Emmy hopes to be a zoologist one day.

103,103,2018-06-19 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Kurdish journalist, filmmaker and human rights activist Behrouz Boochani has been held on Manus Island for over four years under Australia's border protection policy. He fled Iran when police began to arrest his colleagues. The views expressed are his own.

I am writing from Manus Island. I am writing from where I am held against my will. I am writing while isolated here with 700 individuals on this remote island in the north of Papua New Guinea.

The Australian government has kept us hostage here for five years. A great distance across the sea from us is Nauru, an island nation in the middle of a silent ocean. Almost 1,000 women, children and men are held there as hostages; just like us, they were exiled by the Australian government.

We are victims of what I have defined as state-sanctioned hostage-taking. The use of this particular strategy has been acknowledged by many who have been examining our situation, whether they are people from among the general public, the media or human rights advocates.

They highlight the fact that the Australian government refuses to accept us and that they also reject New Zealand's generous offer to take us. New Zealand announced publicly that it is willing to offer some of us a free and safe existence.

Recently, a Rohingyan refugee named Salim took his own life. He was a 50-year-old man with a wife and three children aged seven, nine and twelve. A friend of his, another Rohingya, told me Salim had fled genocide and hoped that by risking his life he could eventually provide his family with a safe future.

In 2013, Salim was successful in crossing a dangerous ocean on a rotting boat. According to his friend, Salim set foot on Australian soil after 19 July 2013; this date marks the implementation of a policy that involves exiling people (arriving to Australia by boat)to Manus Island and Nauru.

JUST WATCHED Inside the Manus Island immigration center Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Inside the Manus Island immigration center 04:58

The Australian government incarcerated him for five years, first in a prison deep inside the Manus jungle, and for the last six months in a prison camp close to the island's only town. And it is from this same prison camp that I write about the death of Salim and the fate of the other refugees.

Salim suffered from epilepsy, the friend said. And during all these years in prison he was never adequately treated for his illness; in fact, he was humiliated by the prison system's cruel techniques of psychological, emotional and physical torture. After enduring this pain and affliction for five years he died a gruesome death.

He had told his friends that he could not take the anguish and suffering any more, he said that he was weary of this life. Salim was the third person in a year to die tragically of a suspected suicide. He was the eleventh person to lose their life in the Australian-run prison camps situated on isolated islands, according to Amnesty International.

These days the refugees exiled to these places ask themselves this question: ""Who will be the next sacrifice?"" The reality is that the refugees have been asking this question over and over again throughout all these years. With the death of another refugee we feel the shadow of death looming over us with even more terror. Death calls and its sound becomes louder every day.

The exterior of Australia's former refugee detention center in Papua New Guinea's Manus Island.

The incarceration and death of Salim stands as a symbol for the hundreds of innocent human beings suffering as a result of the Australian government's political games. For years, we have been stripped of our rights and dignity here in these forlorn and horrific prisons.

Many have ignored the fact that the same government that inflicts this violence on us has recently won a seat on the UN Human Rights Council. Distinguished human rights organizations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and UNHCR have accused Australia of human rights violations on many occasions. But the Australian government continues to defend its policies and insists on continuing its strategies of exile and torture.

Australia takes the moral high ground and justifies its ruthless political approach. They explain to their citizens: ""We have detained them to save the lives of others at sea."" What is remarkable about this is that until now they have been successful in indoctrinating the Australian population with this brutal ideology, one which violates human rights.

What is clear is that the refugees exiled on Manus Island and Nauru have been forgotten, our plight has been erased from among the chaos that engulfs this world. The only time the media takes notice now is when someone dies as a result of psychological torture or physical neglect, and then only for a moment.

It seems that we disappear from the public eye until another death takes place. It seems that our message from Manus Island -- and the message of women, children and families on Nauru -- is only delivered when we pay the price of death.

The one thing that remains consistent over all this time is the unrelenting affliction. We are forgotten people discarded on forgotten islands. The question remains: ""Who will be the next to be sacrificed? Whose death will enable our innocent voices to be heard in the media again? Whose death will function as another message to the world that we are locked up in these island prisons?""

I get the sense that my years of journalism work and producing other writing from this island has not changed a thing; even if the whole world hears our voices I dare say that nothing will happen. It seems that the world is so overwhelmed that it cannot comprehend the complexity of our circumstances. It seems the world is too tired to do anything.

The actress talked to her friend Rabbi Shmuley Boteach last month for his podcast after she was fired and her popular ABC series was canceled.

Barr tweeted about the interview on Sunday, saying it took place the day after her show was axed.

The rebooted ""Roseanne"" was pulled May 29 after a series of bizarre tweets Barr sent. In one, she wrote about former Obama administration official Valerie Jarrett, ""Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.""

Barr appeared to be sobbing as she told Boteach she has black children in her family and she ""can't let 'em say these things about that, after 30 years of my putting my family and my health and my livelihood at risk to stand up for people.""

""I'm a lot of things, a loud mouth and all that stuff,"" she said emotionally. ""But I'm not stupid for God's sake. I never would have wittingly called any black person, [I would never had said] they are a monkey.""

Barr stressed that her saying she was on Ambien at the time she tweeted was an explanation, not an excuse.

""There's no excuse. I don't excuse it,"" she said. ""It's an explanation. I was impaired you know.""

She also told Boteach, ""I horribly regret it.""

105,105,2018-06-19 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Kate Andersen Brower is a CNN contributor and the author of the book "" First in Line: Presidents, Vice Presidents and the Pursuit of Power ."" She has written two other books about the White House, ""First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies"" and ""The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House."" The opinions expressed here are hers.

(CNN) The four living former first ladies -- Rosalynn Carter, Laura Bush, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama -- have broken protocol in unified fashion: they have called the Trump administration's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy of family separation ""cruel"" and ""immoral"" and ""a shame to our country,"" condemning the practice of family separation in more forceful and impactful terms than their husbands. Images and audio of children being separated from their parents at the border between the US and Mexico have captivated, and largely appalled , the country.

The tradition of former presidents being quiet bystanders to history and refusing to weigh in on the pressing issues of the day has been overthrown by this small group of women who realize the weight of their words and the power they command. All four of them are united in their roles as mothers and in some ways, while uniting publicly against the sitting president and his policies is an unprecedented act, because they are doing it as mothers they are shielding themselves from seeming too politically motivated.

It started, surprisingly, with the President's own wife, Melania Trump, whose communications director Stephanie Grisham told CNN in a statement on Sunday: ""Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform. She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.""

Not long after that, Laura Bush, the wife of the last Republican president, took a remarkable step and penned an op-ed for The Washington Post. In it she wrote, ""I live in a border state. I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart."" One Republican spokesman who asked not to be named told me he was surprised by how outspoken Laura Bush was being, but that he was proud of her: ""That unusual sound you hear,"" he said, ""is the voice of reason.""

The floodgates opened with Bush's op-ed Sunday, almost as though she was giving her fellow former first ladies, members of an exclusive club, the go ahead to speak their minds. Michelle Obama retweeted Bush's link to the piece and wrote,""Sometimes truth transcends party."" At an event in New York on Monday Hillary Clinton said , ""The test of any nation is how we treat the most vulnerable among us. Laura Bush made that case eloquently in The Washington Post this weekend. ... She is absolutely right.""

Also on Monday, Rosalynn Carter, the oldest member of the group, released a statement harkening back to her time as first lady seeing refugees leaving Cambodia for Thailand. ""I visited Thailand and witnessed firsthand the trauma of parents and children separated by circumstances beyond their control,"" she wrote. ""The practice and policy today of removing children from their parents' care at our border with Mexico is disgraceful and a shame to our country.""

Meanwhile, the White House is pushing back, activating a blame game, with press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen calling to task past administrations, including George W. Bush's, for signing off on laws that have contributed to the crisis immigrant families face today. ""Frankly, this law was actually signed into effect in 2008 under [Laura Bush's] husband's leadership, not under this administration,"" Sanders said during Monday's press briefing.

There have been many, many other moments -- among them Trump's campaign-era proposal to ban all Muslims from the United States and his insistence that Barack Obama bugged Trump Tower during the campaign -- when the former presidents could have spoken up more forcefully, but they have not, in part because of a longstanding tradition of former presidents not criticizing or undermining the sitting president from the sidelines. Bill Clinton, for one, has broken that tradition by tweeting ""These children should not be a negotiating tool,"" and calling for them to be reunited with their families.

But when it comes to the forced separation of children from their parents, it really is the former first ladies who appear to have had enough and who have led the charge. As a cohort, these women are wives, working mothers, and close political advisers who have been transformed into international celebrities simply because of whom they chose to marry. They are often beloved, sometimes vilified, and they are almost always their husbands' most trusted counselors.

While it takes a nation to elect a president, ""we were elected by one man,"" Laura Bush said in her commentary. Their position is not enshrined in the Constitution, and the role of the unpaid spouse seems incredibly anachronistic in today's world, especially since these women helped get their husbands elected and are then confined to the East Wing. But Rosalynn Carter understood decades ago the covert power a first lady wields. ""I have learned,"" she said in an interview for my book First Women, ""that you can do anything you want to.""

They have a sisterhood and friendship that often crosses party lines, as it did with Michelle Obama and Laura Bush who became friends, and before them Barbara Bush and Lady Bird Johnson and Rosalynn Carter and Betty Ford, who were all close. Last November, Laura Bush revealed that she has had tea with Melania Trump since her husband took office and told CNN, ""I just think she's done a lovely job."" She was largely sympathetic to the Trumps and said, ""I wish them the very best. That's what every American should wish for the people in the White House since they are our president and first family."" To be fair, George W. Bush made headlines last year when he criticized the isolationist policies of the current administration but he did not name any names. It seems separating parents from their children was a bridge too far for Laura Bush and she is bravely calling this White House out by name.

106,106,2018-04-09 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Washington (CNN) Florida Gov. Rick Scott shook up the Senate map Monday with his decision to challenge Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson.

Scott's entrance ends months of will-he-or-won't he speculation and brings a sigh of relief for Republicans, who had lacked a credible opponent for Nelson.

The Sunshine State contest is likely to be one of the most expensive in the country this year, making Scott's net worth of nearly $150 million an added benefit of his candidacy for Republicans. The Republican governor has shown a willingness to dip into his personal funds in previous races.

If Democrats are to have any hope of reclaiming the Senate majority they will need to hold onto Florida -- and most, if not all, of the other nine states with Democratic incumbents that Trump won in 2016. Republicans currently hold a 51-49 advantage in the Senate, meaning Democrats need a net gain of two seats.

More than 70% of sodium in an average American diet comes in packaged, prepared and restaurant foods

This is part two of a two-part feature. Part 1: Curbing salt intake could add years to your life

(CNN) We've covered the many health reasons to curb your salt intake. But let's talk about how, especially when it's hidden in many of the foods we love.

When cutting back on sodium, it's important to start slowly, as going cold turkey can shock your taste buds. ""If you try to make chicken soup with no salt, you will notice the difference,"" said Sonya Angelone, a registered dietitian who specializes in cardiovascular nutrition and is the media spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Instead, start with half of the amount of salt you would typically use.

You can also look for low- or reduced-sodium versions of your favorite foods, or make your own versions, like homemade spaghetti sauce. For example, canned tomato sauce can have 1,000 milligrams of sodium per serving. ""But canned tomatoes have about 300 milligrams, and tomato paste has very little sodium -- so you can just add water or low-sodium chicken broth"" to make a sauce, Angelone said.

Using herbs and spices can help bring out flavor in foods without salt. Spice blends without salt can come in handy during cooking. You might use a Mexican blend with cumin, chili pepper and smoked paprika for chili, while blends containing rosemary, thyme and oregano might be well suited for Italian dishes, Angelone explained.

When dining out, ask for steamed vegetables and fish, and skip the sauces. And when food shopping, compare the sodium values of similar foods. ""Some rolls can have 400 milligrams; other ones can have 200,"" Angelone said. Breads and rolls are top sources of sodium in the US diet, according to the American Heart Association , along with cold cuts and cured meats, pizza, soup, sandwiches and poultry.

108,108,2018-03-14 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Your stamina -- or the time it takes for you to reach peak exhaustion during exercise -- can be tied to your dementia risk, and a new study reveals how.

The study, published Wednesday in the medical journal Neurology , found that women with high cardiovascular fitness, or high stamina, had an 88% lower risk of dementia than women who were moderately fit.

""I was not surprised that there was an association, but I was surprised that it was such a strong association between the group with highest fitness and decreased dementia risk,"" said Helena Hörder, a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, who was first author on the study.

Dementia is the name for a group of symptoms caused by disorders that affect the brain , often leading to memory loss or other problems with brain function. Alzheimer's disease , an irreversible and progressive brain disease, is the most common type of dementia.

About 5.4 million people in the United States are estimated to be living with Alzheimer's disease , and it is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

About 850,000 people in the United Kingdom have dementia as a whole, according to the UK's National Health Service

Worldwide, about 50 million people have dementia, and there are nearly 10 million new cases every year, according to the World Health Organization

The new study involved 191 women in Sweden, 38 to 60 years old, who completed an ergometer cycling test to evaluate their cardiovascular fitness.

During the test, the women's workload was measured, based on how much weight or resistance could be added to the bicycle before they became fatigued.

""The level that you are so exhausted that you have to interrupt the test is a measure, in watts, of your work capacity,"" Hörder said. ""Cardiovascular fitness or endurance can also be tested in a submaximal test where you don't push the person to maximal capacity.""

Some of the women had to interrupt their cycling test at submaximal workload, before being pushed to maximal capacity, mainly due to changes seen on an electrocardiograph or due to high blood pressure.

Based on their crude peak workload, the women were separated into three groups: Fifty-nine were in the ""low fitness"" group, 92 were ""medium fitness,"" and 40 were ""high fitness.""

JUST WATCHED How to prevent Alzheimer's disease Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How to prevent Alzheimer's disease 03:33

Those cycling tests were conducted in 1968, and the women were followed over a 44-year period until 2012. During that time, the researchers tracked the women's health, taking a close look at who was diagnosed with dementia and who was not.

The researchers found that among all of the women, 44 of them (or 23%) developed dementia from 1968 to 2012. Yet among those who interrupted their cycling test at submaximal workload, that percentage jumped to 45%.

""Many of those who interrupted the test at submax, very low watt level, probably had indications for a poor cardiovascular health status,"" Hörder said. ""This might indicate that processes in the cardiovascular system might be ongoing many decades before onset of dementia diagnosis.""

The researchers also found that the average age at dementia onset was 11 years older in the ""high fitness"" group than in the ""medium fitness"" group, and the most pronounced risk reduction was seen among those with the highest fitness: ""High compared to medium fitness decreased the risk of dementia by 88%,"" the researchers wrote.

The study had some limitations, including that it involved a small sample of women in Sweden. More research is needed to determine whether similar findings would occur in a larger, more diverse group.

Also, the findings were not causal. So more research is also needed to determine whether improved fitness could have positive effects on dementia risk and when in life a high fitness level is most important.

For instance, other factors could have influenced the findings to help lower dementia risk, regardless of physical activity habits. Genetics or the cognitive stimulation of fitness could have influenced dementia risk, as well as the social aspects of fitness, as loneliness has been linked to dementia

""One of the missing pieces of a study like this -- and really the weakness in the literature to date -- is that the kinds of studies that we have mostly seen are association studies. These are studies of correlations, and they can't necessarily talk about causality,"" said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association in Chicago, who was not involved in the new study.

Still, he said, ""the picture that is really emerging from the literature is a picture about the importance of fitness in midlife, not just old age, when it comes to protecting your brain health and preventing or delaying Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.""

The new study adds to that overall growing body of evidence turning a spotlight on dementia and modifiable risk factors , such as poor cardiovascular health, a sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, smoking or excessive alcohol consumption

So people could try to reduce their risk of cognitive decline by engaging in regular cardiovascular exercise , stopping smoking, eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, staying socially engaged, challenging their minds by reading or playing games and of course taking care of their heart health, according to the Alzheimer's Association

""There's a very strong connection between cardiovascular health -- so the health of your heart and your circulatory system -- and the health of your brain,"" Fargo said.

""The reason for that is because the brain actually is what we would call a highly vascularized organ, meaning that your brain has many blood vessels,"" he said. ""The demand for nutrient-, oxygen-rich blood in the brain is very high compared to other organs, and so anything a person can do to increase their cardiovascular fitness level is likely to have positive benefits on brain health.""",Dementia study ties your risk to your fitness level,http://cnn.com/2018/03/14/health/dementia-risk-fitness-study/index.html

110,110,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Heather Locklear was arrested Sunday on two misdemeanor counts of battery on emergency personnel, two months after she pleaded not guilty of battery on a peace officer in a separate incident.

Sheriff's deputies responded to two separate calls to Locklear's residence in Thousand Oaks, California. The first call occurred around 6pm local time for a disturbance. Deputies determined no crime had been committed, according to Sgt. Eric Buschow of the Ventura County Sherriff's Department.

The second call came in around 11pm local time. Sgt. Buschow told CNN that deputies arrived to find a domestic disturbance involving Locklear and another party. According to Buschow, Locklear kicked one of the deputies in the leg while they were surveying the situation.

Buschow described Locklear as ""extremely intoxicated and very uncooperative"" as she was handcuffed and taken into custody. He added that due to her intoxicated state, Locklear was supposed to be medically checked before going to jail. According to Buschow, Locklear kicked one of the medics in the chest during the check.

After being evaluated at a nearby hospital, Locklear was transported to jail and booked. Her bail was set at $20,000.

111,111,2018-06-20 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Diana Butler Bass ( @dianabutlerbass ) holds a Ph.D. in religious studies from Duke University and is the author of 10 books on American religion and culture, including ""Grateful: The Transformative Power of Giving Thanks"" (HarperOne 2018). The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) In a rare move on Monday , more than 600 leaders in the United Methodist Church filed a strongly worded formal complaint against Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a Methodist church member, charging him with violating the church's Book of Discipline in his immigration policy, which details ""child abuse"" (citing advocating for family separation and incarceration of children) and ""racial discrimination.""

It is highly unusual that such a complaint is brought against a member (typically charges like this have been filed against clergy), but Sessions' support of the family separation policy was deemed so far outside Methodist social teaching that these charges could force a process of church discipline that might include an ecclesiastical trial with potential result of expulsion from the church.

In many ways, the last thing the United Methodist Church needs right now is a conflict over Jeff Sessions. The church, which has around 7 million members in the United States, is strained already to the point of schism over issues related to the inclusion of LGBTQ people and their role in the church.

While there is no doubt that many Methodists will applaud religious sanction against Sessions, there are many others who will not. For a church maintaining a fragile unity , the issues raised by the complaint could add stress.

This story could be perceived as ecclesiastical inside baseball -- just another church argument at a time when religion is declining in cultural importance -- but something much larger is at stake: the impact of religious crises on national politics.

The Methodists are not alone in feeling the weight of fracture. Last week, the Southern Baptist Convention met amid tensions over race and a #metoo scandal. While they eschewed some right-wing stridency from their recent past, it is clear that they, like the Methodists, remain deeply divided -- and may be moving toward the point of schism between a white old guard establishment and a more diverse rising generation.

Put simply, America's two largest Protestant denominations -- one mainline, one evangelical -- are facing institutional rifts that pit established policies of the past against activist calls for inclusion, justice and new leadership. Their shared tensions are not uniquely religious. Instead, they are experiencing stresses endemic across American culture. And their common struggle makes this a pivotal moment in American Protestantism.

Despite conventional belief to the contrary, major schisms are somewhat rare in America's largest religious groups. American Protestantism is notorious for its tendency to splinter, with enough breakaway groups to fill up several history tomes. But those splits are often doctrinally specific and based on single issues, and the resulting denominations remain relatively small. When large-scale schisms happen, however, they fall along worrisome fault lines that exacerbate social conflict, heighten tensions, and worsen intractable political tensions in American culture. In the past, those major breaks have occurred around issues of individualism and authority, slavery and racism, tensions between science and faith, and the role of women in leadership.

1845 proved to be a crucial year for both groups. In the Methodist case, antislavery leaders voted to suspend a bishop who held slaves; in the Baptist case, antislavery members attempted to bar slaveholders from missionary work. In both churches, antislavery activists attempted to limit slavery by making it morally unacceptable and geographically constrained. By 1845, all neutrality and all compromises were off the table. Although antislavery forces won crucial votes and changed important church policies, aggrieved proslavery church members left -- forming the Methodist Episcopal Church South and the Southern Baptist Convention.

At the time, clergy, politicians and journalists noted that the schisms were a blow to the Union. Most historians believe these actions were the prelude to the Civil War and, in many ways, contributed to the nation's further political fracturing.

Is something similar happening now? Does this ecclesiastical tumult foreshadow an even larger political crisis awaiting us?

The answers are, yes and maybe.

As difficult as this moment seems, I think that historian Jon Meacham is correct when likening our time to a ""Dred Scott"" moment, referring to the Supreme Court decision that people held in slavery were denied the rights of full citizenship. Meacham, like many other historians, has insisted the primary divide was between those who recognized enslaved people as fully human and those who did not.

As the rights of citizenship were at stake in Dred, during the 1845 schisms the rights of church membership were the basic question. Did fully baptized people held in slavery have the same freedoms -- in theological language, ""freedom in Christ"" -- as slaveholders? The churches argued about the Bible's moral teaching regarding slaves and territorial expansion of slavery (as related to Western mission work), in effect struggling with whether black people in slavery were fully human. These Methodist and Baptist ecclesiastical arguments would re-emerge as secular issues at the fore in the Dred Scott case . The churches argued these concerns a full decade before the courts did. And the results were strikingly similar: divides and schism.

Today, the Methodists and Baptists are not really fighting over mere ""issues."" They are fighting about whether women , people of color, immigrants , and LGBTQ people should, on the basis of human dignity and worth, have full rights, responsibilities and respect in their church communities.

We are in the run-up, that time of uncertainty when a whole lot of people are making terrible decisions that eventually result in an even worse conflict. To have both Methodists and Baptists echoing their past fights now is stunning.

History, however, is not predestination. Just because something resembles a moment in the past, unless one is in a ""Star Trek"" episode, doesn't mean that repeating that past is possible. We have historical free will. We can make similar mistakes or we do better. The breakup of a church -- or two -- may portend only the breakup of institutions unwilling to change, not the dissolution of a great nation. Or, the tensions toward schism might only reveal a generational dynamism pushing for a vibrant and just future, not the end of the world.

The piece on hannity.com was actually just a summary of a broader piece written by the Washington Examiner's Paul Bedard -- which carried the same headline and the same message: Republicans (and Trump) are actually in much better shape heading into the November election than people believe.

That conclusion was based on polling conducted by Zogby Analaytics, a firm run by pollster John Zogby, and shared exclusively with Bedard.

Here's the spine of the argument made in it:

""When asked 'Who do you trust more?' on the economy, it was Trump over Democrats 41 percent to 35 percent, and on national security the president again led, 40 percent to 38 percent. ... Added to the poll's other findings that support for Democrats is down among millennials, blacks, and so-called Walmart and NASCAR voters, it would appear that Trump is back in favor among voters and that the ballyhooed 'Blue Wave' is dissipating.""

113,113,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) England may have ended its losing streak with victory over South Africa, but there's no guarantee Eddie Jones' position as head coach is secure in the long term.

Jones has come under fire after his side suffered five-straight losses -- a run that stretched back to February -- and Saturday's 25-10 victory over the Springboks in Cape Town will be a welcome relief for the beleaguered Australian.

A try from wing Jonny May and 20 points from the boot of Owen Farrell helped England to a first ever victory at Newlands, a ray of light at the end of a 2-1 series defeat.

But Andy Cosslett, chairman of England's Rugby Football Union (RFU), says he can't offer complete assurance that Jones will lead the team through the 2019 World Cup . He is due to meet with Jones to review the tour when the team returns this week.

""You're asking for unconditional support but only my children get that. And even then not always,"" Cosslett told reporters in Cape Town.

""It's not something you give because you're under assessment the whole time. It's just not what we do. There are 600 people in the RFU and we don't go around telling them they're all supported.

""We have shown a lot of confidence in Eddie and we think he is still the man, but we will see where it goes to from here in terms of the next few months.""

Danny Cipriani made his first start for England in a decade against South Africa, setting up the winning try

A 'rough run' ended?

Jones' tenure at the helm of England's rugby team has been a tale of two halves.

He signed a two-year contract extension at the start of this year after winning 22 of his 23 tests since taking charge in 2015, a deal to secure his services through the 2019 World Cup in Japan.

England went undefeated in Jones' first 18 games in charge -- a record matched only by the All Blacks amongst Tier One sides -- before enduring a wretched run of form that included losses to Scotland, France, Ireland and South Africa.

""We've had a rough run of results, not least the players and the coaching team, and they've worked very hard to get out of it,"" said Cosslett.

""We all recognize that sometimes you get in a rut and it looks like you're never going to get out of it. We have and that's really important.

""Eddie came to our union when it was at its lowest ebb after the [2015] World Cup, grabbed it and applied what we hoped he'd apply. He took us on an extraordinary run and has tremendous credit for what he's done. We're very grateful to him for what he did at a time when we needed it most.""

Jones drew criticism before the series, and pressure mounted following the opening two defeats to South Africa.

There's been changes amongst the coaching staff as defense coach Paul Gustard agreed to take charge of English club side Harlequins next season before traveling with the team to South Africa, while Scott Wisemantel came in as attack coach following the disappointing Six Nations campaign.

'A stronger position'

As far as Jones is concerned, Saturday's result was a huge boost.

""We want to be the best team in the world and you have to go through these periods to find out things about yourself,"" he told BBC Sport . ""We have done that. Now we want to kick on.

While England scrapped to get back on track in South Africa, northern hemisphere rival Ireland was making history on the other side of the Indian Ocean.

114,114,2018-06-19 00:00:00,cnn.com,"On January 1, China banned all trade in ivory, a move aimed at stopping the killing of elephants by cutting demand for the material in the world's largest market. CNN traveled to Mozambique to find out if the ban is working.

Pemba, Mozambique (CNN) It's no secret where the ivory deals take place in Pemba.

Despite a new blanket ban on the ivory trade in China, the closest major city to Mozambique's largest nature reserve remains a smuggling hotspot for criminal gangs.

In shabby three-star resorts and half-empty Chinese trading offices, illicit deals are discussed freely, especially the illegal trade in ivory.

Posing undercover as ivory middlemen, an investigator is invited into a Chinese investment center near the international airport to talk business. The red-brick, two-story building is like many of its kind, where everything from cheap fashions to toilet seats are on sale.

They meet in an internet café inside the building and within minutes a conversation with a Chinese trader has turned to ivory.

""I have two tusks,"" our man tells the trader, flipping through photos of ivory on his smart phone, and promises to have a steady supply ready to export.

""How many meters do you have?"" the potential Chinese buyer asked in broken Portuguese, ""can you get ten meters?""

Haggling ensues.

The trader questions whether he can get the ivory into China.

""That's a crime,"" he says.

It's either a negotiating tactic to lower the price or a sign that new laws in China are having an impact.

But will those laws stop the slaughter?

Even closer to extinction Mozambique's Niassa Reserve.

Years of catastrophic illegal poaching have pushed African elephants closer and closer to extinction.

More than 30,000 have been killed annually since at least 2010, according to a study known as Great Elephant Census.

But 2018 was supposed to be a banner year for elephant conservation.

""The year of the elephant!"" one headline gushed. In January, the Chinese government banned all ivory trade.

By criminalizing the purchase of ivory, the ban is meant to stop people from selling and buying ornaments and trinkets made from ivory.

Conservationists heralded the move as the best chance yet to stop the slaughter across Africa and squash demand in the world's largest market.

Now, six months after the measure took effect, a CNN investigation has found that smugglers are still working with near impunity, and in some cases Chinese investment in Africa is facilitating the trade.

The Niassa Reserve in northern Mozambique, one of the last great wildernesses of southern Africa, is becoming both a test case and emblem of the ban's failures.

With more than 16,000 square miles of protected reserve bordering Tanzania, it's about twice the size of South Africa's famous Kruger National Park. It's become the epicenter of poaching on the continent.

So far, there has been no statistically significant drop in the levels of poaching since the Chinese ban was implemented, says Richard Thomas of Traffic, a wildlife monitoring group.

""The China ban was widely hailed as a potential game changer,"" said Thomas.

""But, there is no evidence that this has been realized at this stage.""

Rangers on patrol in Niassa Reserve.

China's role

Demand for ivory is largely driven by China, where intricately carved ornaments have long been considered a sign of wealth and ivory products believed to hold medicinal value.

But an investigator who is tracking the Chinese nationals suspected of running ivory smuggling networks out of Pemba, Mozambique, says the ban has done little to halt ivory transactions in Africa.

The investigator can't be named for his own safety; tracking syndicates can be a dangerous business. He's worked all across Africa, but he has never seen it this bad.

""This is the worst. This is the worst. This one, is the worst place,"" he said, shaking his head slowly.

He gathers actionable intelligence from a group of informers inside the very networks he is trying to bust.

Some traders are doing so well that they are buying up tracts of beachfront property along the azure coastline, he said.

There is some indication the ivory they're selling doesn't just go to mainland China, but to other places in Southeast Asia to be sold to Chinese nationals, tourists and others trying to evade the Chinese ban, says Thomas.

An evidence photo obtained by CNN shows Mozamican government property that was recovered in a suspected poaching case.

In mid-April, authorities confiscated 867 pieces of ivory in a container in the capital of Maputo, piled up with recycling and bound for Cambodia.

Fernando Tinga of the Mozambican tax authority estimates 433 elephants were killed to make up the haul that weighed more than three tons.

""It was a Chinese trading company, but the suspects were not arrested. They escaped once they heard about the seizure,"" says Tinga.

CNN's repeated attempts to get hold of the company were unsuccessful.

Aided by corruption Pemba, the capital of Mozambique's Cabo Delgado Province, seen from above.

Peter Trevor, an operations manager for the Wildlife Conservation Society says there's a direct link between Chinese expansion in Mozambique and the smuggling of ivory out of the country.

Chinese companies have built roads and railways, cities and schools all over the continent. In 2017 alone, China pledged $60 billion of investment in Africa -- just the latest commitment in a long-running trade bonanza.

And while China's scramble for African resources and tenders is hotly debated, the assessment by conservationists is uniform -- it's a major push factor of wildlife crime.

The connections are obvious, Trevor says, slapping his hand on a map of the region. ""Gold mining, gold mining, gold mining, timber. To slip a tusk or two into a truck full of timber is easy,"" he says.

Armando John Wilson, the prosecutor for Cabo Delgado province where Pemba is located, says he believes that Chinese are involved in poaching and ivory trafficking although no Chinese traders have been arrested.

He also blames corruption despite the country introducing in 2014 harsher sentences for wildlife crime.

""We have no doubt about it. Corruption is the source of the poaching,"" he says.

Wilson says measures have been put in place to punish corrupt officials and they have set up dedicated teams to just deal with wildlife crime.

""There is a commitment by the state to prevent this kind of thing,"" he says.

A ranger is seen in Mozambique's Niassa Reserve.

The investigator who is tracking the syndicates says that corruption is perhaps his biggest enemy.

The lack of prosecutions and money flowing through the system is hampering their ability to stop the poaching.

""That one, is now the biggest problem. I think they are buying their way out,"" he says.

Eden empty Mozambique's Niassa Reserve.

Ground zero for the gruesome work of poaching is in Niassa Reserve -- 13 numbing hours of dirt roads and overflowing streams away from Pemba.

The huge reserve should hold tens of thousands of elephants. But there could be fewer than 2,000 left, according to Philip McLellan, a conservation pilot brought in by the Wildlife Conservation Society.

The organization has had some modest successes combating poaching in the reserve. During the height of the killing season, they brought in a chopper to mount surprise attacks on groups of poachers. They've also developed systematic scouting patrols driven by intelligence.

But, for now, it's just McLellan and his Cessna 206 patrolling in the air to track the elephant population and scare off teams of poachers. Heavily dependent on grants, they can't afford to pay for much more

After days of sustained rain in the reserve, McLellan is skirting past the imposing granite inselbergs that thrust majestically out of the forest floor. He peers down at his iPad in one hand, his other hand on the controls of his plane.

He's tracking elephants, which are tagged with GPS tracking collars. After several wide arcs of the plane, there is no sign of the matriarch. ""We are approaching her last known tracks,"" he says. But all the way to the horizon it's just verdant bush.

The flight over Niassa to find the elephants isn't yielding results, the GPS icons of the animals checked off one by one.

Tracking to the left, McLellan points out the enormous granite of Mecula mountain.

""Herds often spend their time on there,"" he says hopefully.

The mountain slopes down into the Lugenda river. It is an ideal spot for an animal that drinks 50 gallons (227 liters) of water a day.

But lately, they have been only coming to drink in the middle of the night, wary of the poachers that come into their habitat by boat.

""That is the tragedy of Niassa Reserve. The pristine wilderness has been raped. The many elephants that used to roam this area are now down to the bare minimum numbers,"" says McClellan.

Poachers

Of course, prospective buyers and ivory kingpins don't actually go into the bush in Niassa to shoot the elephants -- much like a drug lord wouldn't harvest his own cocaine.

When scouts catch those that actually kill elephants in Niassa, they are often brought to Montepuez, a hub half way between Niassa and the Pemba at the coast.

Some locals call this trading town El Dorado because of the precious stones and goods that pass through its markets. Mozambican, Somali and Chinese vendors sell stereos, mattresses, clothes and rubies in the bustling market streets. And, of course, ivory.

A main street in the Mozambican city of Montepuez. The town is called ""El Dorado"" by locals. It's located midway between Niassa Reserve and Pemba, and surrounded by mining operations. It's also known as a hub for illegal trade.

Its prison is surrounded by a rickety reed fence and doesn't look much like a prison at all. The cell block is a stained cream tin-roofed single-story building. The iron grate is wide open.

In the under resourced, overcrowded prison, guards lead out a suspected poacher with his hands behind his back. like he is wearing cuffs. But he has none.

""We were in the bush when we found a group of elephants. I shot the first one, then I shot the second one,"" says the poacher, who goes by the nickname Tunda Tunda, gesturing his arms like a rifle.

Like other poachers, he is remarkably disconnected from the killing that leads to the trade.

A Tanzanian middleman hired him but he says he didn't know where the ivory would go or who the end buyer was.

Tunda Tunda says he already spent a year in jail for a separate poaching incident. But his choices are limited. He would do anything to help his family escape grinding poverty.

""I went poaching because I was suffering, I had nothing to survive and I am desperate,"" he says.

The poachers who kill the elephants are usually poor and just looking for a way to feed themselves or their families. Often, they don't have alternatives to wildlife crime.

""Poverty is causing poaching in Mozambique. Even if the Chinese ban is put in place at the end market, it is different for poachers on the ground. They hardly read the papers, they don't have TV sets. They will continue doing this to build up stock for buyers,"" says the intelligence agent.

The harsh truth is that even if Chinese government bans the trade effectively in the long run, it may not be enough to stop those who turn to poaching from a life of poverty.

And the investigator knows that he is running out of time. The criminal networks' ability to operate with near impunity makes him pessimistic. Sitting on his porch in the gloom he shakes his head slowly, deliberately, as he speaks:

""We will be losing all the elephants in the near five years if it continues like that. In Niassa, there will be nothing left,"" he said.",The last hope for elephants: Can a Chinese law help stop the slaughter in Africa?,http://cnn.com/2018/06/19/africa/mozambique-ivory-trade-china-africa-intl/index.html

Over the last few weeks, as stories of families being ripped apart and children locked in cages have proliferated, one thing has become very clear: If you are ever tempted to think we've reached the limits of cruelty from the Trump administration and its allies, think again. A report in The Wall Street Journal revealed that the Department of Homeland Security has separated a 10-year-old girl with Down syndrome from her mother and brother. Her father is a legal US resident, but she's been sent alone to a detention facility in McAllen, Texas. Confronted with this latest outrage, former Trump campaign manager Lewandowski reacted on Fox News Tuesday by waving off the issue and cracking his little joke.

Asked on Wednesday if he wanted to apologize, Lewandowski declined and claimed his ""womp womp"" was intended to ""mock"" the Democratic strategist who raised the issue of the girl's plight in the first place.

Lewandowski's ""joke"" is just a highly visible edge of a much broader, terrifying, pattern. His callous indifference here is not a personality quirk or accident, but a necessary feature for a regime that seeks to dehumanize and destroy in their pursuit of a white nationalist agenda . It's hopefully difficult to inspire the thousands of men and women who work for the government and in the private prison industry or the government to take babies and children away from their parents while feeling good about themselves. What kind of person can lie to a mother that they are taking their child away for a bath, then never bring them back, and still go home and feel good about their lives at the end of the day?

That kind of inhumanity requires stripping away empathy. To vote for people who enact such policies requires intense denial about the harms taking place.

The systematic destruction of immigrant families by the Trump administration is composed of thousands of such outrages. It shouldn't take the particular vulnerability of a disabled child to inspire empathy, protest, action, and change. Like all decent people, I have been following the stories from the border with intensifying rage and searching for useful ways to act (here are some good suggestions from prison abolitionist and educator Mariame Kaba).

Still, as the father of an 11-year-old with Down syndrome, this story is hitting me hard. I find myself reeling as I imagine my child taken away from me by a hostile state, unable to process what it must be like for this terrified incarcerated child. I know the long history of forced institutionalization of disabled children in this country and around the world , especially disabled children of color, and I fear for her.

rights The 10-year old, whose name has not been disclosed, is far from the first disabled individual being harmed by our government's attempt to cleanse America of its immigrants (an intention President Trump made clear with his use of the word ""infest""). As numerous disability organizations have argued , the detention of this child is part of a pattern in which disabled children and adults, despite their particular needs and legal protections, are being abused by the state. Agents have been raiding hospitals and deporting caregivers. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents recently arrested a young man with Down syndrome at his job, despite his eligibility for protection as a DREAMer. If these particularly marginalized but sympathetic figures aren't safe, no one is safe. No one is, in fact, safe.

Someday, I pray, this moment in our nation's immigration history will join other outrages in our xenophobic past. We have far too many, including the Chinese Exclusion Act, Japanese Internment, not to mention the long history of taking children away from Native Americans and enslaved peoples. I have to believe that we will craft a better politics and better polity that will come to reject the idea that caging children is a necessary part of protecting our borders or enforcing the law.

117,117,2018-06-14 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Many people feel more irritable, annoyed, or negative when hungry -- an experience colloquially called being ""hangry."" The idea that hunger affects our feelings and behaviors is widespread -- from advertisements to memes and merchandise. But surprisingly little research investigates how feeling hungry transforms into feeling hangry.

Psychologists have traditionally thought of hunger and emotions as separate, with hunger and other physical states as basic drives with different physiological and neural underpinnings from emotions. But growing scientific evidence suggests that your physical states can shape your emotions and cognition in surprising ways.

Prior studies show that hunger itself can influence mood , likely because it activates many of the same bodily systems, like the autonomic nervous system and hormones, that are involved in emotion. For example, when you're hungry, your body releases a host of hormones including cortisol and adrenaline, often associated with stress. The result is that hunger, especially at greater intensity, can make you feel more tense, unpleasant and primed for action -- due to how these hormones make you feel.

But is feeling hangry just these hunger-induced feelings or is there more to it? This question inspired the studies that psychologist Kristen Lindquist and I conducted at UNC-Chapel Hill. We wanted to know whether hunger-induced feelings can transform how people experience their emotions and the world around them.

Negative situations set the scene for hanger

An idea in psychology known as affect-as-information theory holds that your mood can temporarily shape how you see the world. In this way, when you're hungry, you may view things in a more negative light than when you're not hungry. But here's the twist.

People are most likely to be guided by their feelings when they're not paying attention to them . This suggests that people may become hangry when they aren't actively focused on their internal feelings, but instead wrapped up in the world around them, such as that terrible driver or that customer's rude comment.

To test whether hungry people are more likely to become hangry in negative situations when they aren't focused on their feelings, we designed three different studies . In the first two, run online with U.S. adults, we asked people -- some hungry, some full -- to look at negative, positive and neutral emotional images. Then they saw an ambiguous figure: a Chinese character or pictograph they'd never seen before. We asked participants whether they thought the pictograph meant something pleasant or unpleasant.

Each trial consisted of either a randomly selected negative, positive or neutral emotional image, meant to serve as emotional context, followed by a randomly selected Chinese pictograph, meant to be ambiguous to English speakers. Participants then used their gut feelings to judge whether the ambiguous pictograph meant something unpleasant, pleasant, or neutral.

Hungry people who saw negative images thought the pictographs meant something more unpleasant. However, hungry people's ratings after positive or neutral emotional pictures were no different than the not-hungry people.

This suggests that the hangry bias doesn't occur when people experience positive or even neutral situations. Instead, hunger only becomes relevant when people confront negative stimuli or situations. But why would hunger only matter in negative situations?

Affect-as-information theory also suggests that people are more likely to use their feelings as information about the world around them when those feelings match the situation they're in. Hunger likely only becomes relevant in negative situations because hunger itself produces unpleasant feelings -- making it easier to mistake the cause of those feelings to be the negative things around you, rather than your hunger.

Tuning in to your feelings

In the final study, we recreated in the laboratory a frustrating situation to test how hunger and awareness -- or lack thereof -- might cause hanger.

We assigned two random groups of undergraduate students to fast for at least five hours or eat a full meal before coming to our lab. There we assigned them to write a story that was meant either to direct their attention to emotional information, or to not focus on emotions at all. Then everyone did a long, tedious computer task. At the end of the task, we secretly programmed the computer to ""crash."" The researcher blamed the participant for the computer malfunction and told them they'd have to redo the task once it was fixed.

It turned out that hungry people who hadn't focused on feelings beforehand exhibited more signs of being hangry. They reported feeling more stressed, hateful and other negative emotions and rated the researcher as being more ""judgmental,"" compared to full individuals and the hungry people who did write about emotions earlier.

These findings suggest that feeling hangry occurs when your hunger-induced negativity gets blamed on the external world around you. You think that person who cut you off on the road is the one who made you angry -- not the fact that you're ravenous. This seems to be a fairly unconscious process: People don't even realize they're making these attributions.

Our data suggest that paying attention to feelings may short circuit the hangry bias -- and even help reduce hanger once you notice it.

Although these studies provide a valuable glimpse into the ways that physical states, like hunger, can temporarily shape our feelings and behaviors, they are only a first step. For example, our studies only address hunger effects in healthy populations where individuals eat regularly. It would be interesting to look at how feeling hangry could change with long-term dieting or conditions like diabetes or eating disorders.

These studies alongside other emerging science suggest that our bodies can deeply shape how we think, feel and act -- whether we realize it or not. We're generally aware that emotions like feeling stressed can influence our health, but the reverse direction is also true. Our bodies and physical health have the power to shape our mental lives, coloring who we are and the way we experience the world around us.

Warding off hanger

Here are three pro tips to help keep your hunger from going full-blown hangry.

First, it may seem obvious, but pay more attention to your hunger. People vary a lot in how sensitive they are to hunger and other bodily cues. Maybe you don't notice you're hungry until you're already ravenous. Plan ahead -- carry healthy snacks, eat a protein-filled breakfast or lunch to give you lasting energy -- and set yourself reminders to eat regularly. These basic precautions help prevent you from becoming overly hungry in the first place.

But what if you're already super hungry and can't eat right away? Our findings suggest people are more likely to be biased by hunger in negative situations. Maybe you're stuck in bad traffic or you have a stressful deadline. In these cases, try to make your environment more pleasant. Listen to an amusing podcast while you drive. Put on pleasant music while you work. Do something to inject positivity into your experience.

Most importantly, your awareness can make all the difference. Yes, maybe you're hungry and starting to feel road rage, overwhelmed with your task deadline, or wounded by your partner's words. But amid the heat of those feelings, if you can, step back for a moment and notice your growling stomach. This could help you recognize that hunger is part of why you feel particularly upset.

"" She is a professor of English at New Jersey City University. The views expressed here are solely hers.

(CNN) June 19 is the anniversary of the day in 1865 that black people in Galveston, Texas, belatedly learned from the Union Army that the Civil War was over and that they were freed. African-Americans have celebrated Juneteenth since 1866 as both a commemoration of freedom and a remembrance of the lies of whites.

The news that the war was over was withheld from Kossola, known in his American life as Cudjo Lewis, the subject of Zora Neale Hurston's recently published "" Barracoon ,"" as well. Although Robert E. Lee surrendered on April 10 , Kossola's owner, the brother of the man who had led the voyage to enslave him, failed to tell him that he was free. He learned it on April 12, from Union soldiers. The time lag was less dramatic than for the Galveston people, yet the theft of additional days of his life resonates in this account of a stolen life.

Between 1928 and 1931, Zora Neale Hurston spent months getting to know the last survivor of the last slave ship to land in the United States, and wrote up their conversations. The resulting work, ""Barracoon,"" has finally been published over 80 years later after spending decades in Howard University's library. Hurston is best known for her groundbreaking novel, ""Their Eyes Were Watching God,"" but it is her training as an anthropologist -- how her careful listening and writing preserved a record of a unique life -- that enabled ""Barracoon"" to challenge the dominant, popular story of the Middle Passage and African enslavement in ways that still teach us today.

In Hurston's conversations with Kossola, he emerges as an extraordinary and representative man who endured unimaginable horror, loss and trauma, who was robbed and disregarded, but who built up a family and community and endured. ""Barracoon"" brings him to the reader in conversation and relationship with Hurston the anthropologist and loving story hearer -- eating crabs, offering peaches from his yard, photographed in his chosen clothing and stance. She needed and wanted to tell his story richly and beautifully, because for decades the story of the transatlantic slave trade had been told almost entirely by white people, who celebrated slave ship voyages as a way white youths became men. Their stories were part of the Lost Cause ideology. They have left their mark on American understanding of history. Hurston's now-recovered story of Kossola's life fought back against them.

Hurston conducted her work at a time when, since the 1870s, American magazines had been publishing memoirs and stories by whites that made buying, transporting and selling Africans part of the same Lost Cause ideology that helped build Confederate monuments and generated textbooks glorifying slavery. It was part of the package that claimed that the Civil War was fought over states rights, not slavery, and that happy plantation life and Confederate honor and gallantry on the field were the real stories to be told repeatedly. By the time readers browsed through two or three such slave ship stories in Harper's Monthly, Scribner's or The Century, they assumed they were reading accurate reflections of events. Formulas have that power.

From the 1880s through the 1920s, such magazines published dozens of works that framed the Middle Passage as a site of white male adventure, ingenuity, derring-do, and of black invisibility. Some of the writers were ex-Confederate officers. Hurston complains in ""Barracoon"": ""All these words from the seller, but not one word from the sold. The Kings and Captains whose words moved ships. But not one word from the cargo. The thoughts of the 'black ivory' and 'the coin of Africa' had no market value.""

Hurston's exasperation reflected her awareness that such narratives contributed to white supremacist myth making , which in turn gave rise to the movement to memorialize the Confederacy in monuments and statues across the South.

These formulas still have power. The myths of contented slaves and stories of Confederate battlefield courage as an absolute virtue, detached from the fact of fighting to uphold slave owning, continue to be told and believed. Generations have assumed ""Gone with the Wind"" is the true history of the old South. Students and parents have had to be vigilant to block textbooks that claim enslaved people were immigrant workers, as a 2015 McGraw Hill textbook asserted. How many editorial gatekeepers saw nothing wrong in that claim and let it be published? Even teachers imagine that there must be some truth to it if so many people say that slavery had its good points, so a Texas charter school teacher recently felt free to assign students to ""list the positive aspects of slavery,"" and the child whose parents objected is getting pushback from others at school.

Neo-Confederates have sought to rebrand white supremacy as just a form of history. In 2016 and 2017, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant could continue to proclaim April as Confederate Heritage Month in his state, despite objections, declaring that his intent is to have Mississippians ""understand and appreciate our heritage."" The repeated assertion of these claims, in many forms, normalizes them and lets whites escape being made uncomfortable by the truth.

These slave ship accounts, like Wilburn Hall's ""The Capture of the Slave Ship Cora: The Last Slaver Taken by the United States"" published in 1894 in The Century, are often set on a US Navy ship that seizes a slaver, after the official ban on bringing new slaves into the United States in 1808. Typically, they focus on the coming of age of a young white man, while the enslaved people on board are barely visible.

When Wilburn Hall is given command of the captured ship, he takes on the slave ship captain's role, and accepts that his job is to transport the Africans as though they were cargo. The story suggests that there is only one possible role for a white man to take in relation to black people and makes clear that it is the relationship between different types of white men that matters, not the Africans' lives. Like most magazines that published these narratives, The Century addressed well-off people; it made a specialty of rewriting the Civil War to focus on reconciling white North and South, in part to bring in more Southern readers.

White supremacist stories of the Middle Passage are now mostly forgotten. Anyone now might bridle at the claim those stories repeated that enslaving Africans was for their own good because it Christianized them. But when powerful formulas accomplish their work they leave their shadow in the enduring assumption that kidnapping and enslavement were like ""voluntary immigration,"" and there must have been something good in slavery.

If these narratives show white supremacist myth making in action, Hurston's ""Barracoon"" exemplifies African-American resistance to it. Hurston reused parts of another Lost Cause slave ship account , Emma Langdon Roche's 1914 ""Historic Sketches of the South,"" an account of the ""last slave ship,"" when she first wrote about Cudjo Lewis/Kossola in a 1927 article. In terms made familiar in decades of writing about the adventure of sailing slave ships, Roche celebrates the ship owners' adventure-seeking cunning and daring as they shaped the 1859 slaving expedition that captured Kossola. Hurston's biographer, Robert Hemenway , in 1980 slammed Hurston's use of it as plagiarism. But Roche's text also attacks black people as ""the wildest barbarians"" and defends the Ku Klux Klan, so perhaps Hurston felt justified in taking over bits of the book to undermine them, and to force it to tell something closer to the real story of a man stolen from his land and family.

Kossola, in his conversations with Hurston, frequently interposes the phrase, ""you unnerstand me."" The phrase reaches out to the reader: Could we possibly understand him? For Hurston, talking to Kossola was the last chance to listen to someone who lived through the Middle Passage. The question punctuates the narrative. None of the white writers of Lost Cause slave ship accounts had the slightest concern about whether their readers understood the Africans on board. Hurston saved her conversations with Kossola, and subverted the formula.

121,121,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) India is the most dangerous country in the world to be a woman because of the high risk of sexual violence and slave labor, a new survey of experts shows.

The Thomson Reuters Foundation released its results Tuesday of a survey of 550 experts on women's issues, finding India to the be the most dangerous nation for sexual violence against women, as well as human trafficking for domestic work, forced labor, forced marriage and sexual slavery, among other reasons.

It was also the most dangerous country in the world for cultural traditions that impact women, the survey found, citing acid attacks, female genital mutilation, child marriage and physical abuse. India was the fourth most dangerous country for women in the same survey seven years ago.

India's rape and sexual assault problem came to the fore in 2012 with the gang rape and murder of a female student on a bus in New Delhi.

Despite a strong public reaction to the case and repeated calls to improve safety for women in India, around 100 sexual assaults are reported to police in the country every day , according to the National Crime Records Bureau.

Nine of the 10 countries on the list were from Asia, the Middle East or Africa. At number 10 was the United States, the only Western country to be included.

The foundation said this was directly related to the #MeToo movement.

""The United States shot up in the rankings after tying (for) third with Syria when respondents were asked which was the most dangerous country for women in terms of sexual violence including rape, sexual harassment, coercion into sex and the lack of access to justice in rape cases. It was ranked sixth for non-sexual violence,"" according to the survey.

War-torn Afghanistan ranked second, as the worst country for non-sexual violence against women, which includes conflict-related violence and domestic abuse. It also ranked second worst for access to healthcare and access to economic resources and discrimination.

Syria, where a war has raged for more than seven years, ranked third on the list. The country is considered the second-most dangerous in terms of sexual violence and access to healthcare. Syria also tied for third with the United States in terms of sexual violence and harassment.

The Thomson Reuters Foundation held a similar survey seven years ago, and found Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan, India and Somalia to the be the five most dangerous countries for women.

""World leaders vowed three years ago to eliminate all forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls by 2030, allowing them to live freely and safely to participate equally in political, economic and public life. But despite this pledge it is estimated that one in three women globally experience physical or sexual violence during their lifetime,"" the foundation said.

""Child marriage is still rife, with almost 750 million women and girls married before their 18th birthday, resulting in teen pregnancies that can put their health at risk and limiting schooling and opportunities.""","India the most dangerous country to be a woman, survey shows",http://cnn.com/2018/06/25/health/india-dangerous-country-women-survey-intl/index.html
122,122,2018-06-21 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) The dinosaurs are fine in ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom."" It's the people that are ridiculous and irritating, so much so that this latest sequel -- which weaves in warnings about tampering with nature and genetic engineering -- is a near-case study in mindless monster franchises run amok.

Picking up three years after "" Jurassic World ,"" the story quickly reunites Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard, in more sensible shoes this time) and dino wrangler Owen (Chris Pratt), who have had time to date and break up, the better to have them re-bond over their latest ordeal.

Still, the set-up is pretty absurd, with Claire now running a campaign to save the dinosaurs, who are in danger of becoming extinct all over again because the island where remnants of them have survived is about to be overwhelmed by a volcanic explosion. So Owen, Claire and a couple of new but equally poorly written characters (Justice Smith, Daniella Pineda) are drafted to embark on a mission to help transport the dinosaurs off the island, which, alas, only takes up about half of the movie, before a more nefarious plot kicks into gear.

Released to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the original, there are several modest callbacks to the earlier films, including a too-brief cameo featuring Jeff Goldblum's character, there to deliver a cautionary note -- again -- about the dangers of dabbling in forces beyond our control and altering natural history.

For the most part, though, ""Fallen Kingdom"" (the fifth entry under the ""Jurassic"" banner) basically careens from one perilous encounter to the next, in a manner that generally feels more chaotic than exciting. Nor does it help that the heroes keep putting themselves in precarious situations, like trying to extract blood from a sleeping T-rex because, well, never mind.

123,123,2018-06-20 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Leaning out of a helicopter's open door, 500 feet above the ground, David Kennedy is treated to bird's eye views of immense sand dunes and lava fields strewn with giant black domes and boulders. Among these natural wonders are mysterious triangular constructions, a beautifully preserved ghost town and elaborate ancient tombs -- the archaeological treasures which Saudi Arabia hopes will earn it a place on the heritage tourism map.

This other worldly landscape is Al-Ula county. Covering nearly 9,000 square miles (22,500 sq km), in north-west Saudi Arabia, it is about the same size as New Jersey.

Kennedy is part of an international team carrying out what they say is the Kingdom's largest ever archaeological survey, which began in March. Unlike its regional neighbors Egypt and Jordan, Saudi Arabia is not well-known for ancient history. But that might be about to change.

Team members say they have already identified thousands of archaeological sites, found evidence suggesting that people have lived in the area for much longer than was previously thought, and encountered bizarre structures, the function and meaning of which are shrouded in mystery.

This carving dates from the period before 6,000 BC, when ostriches lived in Al-Ula. Climate change records show that after this time, the landscape transitioned from savannah to desert. As the environment dried up, the ostriches were driven south to their current range in Africa.

Al-Ula – A massive archaeological survey has been launched in Al-Ula county, in north west Saudi Arabia, as the Kingdom prepares to develop the area and open up to mainstream tourism. Covering nearly 9000 square miles (22,500 sq km), Al-Ula county has a dramatic desert landscape.

Amr Al Madani, CEO of the Royal Commission for Al-Ula (RCU), which was established last July to drive the development, hopes the region will welcome its first visitors in four years and that by 2035, once the project is complete, up to 1.5 million tourists will visit annually.

To put that in perspective, 464,000 tourists visited Petra, in Jordan, and 5.4 million visited Egypt in its entirety in 2016.

""Al-Ula will be a living heritage, nature and cultural museum -- a destination that both surprises and delights,"" says Al Madani.

The birth of Saudi tourism?

Until now, almost all international visitors to Saudi Arabia have been either business travelers or religious pilgrims, but the government says it is opening up the country to mainstream tourism as part of economic reforms designed to end its dependency on oil exports, outlined in its Vision 2030 plan.

As well as Al-Ula, the Kingdom is developing a string of resorts along the Red Sea coast , and a Six Flags-branded theme park in Riyadh. However, a tourist visa that had been expected to launch in April has not yet been released -- a representative of the Saudi government told CNN that regulations are still being reviewed by the Royal Court.

The potential jewel in Saudi Arabia's heritage tourism crown is Mada'in Salih. A collection of 111 spectacular tombs carved into rocky outcrops, and one of four UNESCO world heritage sites in the country, Mada'in Salih was built by the Nabataeans, the same civilization that created the much better-known settlement at Petra in Jordan.

Along with other key sights in Al-Ula, Mada'in Salih is currently closed to the public. It will re-open when the RCU has decided how best to showcase its heritage to large numbers of visitors, while ensuring that it is carefully preserved.

Last September, the commission hired Rebecca Foote, a London-based American archaeologist, to establish an archaeology and cultural heritage department. Her first project is the survey: its aim is to identify and document all remains of past human activity, and create an inventory that will help to determine which sites merit further study, conserving and being developed for tourism.

""It's an extraordinary opportunity,"" says Foote. ""You rarely get the chance to carry out a best-practice, state-of-the-art integrated survey on such a large scale and in a landscape that's largely undisturbed.""

Down in the valley

While Kennedy leads the survey of Al-Ula's ""hinterland"" another group within Foote's team is focused on the project's ""core area."" Covering 1,100 square miles (2,890 sq km), it encompasses a valley -- also called Al-Ula -- hemmed in by sheer-sided mountains that rise 1,000 feet on both sides.

Once rich in water, the Al-Ula valley has channeled people, and trade, along its wide, flat floor for thousands of years.

Early settlements prospered thanks to passing traders transporting frankincense, myrrh and precious stones. Foote says that the first major city here, Dedan -- now called Al-Khuraybah -- was established during the first millennium BC. ""The route from the south to Mesopotamia, Egypt and beyond ran up the western side of the Arabian Peninsula,"" says Foote. Well-trodden paths linked oasis to oasis, like a dot-to-dot drawing. ""The oases provided water for people and animals,"" says Foote, adding that camels -- which can survive with only occasional access to water -- enabled long-distance trading.

The trade route eventually diminished after seacraft that could safely navigate the treacherous Red Sea were developed.

The valley remained relatively quiet for several hundred years and then boomed again, when Islam was established in the Middle East. ""Mecca and Medina became the heartlands of the religion and a destination for pilgrims,"" says Foote. ""Al-Ula lay on the route south from Syria.""

In recent years, archaeologists have conducted research around the core area at Mada'in Salih, Al-Khuraybah and Al-Ula Old Town, a ghost town labyrinth of stone and mudbrick houses which -- according to Foote -- was inhabited from at least the 12th century right up until the 1980s.

But the new survey extends to many areas that have never been studied, and involves the use of cutting-edge technology that is revolutionizing the field of archaeology.

Flying machines

Jamie Quartermaine, who is leading the survey in the core-area, is a pioneer in high-tech archaeology. ""The scale of the work we're doing wouldn't have been possible in the past, using conventional ground survey methods,"" he says.

The process begins with a flight in a light aircraft equipped with a scanner and camera. ""We take very detailed high-resolution photographs from the air,"" says Quartermaine. ""The camera captures objects four inches (10 cms) wide from altitudes up to 5,000 feet (1,500 meters)."" The scanners use LIDAR (light imaging, detection and ranging) technology to shoot laser beams to the ground and calculate the precise altitude of each survey point.

The photographic and LIDAR data is then combined to produce a 3D relief map. ""It's like GoogleEarth but with a much greater level of detail,"" says Quartermaine.

A drone takes photos of Al-Ula's archaeological sites.

Once he has identified promising sites, Quartermaine zooms in with drones fitted with powerful cameras. Finally, the team goes in by land. ""We use 4X4s to visit sites identified from the air to verify, describe, sketch and photograph them,"" he says.

Ground research, says Quartermaine, is the only way to see rock art and text found on vertical rock faces that are not visible from above. His team do not have the time or resources to translate the texts, which are written in numerous languages including Aramaic, Arabic, Nabataean, Greek and Latin. Others will do that later.

The rock art, however -- some of which pre-dates the written word -- is already yielding information. ""There are pictures of giraffes, ostriches, one elephant, lots of camels and hunting scenes, "" says Quartermaine.

The animals provide clues to the age of the artworks. ""The giraffes and ostriches date from the period before 6,000 BC, when those species lived here,"" he says. ""Climate change records show that after this time, the landscape transitioned from savannah to desert. As the environment dried up, these animals were driven south to their current range in Africa.""

Desert discoveries

The level of preservation in Al-Ula is ""staggering,"" says Quartermaine. In the desert, the remains have not been subjected to water erosion and with so many stones lying around, manmade structures haven't been dismantled for re-use, as often happens elsewhere.

The most commonly found structures in Al-Ula are cairns -- piles of stones that mark graves, sometimes surrounded by low circular or square drystone walls -- which are older than anyone expected.

""We don't have verified dates yet, but it looks as if some may date to at least 4,000 BC,"" says Foote, adding that some may even stretch back to the Neolithic period (10,000 to 4,500 BC). ""It's very exciting because it shows that the history of occupation of the area goes back much further than was known.""

Kennedy has been equally astonished by his discoveries in the hinterland. ""In 10 days of flying, we found around 4,000 sites,"" he says. Some graves in this area are unlike any that Kennedy had seen before, with triangular structures positioned to point towards cairns. Kennedy believes they are unique to Al-Ula. ""We don't know the significance of the shapes,"" he says.

Most enigmatic of all, though, are the ""gates"" -- stone structures that consist of short, wide walls linked by long parallel walls, which look like farm gates when viewed from above. Some in Al-Ula measure 650 feet (200 meters), the length of four Olympic swimming pools. Even larger ones are found elsewhere in the Kingdom.

""Gates are unique to Saudi Arabia. I've never seen anything remotely like them anywhere,"" says Kennedy. ""There are no entry points, and we don't know what they were used for,"" he says, adding that analysis of aerial photos and ground visits might help to reveal their purpose.

Will tourists come to Saudi?

When tourists arrive in Saudi Arabia, Al-Ula's standout attractions are likely to be Mada'in Salih, Al-Ula Old Town and Al-Khuraybah.

Al-Ula Old Town.

Saudi Arabia is collaborating with experts from around the world on the Al-Ula development and in April signed a 10-year deal with France that includes provisions for hotels, transport infrastructure and a world-class culture and art museum.

Al-Madani anticipates that 50% of visitors will come from Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region, the other 50% will be from overseas.

But will Saudi Arabia face challenges reconciling international tourism with its conservative Islamic population and values? It has been reported that only women over the age of 25 will be allowed to visit without a male chaperone, and they will be expected to cover their bodies in searing temperatures.

""I think they've got a problem selling Saudi Arabia in competition with, say, Jordan, which is a much more relaxed Middle Eastern society,"" says Neil Faulkner, an archaeologist and historian who leads tours to Jordan and Egypt.

Gina Morello, from Dallas, Texas, toured Saudi Arabia earlier this year -- entering the country on a business visa. She admits to some pre-trip nerves, especially around clothing rules. ""When I saw Western women ... they just had the abayas (long cloaks) on and no head scarf,"" she says, adding that she, too, did not don a headscarf for most of the trip. Wearing an abaya made her feel uncomfortable, however, because of the physical restriction and loss of identity.

""There just weren't a ton of women walking around,"" she says. But people were unexpectedly friendly and warm. ""In one park women wanted to take pictures with us ... doing selfies and the peace sign.""

Al Madani believes that travelers' inherent desire to experience new places will outweigh such concerns. ""Once here, people will enjoy our hospitality and authenticity, be accepting of the local traditions and customs and respect the norms and values of the communities they are engaging with.""

Faulkner says a second barrier is the perception of the Middle East as dangerous, unstable and potentially hostile to Western visitors. ""It has had a huge impact on cultural tourism across the region for the last 15 years,"" he says, adding that the tourist industry has declined even in relatively safe destinations. He believes that Saudi Arabia faces an uphill challenge, pointing to their involvement in the war in Yemen and long-running regional conflict with Iran.

""Security is, of course, an important element in anyone's decision to travel,"" says Al Madani, ""but there have been very few, if any, incidents affecting travelers or tourists in Saudi in recent years, and we will continue to work hard to ensure this remains so.""

Ultimately, he believes that Al-Ula's archaeological treasure trove is strong enough to draw crowds to a country that has long captured the world's imagination.",Is Saudi Arabia the next big heritage tourism destination?,http://cnn.com/2018/06/20/middleeast/saudi-archaeology/index.html

The National Disaster Management Authority launched initiatives in 2016 to target the issue

(CNN) The death toll from the intense heat that strikes India each year between March and July has dropped drastically over the past three years, according to the latest data from the National Disaster Management Authority.

In 2018, 13 people have died from exposure to extreme temperatures.

Just three years ago, in 2015, the figure was 2,422. Last year, the national toll was less than 250.

Heat waves have long plagued India and fueled a seasonal surge in deaths. There are more than 1.7 million homeless people on the streets, and fluctuating electricity supplies regularly affect temperature-control technologies, such as fans. Combined with poor access to drinking water, this means many people across the country succumb to extreme heat or cold.

Government agencies classify a heat wave by how far a day's temperature exceeds the average temperature for that time of year in a region. The Indian Meteorological Department has set the mark at about 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above the average temperature.

125,125,2018-05-15 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) With Tom Wolfe, the most important thing was what you didn't see. What you saw, of course, was the white suit. Perhaps no American writer in history was more identified with an article of clothing. The outfit -- flashy, unique, an unapologetic plea for attention -- seemed symbolic, too. Wolfe's writing, with its English teacher's nightmare of ALL CAPS and excessive use of exclamation points!!! -- stood out from the crowd as much as he did.

But to focus on the suit, or even the punctuation, was to miss the point of Wolfe's genius. He was, above all, a brilliant reporter -- a meticulous and patient observer of the chaotic world around him. Wolfe, who died Monday at 88 , was the rarest bird in American letters, a master of both nonfiction and fiction, an achievement that his distinctive plumage served sometimes to obscure.

Consider, for example, his 1979 masterpiece, "" The Right Stuff. "" The first American astronauts, from the Mercury program, were almost forgotten by the time Wolfe turned his eye to them. But by steeping himself in the material, Wolfe saw that the astronauts were not even the best story about the era. That role, and Wolfe's book, belonged to Chuck Yeager , the slow-talking West Virginian whose feats as a test pilot made the work of the astronauts (who were just ""spam in a can"") look small.

The phrase -- ""the right stuff"" -- has become such a cliché that it's easy to forget that Wolfe brought it to us, just a few decades ago.

The setting of "" The Bonfire of the Vanities "" -- the rarefied precincts of Manhattan's Upper East Side -- could not have differed more from the dusty Air Force bases of ""The Right Stuff."" But in that novel, published in 1987, Wolfe hilariously and wisely revealed both the upside and the underside of the Reagan years among the rich.

126,126,2018-06-23 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Las Vegas (CNN) In a visit to boost one of the nation's most vulnerable Republican senators ahead of this fall's November election, President Donald Trump unveiled a new nickname for the Democrat running to unseat Sen. Dean Heller.

""Wacky Jacky,"" Trump said at the Nevada GOP convention, in reference to Rep. Jacky Rosen. ""You don't want her as your senator.""

Trump's short Saturday swing through Las Vegas was aimed largely at bolstering Heller, who is running for re-election in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Just before his speech to the state GOP, he held a backstage fundraiser for Heller.

During the speech, Trump listed off several of his administration's accomplishments, notably the passage of tax cuts and repealing the individual mandate under Obamacare.

As controversy still rages over his administration's handling of immigrant families at the Southern border, Trump said he sees the issue as immigration as a winner for Republicans in the midterms.

""I think I got elected largely because we are strong on the border,"" Trump said.

Of undocumented immigrants, he said, ""if they see any weakness, they will come by the millions.""

Trump also noted that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a potential 2020 challenger, was in the state Saturday speaking at the state Democratic convention, again using the ""Pocahontas"" slur to describe the Massachusetts Democrat.

""Wacky Jacky is campaigning with Pocahontas, you believe this? In your state! Can you believe this?"" Trump said at the Nevada GOP convention. ""When you see that, that's not the senator you want.""

The President also mocked calls for an apology for using the term.

""To the memory of Pocahontas, I apologize,"" he said.

Rosen called Trump's Nevada trip Heller's reward for backing Trump's agenda.

""The President is attacking me with lies and petty insults because I'm not afraid to stand up to him,"" Rosen said in a statement. ""Dean Heller has been a rubber stamp for Donald Trump in Washington, caving to the President's divisive agenda at Nevada's expense. This was Senator Heller's reward for his loyalty.""

After the speech, Trump was headed to a roundtable with Heller, gubernatorial nominee Adam Laxalt, labor secretary Alex Acosta and local business leaders focused on the GOP's tax bill, for which Heller claimed credit.

The trip shows the extent to which Trump and Heller have repaired their relationship.

Heller was a Trump critic during the 2016 election. Last summer, he famously stood with Brian Sandoval, Nevada's popular outgoing moderate Republican governor, and declared his opposition to Trump's bill repealing parts of Obamacare.

The two broke the ice on an October flight to Las Vegas after the mass shooting there. Heller, meanwhile, has been a staunch advocate for Trump's other policies -- particularly tax reform.

Trump prodded Heller -- who famously helped tank Trump's effort to repeal Obamacare last summer -- saying his re-election bid was ""a little bit shaky at the beginning.""

That was, in part, because of the presence of conservative challenger Danny Tarkanian in the race.

At the urging of Trump and Trump's 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale, Tarkanian dropped out of that campaign to run for the 3rd District House seat instead.

During the speech, President also returned to his familiar criticism of Arizona Sen. John McCain, saying ""a little early-morning surprise by one of our own"" -- referring to McCain's dramatic thumbs-down vote on an Obamacare repeal bill -- tanked the effort to undo former President Barack Obama's signature legislation.

Since then, the tax bill repealed Obamacare's individual mandate, and the Trump administration is rolling back the law's other protections.

Trump repeatedly claimed that electing Rosen to the Senate amounts to backing House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

127,127,2018-06-14 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) ""Tag"" is, improbably, ""inspired by"" a true story, which adds zest to this screwball comedy. The creative liberties, however, quickly begin feeling less and less tethered to reality, yielding sporadic but diminishing bouts of just-okay fun that ultimately don't leave much of a mark, as the idea lacks the heft to sustain a whole movie.

Thanks to the cast -- headlined by Ed Helms, Jon Hamm and Jeremy Renner -- and the sheer goofiness of the premise, there are some very funny moments, including a certain level of ruthlessness and edge in the early going.

That's balanced, perhaps inevitably, against a soft underbelly -- built on the notion that playing a kids' game provides a bridge to the friendships enjoyed in youth. That's sweet, but also periodically violates the old ""Seinfeld"" ""no hugging, no learning"" rule.

The movie is derived from a Wall Street Journal article, about a group of 10 friends who -- for more than two decades -- devoted one month each year to playing ""tag,"" often going to elaborate lengths to fool their targets and dub them ""it.""

For movie purposes, the core group has been cut in half, and the action has been set against the backdrop of a wedding, as Hogan (Helms) rallies his buddies (Hamm, Hannibal Buress, ""New Girl's"" Jake Johnson) to try and finally tag Renner's Jerry, whose preternatural skill at the game has enabled him to elude them for all these years.

128,128,2018-02-20 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Those labels describe the three groups of seats in the House of Representatives that will likely determine control of the chamber in November's midterm election.

Virtually all analysts in both parties agree that the epicenter of vulnerability for the House Republican majority is in what could be called red pockets: These are the predominantly white-collar suburban seats the GOP still holds in big metropolitan areas that are otherwise solidly Democratic. Those include places such as Orange County, California; New Jersey; Miami; and suburbs outside of New York City, Chicago, Denver, Philadelphia and Minneapolis.

But even if Democrats make big gains in those districts, there aren't quite enough of them to provide the party with the net gain of 24 seats it needs to recapture the House. That means House Democrats would also need to make inroads into the two other large groups of vulnerable GOP seats.

One is what I call Romneyland: white-collar suburban seats in purple and even red states where Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, almost universally performed better than Donald Trump did in 2016.

The third are the ""blue-collar blues"": mostly blue-collar, non-urban seats in blue states, where Trump almost without exception improved on Romney's performance.

More distantly, the Democrats are also eyeing a few Republican-held blue-collar seats in purple and Republican-leaning states. But control of the House will likely turn on how the battle between the parties turns in the red pockets, Romneyland and the blue-collar blues.

The red pockets will likely be the most reliable source of gains for Democrats because they compound two sources of Republican vulnerability: They are white-collar districts in areas with large numbers of Democrats, who appear motivated to turn out at higher-than-usual levels next fall.

The big question is how far Democrats can reach into places where only one of those advantages is present: white-collar seats in traditionally Republican-leaning areas, or seats in Democratic states that are more rural and blue-collar.

JUST WATCHED Intel chiefs: Russia targeting 2018 elections Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Intel chiefs: Russia targeting 2018 elections 02:14

This battlefield reflects the long-term trends that have seen Democrats demonstrate increasing strength up and down the ballot in diverse, heavily college-educated, major metropolitan areas -- even in Republican-leaning states. In parallel, Republicans have established dominant control over preponderantly white non-metro and blue-collar areas, even in otherwise Democratic-leaning states.

All of these trends have accelerated under Trump. Amid improving attitudes toward the Republican tax bill, several recent polls have shown a small but measurable uptick in President Trump's job approval rating and a narrowing into the mid-single digits of the previously double-digit advantage Democrats have held in the ""generic"" ballot test of preferences for 2018.

But even with those shifts, polls still consistently find a deeply polarized electorate. Trump and the GOP retain solid support among white men without college degrees, if slightly less than they attracted in 2016. But they are facing intense resistance from younger and non-white voters -- especially African-Americans -- and much lower numbers than usual among college-educated whites, especially, but not exclusively, women.

White women without a college education, whose support was critical to Trump's 2016 victory, loom as a wild card: Polls find they have cooled on him, but Democrats still face many obstacles with them.

These diverging demographic attitudes shape the geography of the 2018 battlefield.

Red pockets

The clearest opportunity for Democrats is the relatively few remaining Republican-held districts in blue metro areas with large populations of college-educated whites, and in many cases substantial minority and youth populations as well. These are places crowded with voters who tilt toward liberal positions on social issues and recoil from Trump's volatile persona, particularly the way he talks about race.

The renewed visibility of gun control issues after the horrific Parkland, Florida, massacre could provide Democrats another lever in these districts, since the Republicans in them have almost universally voted with the National Rifle Association to loosen gun regulations in recent years.

These ""red pockets"" include the four seats Republicans control in Orange County -- the districts held by Mimi Walters and Dana Rohrabacher and the open seats that will be vacated by Darrell Issa and Ed Royce -- as well as their sole remaining seat in Los Angeles County, held by Steve Knight.

Others that fit this description include the seats in the western Chicago suburbs held by Republican Peter Roskam and in the eastern Denver suburbs held by Mike Coffman; the three suburban Philadelphia seats held by Ryan Costello, Mike Fitzpatrick and Pat Meehan (who has announced he will not seek re-election amid a sex scandal); the northern Virginia seat held by Barbara Comstock; two open seats in New Jersey as well as the one defended by Rep. Leonard Lance; Lee Zeldin's seat in eastern Long Island; the suburban Minneapolis seats now held by Jason Lewis and Erik Paulsen; the Seattle-area seat that Dave Reichert is leaving; as well as the Miami-area seat being vacated by Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and the nearby seat held by Rep. Carlos Curbelo.

Though Romney carried many of these seats -- often narrowly -- in 2012, Hillary Clinton won all of those listed above in 2016 except for the seats held by Lewis and Fitzpatrick, which Trump won by eyelash margins, and Zeldin's, which Trump won more comfortably. These resemble the places where Democrats showed the most dramatic gains in 2017, for instance in their sweep of legislative seats and the huge margins they generated in the governor's race in northern Virginia.

Compounding the GOP's vulnerability, the new congressional map the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued Monday, after earlier ruling that the current district lines represented an impermissible gerrymander, strengthened the Democrats' hand in all three suburban Philadelphia seats.

For Republicans, the key in these booming districts will be whether the good economy helps them recapture voters recoiling from Trump's personal behavior. One complication is these blue-state upper-middle-class suburbs are among the most likely losers from the GOP tax plan, which limits the deductibility of mortgage interest and state and local taxes. Democrats are highly unlikely to win back the House without maximizing their gains in the red pockets.

Romneyland

The next bucket of seats is demographically similar to the red pockets but politically distinct because they are in metro areas that lean much more reliably toward the GOP.

I call this group of seats Romneyland because they are filled with voters who resemble Romney demographically and ideologically: professionals and corporate middle managers who want a president who will shrink government and even pursue a center-right social agenda, but also exude professionalism and decorum.

Romney won virtually every seat in this category in 2012. In 2016, Trump lost ground relative to Romney in almost all of them, though the residual Republican strength was great enough that he still carried many, albeit often narrowly.

The districts in this bucket include the Omaha-area seat held by Don Bacon; the seats in suburban Houston and outside Dallas held by John Culberson and Pete Sessions, respectively; the two suburban Atlanta seats held by Karen Handel and Rob Woodall; David Young's seat outside Des Moines; the Tucson-area seat Martha McSally is vacating to run for the Senate from Arizona; the Lexington, Kentucky-area seat held by Andy Barr; the seats outside Detroit that Dave Trott is vacating and Mike Bishop is defending; and Kevin Yoder's seat in suburban Kansas City, Kansas.

These seats are not immune from the forces threatening the Republicans in the red pockets: Handel, for instance, only narrowly survived last June's special election in Georgia, though her predecessor Tom Price had carried over 60% of the vote there as recently as 2016.

But as Handel's slim victory over Democrat Jon Ossoff showed, Republicans have more of a cushion in these places than in the red pockets. That's partly because more of the white-collar whites in them are social conservatives than their counterparts in the Democratic-leaning metro areas.

Blue-collar blues

The third key test for Democrats is the districts I call ""blue-collar blues."" These are the blue-collar, exurban, small town and rural seats in states that generally lean Democratic.

These include Republican seats held by John Faso, John Katko and Claudia Tenney in upstate New York; Mike Bost, Rodney Davis and Randy Hultgren in downstate Illinois; the northeast Iowa seat of Rod Blum; Bruce Poliquin's northern Maine district; and the Central Valley, California, seats of Jeff Denham and David Valadao.

JUST WATCHED Dems flip deep-red Missouri state House seat Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dems flip deep-red Missouri state House seat 01:53

These seats present an especially revealing test for Democrats. Former President Barack Obama carried almost all of them at least once and many of them have elected Democratic House members in the recent past. But House Democrats were routed in these places in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections under Obama, and almost all of these districts turned further toward Trump in 2016.

The 2017 results in Virginia and Alabama showed Democrats almost completely failing to crack the GOP's hold on blue-collar and rural voters. But some Democrats argue that terrain is much tougher for the party in the South than in the Northeastern and Midwestern states where these competitive House seats are concentrated.

Democrats see an opening in polling, such as the 2017 average of Gallup's daily approval ratings for Trump, that shows a significant erosion in his support across the Rust Belt among working-class white women, even as he remains very strong among blue-collar white men. Converting that female disillusionment with Trump into votes for Democratic congressional candidates is likely the key to seriously contesting the ""blue-collar blue"" seats.

One early test will be March's special election in the heavily blue-collar southwestern Pennsylvania district that Republican Rep. Tim Murphy has vacated: Democrat Conor Lamb, a former Marine, is running competitively against Republican state Rep. Rick Saccone in a district Trump carried by nearly 20 percentage points.

Beyond the top-tier targets in the red pockets, there's a spirited behind-the-scenes debate among Democratic strategists about which of the remaining two buckets of seats represents the party's best opportunity in 2018.

Some focus most on winning back working-class voters in blue states, who have a recent history of voting for the party but are more favorable to Trump. Others see more opportunity to convert white-collar suburbanites in red states, who have a longer history of voting Republican but are also more disaffected from the President.

To recapture the House, Democrats will likely need to do a considerable amount of both.

He speaks at some length about his upbringing, and his initial reluctance to marry his wife, Aja Volkman, because she wasn't Mormon, which meant departing from the marry-within-the-faith path followed by his brothers.

Still, it's Reynolds' awakening regarding the church's hostility to gay marriage, and promotion of ""solutions"" like ""mixed-orientation marriages"" (prodding gay and lesbian members to wed straight people of the opposite gender) and celibacy, which prompts him to stay and fight rather than simply leave.

""Believer"" (a name that doubles as the title of one of the group's hits) zeroes in on the toll of those policies, starting with an alarmingly high suicide rate among gay teens in the church's home state of Utah. Those testimonials -- in some instances from grieving parents -- are devastating.

133,133,2018-06-20 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Australians trust US President Donald Trump less than Chinese President Xi Jinping, and many view Trump's presidency as a ""critical"" threat to their country, according to a national survey published Wednesday.

It follows a tumultuous year for Australia's foreign relations which saw the relationship with both Washington and Beijing fluctuate amid a changing power dynamic in Asia.

Relations between Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and the newly elected US leader got off to a shaky start following a heated first phone cal l, while concerns over Chinese interference in Australian politics frayed ties with Beijing towards the end of 2017.

""The fluctuation with the United States stems from a disappointment -- one is our ally and one isn't and I suspect our expectations are higher with the US. When we hit a rocky patch in relations between the US and Australia, or their leaders, that puts us on edge,"" Lowy Institute's Director of Research Alex Oliver said.

The new survey shows only 55% of adults surveyed trust the US to ""act responsibly in the world,"" a 28-point drop from 2011 and the lowest percentage ever recorded in the survey.

Beijing in comparison was ranked almost equal to America, with 52% of respondents trusting both countries equally. The UK, Japan, France and India all had higher levels of trust in Australia than both countries.

Perhaps even more worrying for the United States is that 42% of Australians said ""Trump's presidency"" is a critical threat to their country -- higher than foreign political interference (41%), migration (40%) and China's growing power (36%).

Although the Lowy Institute didn't ask Australians about their confidence in former US President Barack Obama during his time in office, Oliver said he was very popular across the country.

""In our 2015 survey he was the most admired leader, amongst a group of leaders which included Pope Francis, Angela Merkel and Hillary Clinton,"" she said.

Concerns over political interference

Almost one-in-three of those surveyed were concerned about China's influence in Australia's political processes, a topic which has received a lot of attention since December.

At the end of last year, Prime Minister Turnbull announced sweeping legislation to crack down on foreign interference in Australia, after an opposition Labor Party senator was forced to resign over accusations of undue influence from Beijing.

But Oliver pointed out that Australians' impressions of Beijing were actually mostly unchanged despite the huge emphasis placed on interference in recent months.

""Sentiments to China haven't shifted since last year, so despite this debate and despite China's apparent umbrage at Australia for taking too firm a stance on foreign interference, it hasn't affected ordinary Australians' feelings,"" she said.

In fact, almost an equal number of Australians are concerned over US influence in the country, 58% of those surveyed compared to 63% worried about Chinese influence.

The survey shows Australians are also concerned about the level of Chinese investment in the country. Seventy-two percent of adults said the government allowed ""too much investment from China,"" up from 56% in 2014.

However the survey noted Australians believe ""that China represents more of an opportunity than a threat, and that Australia should be able to maintain good relationships with China and the United States at the same time.""

Eighty-two percent saw China more as an economic partner than a military threat, and despite Trump's unpopularity, over three quarters of respondents supported the US alliance. Fifty-five percent said they viewed China as the world's leading economic power.

""They're wary of (Beijing) in a number of respects, but that doesn't dent the confidence this is an important relationship,"" Oliver said.","Australians trust Xi Jinping more than Donald Trump, survey shows",http://cnn.com/2018/06/20/australia/lowy-survey-australia-us-china-intl/index.html
134,134,2018-01-09 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Congressional Republicans spent last weekend huddling with President Trump at Camp David to frame their legislative agenda in 2018. But they have already placed the bets most likely to determine their fate in November's midterm election, as a series of dramatic events late last week demonstrated.

Two of their biggest decisions over the past year already loom over the upcoming election.

The first has been to align more closely with Trump even as questions have mounted about both his basic fitness for the presidency and the potential legal exposure that he and his inner circle might face in the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller. The second has been to pursue a policy agenda, on issues from taxes to health care to the environment, aimed almost entirely at the preferences of their party's conservative base, with strikingly few concessions to any voices or interests beyond their core coalition.

Before November, the GOP might modulate each of these choices. But Republicans have engraved the fundamental outline of each direction so deeply over the past year that they are unlikely to be significantly altered.

The decisions to increasingly lock arms with Trump and to pursue such a partisan agenda reflect the same political calculation. On each front, Republicans are placing the highest priority on maximizing unity and enthusiasm among their base voters -- even at the price of infuriating and energizing Democrats, and antagonizing more swing voters -- especially suburban college-educated whites. For voters anywhere on the continuum from ambivalent to alarmed about Trump, congressional Republicans are now sending a clear signal that they are far more inclined to empower than to constrain him.

""During the campaign, they were making a bet -- and it's clear that it's a misplaced bet -- that once Trump became president they could control him and contain him and he would somehow rise above what he was during the campaign,"" said Pete Wehner, the director of strategic initiatives in the George W. Bush White House. ""And it's been the opposite. Once they made that deal with the figurative devil, they were stuck. They are on the train and they don't think they can get off.""

JUST WATCHED Trump's 2017 victories and missteps Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump's 2017 victories and missteps 09:24

A succession of rapid-fire events late last week encapsulated each of the GOP's two key wagers.

Last Thursday morning came widespread excerpts from the scabrous new book by Michael Wolff, ""Fire and Fury: Inside the White House,"" that alleged virtually all of the administration's officials privately mock Trump's capacity and despair over his impulsiveness and refusal to process almost any information they present him. Both Trump and the White House have dismissed the claims. But the charges -- deepened when Wolff's full book was released Friday and he appeared in his first television interviews -- underscored the President's greatest political vulnerability: the conclusion among many voters that he is not equipped -- by judgment, temperament, values or experience -- to meet the demands of his office.

A few hours after Wolff's first revelations came another body blow: the report last Thursday night by The New York Times that Trump, through his White House counsel Donald McGahn, had pressured Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself in the Russia probe. That reporting underscored the president's potential legal vulnerability to charges of obstruction of justice in Mueller's probe. So did a succession of spectacular charges in Wolff's book, including a report that Trump personally directed the misleading statement about the meeting of his son Donald Trump Jr. and other top advisers with Russians offering ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton in June 2016.

CNN has not independently verified all of the details in Wolff's book.

Any of these revelations might have been expected to provoke alarms from congressional Republicans. But no leading Republican raised an eyebrow about the accusations in Wolff's book. And bookended around the reports of White House pressure on Sessions, House and Senate Republicans each pushed to intensify investigations not against Trump but rather the authors of the ""dossier"" that initially raised charges of Russian meddling and connections with his campaign.

On Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan sided with House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, a fierce Trump defender, in demanding new documents from the Justice Department outlining how it handled the dossier. And on Friday, Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham further raised the stakes by asking the Justice Department to open a criminal investigation against Christopher Steele, the former British spy who authored the dossier.

This push to shift the investigative focus from Trump to his critics followed the broader direction among congressional Republicans, who are embracing the President more unreservedly, and defending him more reflexively, than they did when he took office.

""It seems to me a pretty bottomless well,"" said Wehner, now a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, and a frequent Trump critic. ""If there is some line Trump can cross that can cause them to stand up to him, we haven't seen it.""

Sandwiched between the release of Wolff's excerpts and the McGahn reporting, the Trump administration issued a major policy announcement that helps explain that evolution. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke announced that the administration intends to open virtually all of the country's coastal waters to offshore drilling by oil companies. The plan proposed 47 lease sales over the next five years covering some 1.5 billion acres of offshore waters. In each case that was more than even President Ronald Reagan and his controversial interior secretary, James Watt, proposed in 1982 (41 lease sales and about 1 billion acres), before a bipartisan coalition in Congress forced them to retrench their plans in a landmark political battle of that era.

JUST WATCHED Trump plans to roll back offshore drilling ban Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump plans to roll back offshore drilling ban 00:41

The offshore oil announcement fit the clear policy pattern of Trump's first year: It granted virtually every wish of a key component in the GOP coalition -- in this case the oil industry -- with virtually no concession to any interests outside that coalition, from environmentalists to the mostly Democratic governors of coastal states. The same uncompromising pattern has been evident in Trump's efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act; the administration's moves to rescind an array of Obama-era environmental and consumer safety regulations; Trump's succession of highly ideological federal judicial nominations; and the recently passed tax bill, which not only directed the vast majority of its benefits to the highest earners but also punished Democratic-leaning states by limiting the deductibility of state and local taxes. (For that reason, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo last week called the tax plan ""economic civil war."")

On elements of his America First nationalism -- particularly his skepticism about trade, legal immigration and foreign alliances -- Trump may eventually spark more resistance from mainstream Republicans and their allied business interests. But so far his willingness to advance so many long-standing conservative causes has clearly encouraged more Republicans initially skeptical about his fitness to lash themselves more tightly to his turbulent presidency.

""You would have to say that the tax cut/corporate wing of the party has gotten what it signed up for and the social conservatives have certainly gotten what they signed up for,"" says William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former deputy domestic policy adviser to President Bill Clinton. ""And the portion of the agenda that is being pursued through administrative action, rather than legislation, is very much in line with what a more traditional Republican conservative would have done. ... The coalition as it existed before Trump came on the scene is getting paid off big time.""

Given the policy rewards, both Wehner and Galston are dubious that almost any provocation from Trump could cause either congressional Republicans or the broader conservative movement to establish more independence from him, unless voters send a clear message of discontent in 2018.

This approach increases the odds that the core Republican coalition will remain united heading into 2018 but magnifies the risk of alienating voters beyond it. Polls have shown that cornerstones of the Trump agenda -- led by the ACA repeal and the tax bill -- face enormous resistance from Democrats and independents. It was revealing that neither the ACA repeal effort, nor, even more remarkably, the tax cut bill, could draw support from a single Democrat in either chamber -- even though 10 Senate Democrats are seeking re-election in states Trump carried in 2016.

Even more important, surveys have consistently found that Trump's performance in office has convinced a solid majority of Americans that he lacks the temperament , skills and even stability they expect in a president. By choosing not to provide any meaningful check or oversight on Trump, congressional Republicans risk convincing those dubious voters that the only way to constrain the president is through a Democratic-led Congress. Indeed, in a December national Quinnipiac Poll 56% of Americans said they believed Trump is not qualified to serve as president -- and fully 83% of those critics said they intended to vote Democratic for Congress.

""What's happened now is a strong majority of the country has decided that they deeply oppose Donald Trump, and it's not based primarily on policy,"" notes Wehner. ""It's based primarily on their judgment that he's not fit to be president. The Republican Party is in a position of standing there and making the opposite argument -- and there's going to be a price for that.""",Republicans have already made their 2018 bets,http://cnn.com/2018/01/09/politics/republicans-2018-election-congress-midterm-trump/index.html

(CNN) During the presidential campaign, when Donald Trump recited his favorite riff: ""Build the wall,"" I would always advise him, ""Make sure that wall has big gates for immigrants to enter legally.""

Over the next few weeks, Congress has some big decisions to make on immigration, and this comes at a time when both parties seem to be leaning in the wrong direction.

Democrats are, well, for lack of a better word, stonewalling on building the wall. They say it's an ineffective way to stop illegal crossings, and they may be right. But they miss the point. For millions of Americans the wall is seen as the fulfillment of a promise: Washington will take border security seriously for the first time in decades.

On some of their stances, they risk the possibility that voters will think they care more about undocumented immigrants than American workers. That's not a winning position with voters.

Some Democrats also are in favor of allowing immigrants to get broad use of public benefits -- food stamps, public housing, free college tuition, Medicaid and the like (although undocumented immigrants currently aren't able to qualify for welfare or food stamps).

For 200 years, immigrants have been coming to the United States ‎without receiving welfare. In fact they could be denied entry if the immigration officials believed they would become a "" public charge ."" Wave after wave of the foreign born have done magnificently well by pulling themselves up by their bootstraps.

Many Republicans are also making a mistaken plea to reduce not just illegal immigration but also to lower the number of legal immigrant visas.

Why? Almost every economic analysis finds that legal immigrants are net contributors to the economy. Not all immigrants are beneficial, and sure there are bad apples in the bunch. But the benefits of immigration are surprisingly large -- mostly because most immigrants are risk-takers who come to the United States between the ages of 16 and 40 -- so they tend to be at the start of their working years or at the peak of their earning years.

The net benefits to American citizens in terms of growing the economy and paying taxes is in the trillions of dollars over the next 30 to 40 years when you include Social Security payments. So if the GOP wants to be a growth party, it must be a pro-immigration party. Period.

Within the conservative movement, alas, there is a new neo-Malthusian strain of people who believe we have to worry about exploding population growth and limited resources. Ridiculous. US birth rates just hit a 30-year low, and without immigration we would have negative population growth and we'd soon look like aging Japan. Immigration is America's fountain of youth.

My view is that with the graying of the population and the low birth rates, we should allow about 1.5 million legal immigrants into the United States each year (we are now at about 1 million per year ). We should change the selection process to a merit-based policy along the lines of what Trump has endorsed and that has been adopted in Canada and Australia.

Immediate family members, children and spouses would still go to the front of the line.

This would ensure that we get the best, brightest and hardest-working -- regardless of race, ethnicity or nation of origin. If we did so, we would never in this century have to worry about China overtaking the United States as a world superpower. We would import all their brainiacs as well as the most talented and skilled from the countries with which we compete.

Most importantly, there should be no welfare benefits for immigrants until they become citizens. That's the deal. To the immigrants we say: We will give you the greatest asset in the world -- a US passport allowing you to share in our freedoms and our wonderland of opportunity -- but you can't live on the dole. You and your sponsors are responsible for your well-being.

With entitlement spending exploding, and trillions of dollars of future deficits in these programs, we can't afford to allow foreigners to come to America to collect our generous benefits. ‎We now have fairly strong evidence that welfare has the same debilitating dependency effects on ‎immigrants as it does on the native born -- it saps them of their economic drive, which is the very attribute that makes immigrants such valuable assets in the first place.

To recap: We need to build the wall to signal the importance of border security. We need to allow more, not fewer legal immigrants. We need to shift toward a system that admits those with special skills and talents. And we need to disqualify legal immigrants from expensive welfare programs so that they do not become a cost to American citizens.

To get such a deal done, Democrats have to get tougher on illegal immigrants, and Republicans have to allow more visas each year. There's a win-win for immigrants and the American economy here if Congress can just put partisan politics aside for a week or two and do what's right for the country.","Yes to immigration, no to welfare",http://cnn.com/2018/05/24/opinions/yes-to-immigration-no-to-welfare-opinion-moore/index.html
137,137,2018-06-20 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Moscow, Russia (CNN) Nigeria's World Cup side have lost out on more than $300k promised to them by government officials and sponsors after last Saturday's 2-0 defeat against Croatia.

A Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) spokesman told CNN that the federation had approved bonus amounts of $10K to be paid to each of the players if they had won the game.

Ademola Olajire said: ""Yes, the Super Eagles were to earn $10,000 each. It was meant to be their winning bonus for the game.""

There were widespread reports in Nigeria Tuesday that the country's sports minister had promised to increase their bonus by $5,000 per player if they won their next game against Iceland.

However his aide, Nneka Anibeze, told CNN that the reports were incorrect, adding that he had only promised the additional amount for their opening match, which they failed to win.

The team's loss against Croatia meant they also lost out on another $50,000 promised to them by the federation sponsor Aiteo, while Nigeria's Senate President Bukola Saraki also promised the team another $50,000 for all games won, according to NFF president Amaju Pinnick.

Reports from local media also said Saraki had gifted the team an additional $50,000 ahead of their departure to Russia.

Bonus controversy

Bonus payments have been an issue of controversy within the Nigeria squad and some other African countries in the past.

Nigerian players have battled with the NFF leadership over very long delays in paying out bonuses especially in the qualification games leading to major tournaments.

The fight culminated in a series of strikes by players at the start of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

Ghana's Black Stars made global headlines for the wrong reasons at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil after their fight with their federation over monies owed.

The disagreement forced FIFA to intervene by making advance payments to the Ghana FA to allow them to pay the players their bonus and put the media focus back on the pitch rather than the fights for cash.

In the case of Nigeria, the government was forced to send a delegation carrying dollars in cash to pay the players on the eve of their game with France.

The Super Eagles eventually lost the game and crashed out of the World Cup in 2014.

The current NFF leadership say they have learned the painful lessons from the events in the Nigerian and Ghanaian camps and ensured that cash issues were sorted out way ahead of the 2018 World Cup.

NFF president Pinnick explained to CNN that they signed an agreement on the bonus sharing formula with the players last year and also paid their share of FIFA's qualifying bonus upfront to avoid any disagreements.

""We are confident now that without any distraction, the players can concentrate with Nigerians and fans of the Eagles see the most organized outing so far,"" Pinnick told CNN.

After the players signed the bonus and allowances agreement with the NFF last year, team captain Mikel Obi told the federation's official website, thenff.com : ""We are very happy and excited with this development. This is the first time since I started playing for the senior team that I would see everything regarding preparation and bonuses and allowances put down in black and white and a binding agreement executed.

""It is reassuring that we now have a Federation leadership so committed to making everything work that they arranged this meeting and allowed the players to contribute and then set out to sign the agreement.""

Fans disappointed

Fans have however been disappointed with the Nigerian team's performance in their opening game against Croatia, which they lost 2-0 because of an own goal and a penalty.

138,138,2018-06-24 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) In many parts of the United States, this weekend marks the start of summer sleepaway camp season, which means swimming, arts and crafts, marshmallow roasts -- and, very often, ticks.

Of the more than 1,600 overnight camps that are members of the American Camp Association , more than a third are in New England and the mid-Atlantic states, where Lyme disease is particularly prevalent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

According to a May CDC report , cases of vector-borne diseases -- those caused by viruses and bacteria carried by ticks, mosquitoes and other bugs -- tripled in the United States from 2004 to 2016.

For years, experts have voiced concern that many local public health agencies are unprepared to control such pests and limit the spread of these diseases which include Lyme disease, dengue fever and Zika.

""I started to look into it, and the numbers were on the increase and didn't show any signs of stopping,"" said Lauren Rutkowski, who with her husband, Joel, owns Indian Head Camp for children in Equinunk, Pennsylvania. ""As a mom and a camp director, I was concerned.""

Every summer from 2010 to 2014, seven or eight campers had confirmed or suspected tick bites at Indian Head, and each summer, three or four of those children tested positive for Lyme disease, according to Rutkowski. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection transmitted through bites from infected ticks, and if left untreated, it can spread to joints, the heart and the nervous system.

She said it's not known whether the children contracted the disease from the tick bite they got at camp or from a previous tick bite at home.

In 2014, her son, Oakley, was bitten by a tick at the family's camp, which hosts 650 children every summer. He did not contract Lyme disease.

The next year, Rutkowski hired a new service that helps fight ticks, including spraying the perimeter of the camp with pesticides and offering advice on how to get rid of habitats where ticks breed.

Since then, not a single camper is known to have been bitten by a tick, Rutkowski said.

Now, 123 camps use the service, Ivy Oaks Analytics, according to Isaiah Ham, who started the company after one of his summer campers contracted Lyme disease from a tick bite.

Ham, then a college student working as a counselor, said he wasn't pleased with the camp's response.

""The camp just kind of shrugged and thought it was just inevitable, like a hurricane; it was just part of being in the outdoors,"" Ham remembered.

It's unknown how many children are bitten by ticks at summer camps or how many camps are using services to mitigate the pests, according to Sam Borek, president of the New York/New Jersey section of the American Camp Association.

Camps don't exist in a vacuum, of course, and there are concerns that state public health departments aren't doing enough to fight diseases caused by ticks, mosquitoes and other pests.

""Mosquitoes, ticks, fleas can all carry very serious diseases that are life-threatening,"" said Dr. Irwin Redlener, a professor at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.

A report from the National Association of County and City Health Officials says 84% of programs to control diseases from mosquitoes need improvement. In 18 states, every program is falling short.

These programs often aren't well-funded and aren't equipped to do proper surveillance or prevention, Redlener said.

""We're, simply put, not ready, and we should be,"" he said.

Redlener and other experts have criticized President Trump for ignoring climate change, part of the reason for the proliferation of pests that carry diseases.

""We have to wonder why the president and the administration [are] not taking this issue more seriously,"" he said.

The White House declined to comment on climate change, referring questions to the CDC , which makes clear on its website that climate change increases the number and geographic range of disease-carrying insects and ticks.

The White House statement also said the President takes such diseases seriously, requesting more than $49 million to fight them next year, an increase of $11 million over this year.

Back at Indian Head Camp, as the campers arrive on Saturday, they're hoping for another summer without a tick bite.

139,139,2018-06-21 00:00:00,cnn.com,"As a pediatric emergency medicine physician, she has seen young children recovering from life-threatening injuries and histories of abuse.

Yet in the past several weeks, when three toddlers were brought to Neubrand on separate occasions for medical care, they each were unlike any case she had ever seen, she said.

The children, ages 1 and 2, recently had been separated from their parents at the US-Mexico border and were placed in the care of foster families.

Neubrand treated the children at a hospital where she works in Colorado, hundreds of miles from the border.

""All the foster families told me the kids had been with them two weeks or less, and the reasons they brought them in were all pretty mild illnesses,"" such as rashes or upper respiratory infections, Neubrand said Wednesday.

However, ""if their behavior hadn't been so abnormal and I hadn't started asking questions about their background, I may not have known anything about their back story,"" she said of the children.

""They were the opposite of stable. Emotionally stable kids don't act the way these kids were acting,"" she said.

Foster mom: 'I'm just trying to not ruin his life'

The three toddlers -- two from Guatemala and one from Honduras -- left such a lasting impression on Neubrand that she wrote about them in a Facebook post on Monday, which garnered more than 5,000 reactions and more than 6,500 shares.

She wrote about how the children clung to their foster parents and did not try to explore the world around them, as many wide-eyed toddlers tend to do. The children also never spoke to or communicated with Neubrand, a fluent Spanish speaker. That's not unusual, she said. What was disconcerting was their physical behavior.

They ""could not be put down by their foster parents at all. Not just in the ER but also at home,"" she said. ""They were clearly trying to find literally anyone to hold on to.""

One child, a little girl, would latch her tiny fingers onto her foster mother so tightly that it was difficult for the woman to put the child down, even for a bath, Neubrand said.

""She was asking if I had any suggestions about better ways to bathe her. She was sponge-bathing her. She was doing the best she could do. It was just so heartbreaking that was going on,"" Neubrand said.

Another child, a little boy, constantly cried out for his father, Neubrand said.

""One of the moms told me that the little one, all day long, would just yell 'Papi, Papi, Papi.' She would try to tell him 'It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.' He just kept calling out,"" Neubrand said.

""She just kept saying to me, 'I'm just trying to not ruin his life. I'm just trying to not ruin his life.' She was clearly doing her best, but this kid wanted his dad.""

None of the three foster families spoke any Spanish, and they were unable to communicate with the toddlers, Neubrand said.

'From a medical standpoint, it was not safe'

Other than where the children were from and knowing that the parents were in custody of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Neubrand and the foster parents were not given much information about the children, and they had no medical history information.

""From a medical standpoint, it was not safe,"" Neubrand said.

On Wednesday, the American Medical Association sent a public letter to the Trump administration, urging the federal government to withdraw its ""zero tolerance"" policy on separating migrating families from their parents and caregivers.

""The Administration's 'zero tolerance' policy was a topic recently discussed at the AMA's Annual Meeting, which includes delegates representing over 170 state and national specialty medical societies,"" Dr. James Madara, CEO and executive vice president of the association, wrote.

""During this meeting we heard from delegates that the Administration's policy will do great harm to children and their parents or caregivers, who felt compelled to make a dangerous and uncertain journey because of safety concerns in their own countries,"" he wrote.

The new practice, however, does not address what happens to children who were separated from their parents over the past two months and who are probably now in the custody of a different government agency.

Here's the key bit:

""Clinton is starring in the Republican Party's 2018 midterm strategy. With no Democrat to attack in the White House for the first time in nearly a decade, Republicans are betting big that the ghost of Clinton will serve them well in 2018.

""Even if she avoids the spotlight moving forward, the Republican Party plans to evoke her early and often in key congressional races, particularly in regions Trump won, which feature most of the midterm season's competitive races.""

And, there's some evidence to back up the Clinton focus within the GOP. Witness the new ad by Don Blankenship , a Republican candidate for Senate in West Virginia.

""We don't need to investigate our president,"" says the ad's narrator . ""We need to arrest Hillary.""

It's not clear what Blankenship wants to arrest Clinton for -- email server? Uranium One deal? -- just that he wants to make sure she is incarcerated.

There's a BIG difference between Republican candidates and committees running ads featuring Clinton and those ads actually working to turn the 2018 midterm election into a referendum on the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.

The former could well happen. What special elections since Trump's 2016 victory have shown is that the Democratic base is hugely energized -- largely by their dislike for Trump and their disgust with the decisions he has made as president. Meanwhile, the Republican base is fat and happy; their side control the White House, the Senate, the House, the majority of governor's mansions and the majority of state legislatures in the country.

That sort of disparity in energy between the two party bases is bad news for the side suffering from the passion deficit. Midterm elections tend to be battles between the bases so if one side is much more enthusiastic, it can lead to major seat losses for the other side.

How do you motivate the GOP base? You find the equivalent of Donald Trump for the left. The problem, of course, is that there is no equivalent on the right for how the left regards Donald Trump. Trump is president. Hillary Clinton is a private citizen. It's just not the same.

Which doesn't mean, of course, that raising the specter of Clinton in ads won't work for some Republican candidates hoping to rev up the base. Republicans loathe Clinton and some -- many -- could have a Pavlovian reaction to the mention of her name and a picture of her on their TV screen. (In a September 2017 CNN national poll conducted by SSRS, 91% of Republicans had an unfavorable impression of Clinton; her overall unfavorable rating was 52%.)

The problem with the we-will-make-this-election-all-about-Hillary logic is that it has no logical end. Clinton isn't in office. She isn't in charge of much of anything. She will not run again for any national office and she likely wouldn't win if she did.

How, then, do you raise the stakes of voting for a Democrat who is in the same party as Clinton? Like, if, say, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin gets re-elected in West Virginia, is he going to somehow find a way to install Clinton as president or work to enact her agenda? Um, no.

History tells us that midterm elections are always a referendum on the president and his party. Since World War I, there have been only three elections -- 1934, 1998 and 2002 -- in which the president's party has not lost seats in a midterm election. In all three of those cases, there was a cataclysmic event that intervened: The Great Depression, Bill Clinton's impeachment and the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, respectively.

Short of something that major happening, the Republican Party is assured of losing seats in the House this fall -- the only question is whether they lose the 23 that would reinstall Democrats to the majority.

The reality is that voters make decisions based on the politicians in office, the elected officials who can impact their lives -- often, in their mind, in a negative way. Clinton simply isn't that. She is gone from office, never to return. Whether or not she is a visible presence on the campaign trail or fundraising circuit this fall -- my guess is she might do some money raising but isn't likely to be a hot commodity on the stump -- won't change the fact that she's out of office, and staying there.

143,143,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) Recep Tayyip Erdogan was already modern Turkey's longest serving ruler. Sunday's election result is an endorsement of the President's increasingly hardline measures that will raise alarm bells in the corridors of Western powers.

Other leaders, from Russia's Vladimir Putin to Somalia's Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, were quick to congratulate the former footballer and Istanbul mayor on his win.

""The winners of the June 24 elections are Turkey, the Turkish nation, sufferers of our region and all oppressed (people) in the world,"" Erdogan said in his victory speech. But what do the election results really mean?

Erdogan tightens his grip

Erdogan starts a new five-year term as president with sweeping new powers granted in a narrowly-won referendum last year that was denounced by his critics as a blatant power grab.

Under the new system, the office of prime minister is abolished, parliament's powers are curtailed, and the president is accorded wide-ranging executive authority. Erdogan will also be able to stand for another term, meaning he could be in office until 2028.

Erdogan has consolidated power at every step of his career. He has crushed anti-government protests, and in 2013 he evaded a corruption investigation into his inner circle. After a failed military coup to remove his government from power in 2016, he eliminated his opponents by firing tens of thousands of government workers, gutting public institutions, jailing critical voices, and clamping down on the media.

Bad news for the opposition

The opposition gave it their best shot, but in the end were disappointed at the ballot box. However, in spite of Erdogan's near-silencing of opposition, almost half of Turks who cast ballots voted against him. That means they still have a voice in parliament, and the hope for the opposition is the momentum gained during the election campaign will continue.

A mixed result for the Kurds

The Turkish army has been fighting the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), deemed a terrorist organization by the US, EU and others, for nearly four decades, and Erdogan's AKP has ruled out returning to a peace process that collapsed in 2015.

Despite the resounding victory of their arch foe in Sunday's elections, in many Kurdish villages there were still celebrations. The Kurdish-oriented Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) passed the 10% threshold to enter parliament, scuppering Erdogan's plans to exclude Kurdish representation there.

This was achieved despite Selahattin Demirtas, the party's presidential candidate, being in prison on flimsy terrorism charges, and an election campaign when not a day went by without some form of violent attack against the HDP.

Further blow to freedom of expression

A stifling climate of fear has enveloped Turkey's media landscape. According to Amnesty International, more than 120 journalists are still imprisoned since the failed 2016 coup. The question now is whether Erdogan will release them. In any case, the media bias was clear throughout the election campaign and on election night, when opposition politicians found themselves squeezed off the air as the results came through.

The economy is still in risky territory

The Turkish lira surged by as much as 3% on Monday and the country's benchmark stock index advanced. The rally could be brief, however.

Turkey's currency, the lira, has fallen dramatically since an attempted coup in July 2016. The central bank has jacked up interest rates to nearly 18% in a bid to stem the tide, but that's piling on the pain for Turkish citizens.

Erdogan, who said he wanted greater control over the economy, has made matters worse by suggesting he wants to control interest rates. Foreign investors, who fear a loss of independence at the central bank, have taken flight.

Turkey's Syria offensive will continue

Erdogan said Turkey would continue to ""liberate Syrian lands,"" during his victory speech Sunday, Reuters reported. Since January, Turkey has been conducting a military operation targeting Kurdish groups in northwest Syria to clear the border area of militias it considers to be terrorist organizations.

The offensive has put Turkey at odds with the United States, its NATO ally, which supports some of the Kurdish forces being targeted by Turkey. In March, the US warned that Turkey's operation in northwest Syria was distracting from the fight against ISIS and had allowed the terror group to build its forces back up in some areas.

Questions remain over NATO alliance

Under Erdogan, Turkey has become NATO's most problematic member. In addition to undermining US policy in Syria, the two NATO allies have sparred over a number of issues in recent years, leading to questions about Ankara's role in the military alliance.

Turkey also unsettled NATO allies by purchasing long-range missiles from Russia. The missile system is not interoperable with pre-existing NATO defenses, and the purchase comes at a time when Moscow is flexing its muscles in the Middle East.

While Turkish officials have renewed their commitment to the alliance in recent months, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has characterized the tensions as a ""difficult issue.""

Turkey's path to EU never looked farther away

Turkey, which has a part of its territory in Europe, applied to join the forerunner of the European Union 30 years ago. Pathways to EU accession talks were always difficult with the huge Muslim-majority country, but under Erdogan they have become even less likely amid growing concerns over the human rights situation in Turkey.

This was the first election Erdogan has run in when he didn't criticize the EU, possibly out of fear of rocking the already-fragile economy. However some analysts think he may now want to improve relations, from a position of strength.

Erdogan casts an eye towards the old Ottoman Empire

Turkey's foreign policy has increasingly focused on rebuilding relationships in former Ottoman Empire territories and beyond in the Muslim world. Ankara most often characterizes these relationships as stemming from ""fraternal ties."" The tip of the soft power for Turkey's outreach is the country's development agency, TIKA, which implements projects across the Balkans, Middle East and Africa.

For example, Turkey has set up its largest overseas base in war-ravaged Somalia to train the country's soldiers while its aid agencies implement development projects. This outreach across regions has also been an integral part of the Turkey's search for broader markets.

Rob Weiner was the associate deputy attorney general in the Obama administration and senior counsel in the White House counsel's office in the Clinton administration. He is currently a partner at Arnold & Porter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are theirs.

(CNN) On Wednesday, President Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said that Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team have concluded that they can't indict a sitting president, simply because Justice Department guidelines prohibit such an action.

Whether or not President Trump should be indicted, he can be indicted. Giuliani's statement, which he attributes to Mueller, is not, in fact, etched in constitutional granite.

For starters, the Constitution does not say that a president is immune from indictment or prosecution. By contrast, the Constitution does provide limited immunity from prosecution for members of Congress: except in cases of treason, felony and breach of the peace, they are not subject to arrest when Congress is in session and they may not be ""questioned in any other place"" for anything they say in any speech or debate in the Congress.

So, the Founders who authored our Constitution clearly knew how to provide legal immunity. They thus could easily have done so for Presidents. But they did not.

The Justice Department position in question by which, according to Giuliani, Mueller feels bound is based on opinions by its Office of Legal Counsel -- one written in 1973 and the other in 2000 -- when Presidents Nixon and Clinton were both in the legal crosshairs. While well-considered, nothing about this decades-old policy restricts reconsideration, in whole or part, of the conclusion that a president cannot be subject to an indictment or trial.

Notably, the staffs of Independent Counsels Leon Jaworski in 1974 and Kenneth Starr in 1998 opined that indictments could be brought against a President while still in office. Indeed, the Clinton administration's Justice Department, while concluding that ""considerations of constitutional structure"" suggest not indicting a sitting president, acknowledged that the Constitution does not squarely answer the question.

What, then, are these structural barriers to indictment? The first is the idea that our separation of powers would be offended if one branch were able to take actions that might imperil the ability of another branch to carry out its constitutionally prescribed duties. That would arguably be the case, for example, if an official in the judicial branch (a judge, to be exact) could toss the head of the executive branch (the president) in a cell at a time when he is due to meet in Singapore with another head of state to negotiate possible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Such a meeting generally would be a legitimate exercise of executive authority, not an abuse of power that a court should be able to block.

But, an indictment of the president does not really raise a separation of powers concern because the powers in play here are not truly separate. While a grand jury is an arm of the judiciary, the Department of Justice and the attorneys within it, who control the actions of the grand jury, fall under the executive branch, the same branch as the President. The Justice Department's inhibitions against indicting a sitting president are very powerful, but extreme situations would surely be enough to overcome them.

In any event, if an indictment were to occur, it would not inevitably, or even probably, prevent the President from exercising his legitimate duties. The interference would come from a trial and the imposition of punishment.

Nothing about an indictment alone determines the timing and pace of a trial or the conditions of a sentence. Indeed, a president would have a compelling basis, perhaps a constitutionally unassailable right, to delay any trial until his term expires.

Why though would one indict, but not immediately try, a president? Among other things, it might be important to indict in order to prevent a statute of limitations from running out and rendering a presidential crime unpunishable if trial is delayed to accommodate a president's duties.

Some may think that an indictment would be a cloud over the administration, and thus be contrary to the national interest. If this were so, an indictment could be sealed and kept secret until the president's term concluded. Or the more likely scenarios would be either a presidential resignation or resorting to the 25th Amendment , which could enable the vice president to stand in for the president if an actual or impending trial prevented him from performing his duties. The Supreme Court undermined the ""interference"" argument in Clinton v. Jones. In that case, Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, sued President Clinton alleging that he made sexual advances when he was governor and retaliated against her when she complained.

The Supreme Court held forcefully that the president is subject to the same laws that apply to all other citizens; that there is no immunity for unofficial conduct; and that the separation of powers doctrine does not require delaying private actions until after the president leaves office.

The Paula Jones case stands for the proposition that the federal courts will not allow the president's official duties to shield him against private litigants who legitimately seek to advance a claim. The interest protected by the Supreme Court was Paula Jones' right -- as a single citizen and a plaintiff -- to sue a sitting president in a civil case.

When we enforce our criminal laws, the protected interest is not just that of a single plaintiff: it is, in the truest sense, the public's interest because, in the hierarchy of administering justice, the enforcement of our criminal laws protects us all. That collective interest in the administration of criminal justice is precisely why we say no one is above the law. Even presidents.

The Office of Legal Counsel opinions argue, however, that an indictment would itself be far more debilitating than a civil suit, distracting the president and eclipsing his moral authority.

But that is not an entrenched rule of law. It is a judgment based on context. In any event, it is not clear why an indictment would be more debilitating and distracting than a pledge by the prosecutor to indict the president as soon as his term ends, or a report by the special counsel accusing the president of committing felonies. On the contrary, an indictment provides a president the opportunity for vindication by a favorable jury verdict.

While the Office of Legal Counsel is authorized to render legal advice, it is not so clear that the office establishes the policies of the Department of Justice. More importantly, the point of a special counsel is to be independent of the political offices of the Department of Justice. Notwithstanding its long tradition of professionalism, the Office of Legal Counsel is run by political appointees.

The other structural problem that some find with the idea of indicting a sitting president is the Constitution's procedure for dealing with presidential crimes: impeachment.

But impeachment is a process simply to remove an official from office and protect that office and the Republic as a whole.

Criminal processes, by contrast, exist to deter and to punish individuals for their wrongdoing. Impeachment from office is simply not a substitute for punishment, and that is why the Constitution specifies that an official removed from office as the result of impeachment, ""shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.""

Again, our point here is not what the special counsel should do with regard to his investigation, but what he can do. So, contrary to what Mr. Giuliani may think, a special counsel can indict a president, as long as -- and only as long as -- the evidence and circumstances so dictate.",Presidents can be indicted,http://cnn.com/2018/05/22/opinions/presidents-can-be-indicted-opinion-quinn-weiner/index.html
146,146,2018-02-07 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Do you have pounds to lose but don't have a weight loss plan? If you are seriously considering how to go about shedding pounds, there are three proven levels of intervention, depending on your individual needs.

If you are severely overweight and have not been able to lose an adequate amount of weight with lifestyle changes or weight loss medications, or if you have serious health issues related to obesity, bariatric (or weight loss) surgery is a potential option.

""You consider surgery when other therapies for obesity fail,"" said Sue Cummings, a registered dietitian who was clinical programs coordinator at the Massachusetts General Hospital Weight Center for the past 20 years. ""The person has been through everything -- and now they have diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, arthritis. ... That's when you would really start to think about surgery.""

Bariatric surgery procedures

Weight loss surgeries performed in the US include gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy (also known as gastric sleeve) and a procedure called biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. The latter has the best outcomes in terms of weight loss and remission of many medical conditions associated with obesity, according to Cummings. However, it also carries the most risks.

The adjustable gastric band is another option, though long-term risks associated with the band have led to a significant decrease in surgeons performing the procedure, Cummings said.

The criteria for bariatric surgery include a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher (or more than 100 pounds overweight) or a BMI of 35 or higher with health problems including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease or sleep apnea. (A BMI of 30 or more with a serious health problem is indicated only for the gastric band ).

The surgeries result in weight loss for two reasons: They reduce the amount of food one can eat, and they cause changes in hormones produced in the intestines that help reduce hunger, increase fullness and regulate blood sugar. For a detailed description of how the different weight loss surgeries work, check the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery's online guide

In essence, the reason most bariatric surgeries are so effective in producing long-term weight loss is that they strongly affect the physiological regulation of body weight, interfering with signals that defend against starvation and weight loss, Cummings explained. This ultimately changes a person's set point, or the level at which weight tends to stabilize.

GET HELP Call the National Eating Disorders Association helpline: 1-800-931-2237

""Surgery literally changes how your body regulates body weight,"" she said.

For example, the fundus, or upper part of the stomach, is the main site where ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates appetite, is produced. After the removal of the fundus in the gastric sleeve, the production of ghrelin is significantly reduced . In the gastric bypass and to a lesser extent the sleeve, there is an accelerated delivery of nutrients into the portion of the small intestine known as the hindgut, which causes an increase in secretion of hormones that inhibit appetite and induce satiety, according to Cummings.

Benefits and risks

An individual's response to weight loss surgery varies, although on average, people who have bariatric surgery lose 15% to 35% of their starting weight. Gastric bypass tends to result in more weight loss than the band or gastric sleeve, Cummings said, though ""every bariatric procedure studied demonstrates similar wide variations in outcomes among patients.""

As a consequence of weight loss, bariatric surgery can improve many health conditions related to obesity, including type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, acid reflux and joint pain. In gastric bypass, improvement in diabetes occurs within days of surgery and is independent of weight loss. The reason is due to hormonal changes, which enhance insulin's response to nutrients, Cummings explained.

The benefits of weight loss surgery do not come without risks and long-term considerations, however. ""About 10% to 20% of patients fail to lose a significant amount of weight, and others experience significant or premature weight regain,"" Cummings said.

Complications of surgery may include infection, bleeding, poor absorption of nutrients or dehydration early on, as well as ulcers and hernias. A side effect of gastric bypass known as ""dumping syndrome"" can occur shortly after eating and may result in nausea, dizziness, weakness, cold sweats, cramps and diarrhea.

Long-term outcomes vary, as well. According to one 12-year study of people who had gastric band surgery, one in three experienced band erosion , and nearly half of patients needed to have their bands removed.

It's important to recognize that lifestyle changes after surgery are extremely important. That includes avoiding many food temptations that surround you, such as fast food french fries and the scones at the local coffee shop.

""Surgery is not going to change the environment; therefore, combining lifestyle changes with surgery will produce the best outcomes,"" Cummings said. Those changes include eating more whole foods, avoiding refined and processed foods, and increasing physical activity each day.

Additionally, lifelong supplementation of vitamins and minerals -- including iron, calcium, folate, vitamins B12 and B1 and vitamin D -- is required. ""The risk of deficiencies increase as a patient progresses from surgery, so all patients need to have their nutritional labs monitored yearly for life,"" Cummings said.

The decision to have weight loss surgery is not an easy one. Every patient needs to be fully informed of the risks and the benefits, and should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team including a surgeon, a doctor (their primary care physician and/or an obesity medicine specialist), a registered dietitian and a mental health professional, Cummings explained.

If so, surgery is the most effective therapy,"" Cummings said, adding that ""data show an increased life expectancy due to the remission and/or resolution of over 190 medical conditions associated with obesity, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, sleep apnea, high blood pressure, kidney failure and more.""",Weight loss interventions that work: Surgery,http://cnn.com/2018/02/07/health/weight-loss-surgery-drayer/index.html

(CNN) The US Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, is going through one of the roughest patches in her public career. She still appears on the front pages with pronouncements at the UN, but her star, which was burning so brightly in the first year of the Trump administration, is beginning to dim significantly in the second year.

Here are some of the things which have put a dent in her stature. Haley did not attend the summit in Singapore between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. Though it's unclear whether she was included in preparations or even invited, her absence was quite noticeable. Haley had been one of Trump's first choices for a top-level foreign policy position, had been granted Cabinet-level rank by Trump as his UN envoy and tasked by him to push his ""America First"" policies at the UN. And, in fact, she led the fight in the UN Security Council to successfully impose stricter sanctions on North Korea, citing it as one of her accomplishments. Yet, in this, Trump's most important foreign policy foray of his presidency, she may have been left out.

Stephen Schlesinger

She also missed out on another symbolic moment in the Trump saga -- she did not attend the ceremonial opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem. She had championed Trump's decision to move the embassy against fierce opposition both in the UN Security Council, where her veto of a resolution condemning the event was a lone vote blocking it (14-1), and in the General Assembly, where only eight other countries backed her attempt to refute a similar critical declaration. Some 128 nations voted for it and another 56 nations did not vote or abstained. Afterward, Haley went to great trouble to hold a reception for those few countries that had supported Washington to emphasize America's anger over its treatment at the UN.

Most recently, upheavals in Washington have now left her as the odd woman out in Trump's foreign policy's team. This has been a remarkable turn-about for, in Trump's first year, Haley outshone Trump's Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of Defense James Mattis -- all grey men with little visibility -- with her vivacity, her skill in the media and winning television personality. Indeed, she even appeared, at times, to be pursuing her own foreign policy at the UN due to the continuing distractions and personnel reductions at the State Department and Trump's focus on domestic matters. Time Magazine put her on the cover as one of the most important ""women who are changing the world.""

But over the last several months, the President has replaced two of his three top national security figures -- John Bolton as the new National Security Adviser and Michael Pompeo as the new Secretary of State. These two men are hard-headed bureaucratic in-fighters -- Pompeo a former CIA director and congressman of deeply conservative convictions and Bolton a far-right ideologue. Both are also savvy operators in the media and are based in Washington DC, making them closer to Trump than Haley is. Trump, indeed, has said he likes Pompeo's manner and, while Bolton has no intimate ties to the President, he is just down the hall from Trump in the White House. Neither man is likely to give Haley any further free rein at the United Nations.

(CNN) Ethiopia is undergoing remarkable political transformation never seen in the country's recent history.

Since coming to power just over two months ago, the new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, has taken a series of radical steps that are transforming the political map and restoring trust in public authority.

On Tuesday (June 5), the government made three major and politically consequential announcements: it lifted the state of emergency imposed shortly after former Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned, announced plans to liberalize the economy and declared it was ready to fully comply with and implement the Algiers Agreement that ended Africa's most deadly conflict.

Reforms at home

Perhaps the most popular Ethiopian leader to date, the Prime Minister's performance over the last two months has been stellar.

Awol K. Allo

Since his inauguration , the Prime Minister has toured the country, listening to the people's grievances. He has reassured the public that his government is ready to take concrete steps towards democratic opening and national reconciliation.

His government has released thousands of political prisoners, met with the political opposition and civil society to discuss reform, invited previously exiled political parties to return to their country, and embarked on major institutional reforms, including the security and the justice sectors.

In just 66 days, the Prime Minister has turned a new page in Ethiopian history, restoring hope and optimism in the direction the country is taking.

The concrete and symbolic steps being taken on both national and regional levels show that the Ethiopian leadership is making impressive strides towards the party's promise to widen the democratic public space and foster national reconciliation.

A deadly war

In 1998, Ethiopia and Eritrea fought one of Africa's senseless and deadliest war, which killed an estimated 100,000 people , ripping the social fabric that tied these culturally and economically interconnected peoples together.

In 2000, the two countries signed the Algiers Peace Agreement , which was designed not just to end the military hostilities and the killings but also to repair the socio-economic fabric ruptured by the war.

Yet, 16 years on, the countries are still at a 'no peace, no war' situation, with thousands of soldiers still manning the border regions.

Although both countries presented territorial disputes as an official justification for the war, the real reason behind the war is far more complex and has uniquely regional historical and cultural roots.

Ethiopia invoked technical and bureaucratic justifications to derail the implementation of the boundary commission's decision and ultimately frustrated the process, setting the scene for the intractable stalemate.

The Eritrean government used Ethiopia's refusal to relinquish sovereign Eritrean territory and the subsequent militarization of the border to justify its own repressive rules at home.

The regime maintained compulsory military service, and pursued politically and economically that forced an estimated 3% of its people to flee the country.

Over the last 16 years, the Eritrean government demanded Ethiopia's full compliance with the Boundary Commission's decision as a condition for normalizing relations.

Now that Ethiopia has satisfied Eritrea's demands, putting the ball firmly within Eritrea's court, the Eritrean regime cannot use these excuses to prolong the conflict and maintain the persistent repressions at home.

Given the transformational changes taking shape in Ethiopia and the concrete steps the new leadership have taken in the domestic arena, there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of the government.

After all, this announcement is a continuation of the promise Prime Minister Ahmed made during his inaugural speech two months ago.

Ethiopia's announcement to comply fully with the Boundary Commission's decision will mark a new chapter in the relations between the two countries and will be consequential for regional peace and stability.

Fastest growing economy

Another major announcement by the new government center around plans to liberalize the economy, including decisions to privatize fully or partially lucrative state enterprises such as aviation, energy, telecommunication, and manufacturing.

Under the plan, foreign and domestic investors can buy minority stakes in sectors that were previously deemed off limits to private enterprise.

This announcement represents a major policy shift by the government as the new leadership seeks a new direction for the economy while maintaining the interventionist aspects of the developmental state policy.

Since the 2005 disputed National Election, the ruling party and its leadership embraced the 'Democratic developmental state' economic model and used this phrase to describe the ruling party's ideology and to criticize the neo-liberal economic model.

Over the last decade, Ethiopia registered impressive economic performance. Although there are reasons to suspect the credibility of the data and the real extent of the growth, it was among the fastest growing economies in the world, averaging double-digit economic growth and cutting poverty by half.

However, the developmental state model as practiced by the previous government is not merely an economic policy.

It is a politico-economic whole underpinned by a project of social engineering and political control, leading to massive land grab and the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of people from their ancestral lands without appropriate consultation or compensation.

While the policy shift does not constitute a wholesale abnegation of the developmental state model, it certainly represents a significant departure from the previous approach.

According to the press statement, the government will continue to participate in economic activities to ensure increased spending on infrastructure investments and other socially rewarding projects.

However, as the government seeks to widen the political space and empower citizens, the authoritarian economic model practiced by the previous governments needs to undergo a renewal.

Many of Ethiopia's public enterprises have been neither efficient nor profitable and their privatization is long overdue. Several sectors under public ownership such as telecommunication and electricity can benefit from private sector investment and dynamism.

Serious risks

While Ethiopia's economy certainly needed a new direction, the government must be cautious and must move with extreme care in rolling out these policies, particularly in opening up certain sectors to foreign investment.

For example, it is not clear why the government seeks to partly privatize the Ethiopian Airlines, the most efficient, profitable, and reliable African airline.

The carrier, which has dominated the African sky by acquiring several under performing airlines, is considered a national treasure, which has a significance far greater than revenue generation.

The government must undertake a thorough impact assessment sector by sector, and industry by industry, if necessary, to minimize the devastating effects of opening up capital strapped markets to foreign competition.

Finally, Ethiopia's new leadership is making remarkable progress on several fronts, but faces serious risks from within which could jeopardize the progress made over the last two months.

It is important that regional powers and Western governments support the transition in this country whose stability is critical for the entire Horn of Africa region.","Ethiopia's new Prime Minister has had a stellar two months, can he keep it up?",http://cnn.com/2018/06/07/africa/ethiopia-abiy-ahmed-transformation-intl/index.html
149,149,2018-06-24 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has emerged victorious in a high-stakes election, seeing off the most serious challenge yet to his political dominance and tightening his grip on the nation he has ruled for 15 years.

Defeating the twin threats of a reinvigorated opposition and a weakened currency, Erdogan declared himself the winner even before official results were confirmed.

With 97.7% of the votes counted, Sadi Guven, chief of Turkey's Supreme Election Board, said Erdogan had won an absolute majority, avoiding a runoff against his principal challenger, Muharrem Ince. State media put Erdogan on 52.5%, well ahead of Ince on 31%.

""The winners of the June 24 elections are Turkey, the Turkish nation, sufferers of our region and all oppressed (people) in the world,"" Erdogan said in a victory address from a balcony at the AKP's offices in the capital Ankara in the early hours of Monday morning.

The results were a blow to Ince and his Republican People's Party, known as the CHP, who ran a spirited campaign that threatened to force Erdogan into a damaging runoff and deny his party control of parliament.

Conceding defeat, Ince warned that constitutional changes ushered in by Erdogan earlier in the year represented a threat to the country's democracy.

""A single person is becoming the head of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary and this is a concern for a threat to the survival of the country,"" he told journalists. ""Turkey has departed from democratic values and Turkey has broken its ties with the parliamentary system which it had.""

""We're now in a one-man rule -- there's no mechanism to prevent arbitrary rule. We continue to have great concerns about this situation.""

Expanded powers

Erdogan starts a new five-year term as president with sweeping new powers granted in a narrowly won referendum last year, denounced by his critics as a blatant power grab. Under the new system, the office of prime minister is abolished, parliament's powers curtailed and the president is accorded wide-ranging executive authority.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Monday that the implementation of the constitutional amendments ""is important for our stability and economic development.""

""It's a new system for us,"" he said, adding that it was approved by the Turkish electorate.

In any case, Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) and its allied Nationalist Movement Party's (MHP) retained their parliamentary majority.

""Turkey has decided to take the side of growth, development, investment, enrichment and a reputable, honorable and influential country in all areas in the world,"" Erdogan told cheering supporters.

Erdogan had earlier claimed victory in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city. ""I would like to congratulate our nation once again. This has been another test of democracy and we have passed this test successfully,"" he said.

Supporters of Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, leader, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan celebrate outside the party headquarters.

Russia congratulated Erdogan on his re-election, with a government statement saying President Vladimir Putin ""stressed that the outcome of the vote fully confirms Erdogan's great political authority, broad support of the course pursued under his leadership towards solving vital social and economic tasks facing Turkey, and enhancing the country's foreign policy positions.""

Cheering supporters

After a day in which millions cast their votes, throngs of Erodogan supporters waited until the early hours of Monday morning to hear Erdogan speak. In the largest city, Istanbul, cars in the street and boats on the Bosporus honked their horns and fireworks lit up the sky.

Erdogan supporter Emine Kilic said that she was happy with the result, despite what she sees as virulent opposition to the ruling party.

""I think the election outcome is very very good but it could have been much better,"" she said from Istanbul. ""That's because of the evil forces and many traitors inside the country. But still it's good we won!""

Others decried the result, fearing that the political climate was becoming more intolerant.

""I am very, very upset,"" Burcu, an Istanbul resident, said. ""Really, really... as a young woman... I am only 25. I want to live in this country but as a young woman... it is becoming harder to live in this country, women are not respected and the education system is upside down.""

Around 59 million people were eligible to vote in both presidential and parliamentary elections Sunday . Erdogan said the participation rate was 90%, an extraordinarily high number for any election.

Cavusoglu, the foreign minister, lauded the turnout. ""Turkish society is very engaged with democracy. If you look at the turnout rates its almost 90%. Under the leadership of our president, the ruling party will be working further to strengthen democracy.""

Earlier, state news agency Anadolu reported that the President had sailed through the snap vote at 52.7%, with more than 96% of the ballots counted. It also said the AKP-MHP coalition had more than 53% of the parliamentary vote, with over 98% of the votes counted.

But the opposition CHP had said that around half the ballot boxes had not yet been counted, and called on party monitors to stay by the ballot boxes and keep watching.

People shout slogans and let off flares after counting of votes in Turkey's presidential and parliamentary elections commenced.

A spokesman for Erodgan's AKP, Mahir Unal, dismissed the accusations and warned party leaders of ""harsh outcomes"" to any provocations.

Opposition parties will have five days after the vote to lodge any complaints or challenges.

Erdogan has dominated Turkish politics since his rise as prime minister in 2003 and has transformed the nation. He implemented policies that encouraged sustained economic growth and development, he challenged Turkey's secular foundations by bringing Islamic conservatism to public life and he gutted public institutions by having tens of thousands of people -- many of them his critics -- arrested after a failed military coup in 2016.

Erdogan himself called the snap elections 18 months early, as he faces battles on several fronts: Turkish voters are feeling the pain of soaring inflation, a plunging currency and high interest rates as the economy falters, and the normally splintered opposition is largely united against him for the first time in years.

By offering a wider than usual range of presidential candidates, the opposition had hoped to split the vote enough ways to leave the front-runner with less than 50% of the ballots.

In the late 1990s, Sweeney made headlines because of his research on ""Schwarzenegger mice,"" which were up to 30% stronger than their average counterparts. Sweeney had been able to isolate the gene responsible for activating a protein -- IGF-1 -- that controls muscle growth and repair.

The main focus of his experiments was on how to limit the deterioration of muscles with age, but the results also appealed to athletes in search of a performance boost.

Word got out, however, that he was not interested.

Ahead of this year's Commonwealth Games, which started April 4, Sweeney's was not such a hot number for athletes in search of an unfair advantage -- possibly because he is now an adviser for the World Anti-Doping Agency.

""At the beginning, when we first started publishing on this, we did get contacted by high-level athletes,"" said Sweeney, who's also director of the University of Florida's Myology Institute. ""These days, it's mostly body builders and people desperate to increase their performance or abilities.""

Back then, gene therapy -- defined as the technique of using and manipulating genes in order to treat or prevent diseases -- wasn't as established as it is today and wasn't recognised as enough of a threat to be listed as a banned practice in sport. But it soon became known that gene therapies could one day be used for much more than disease.

Responding promptly to the possibility, in 2002, the anti-doping agency established ""gene and cell-doping panels"" of expert scientists to discuss how best to head off the problem.

In 2003, the organization banned ""gene doping,"" which it defined as the ""nontherapeutic use of cells, genes, genetic elements, or modulation of gene expression, having the capacity to enhance performance.""

This new frontier of doping presented a simple and dark idea: What if there was a way for dopers to never be caught?

Now, almost 20 years later, the technology is has finally been used to treat patients with rare diseases -- such as severe combined immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous disorder, hemophilia, blindness, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases -- by transferring missing genes into skeletal muscles, Sweeney said. ""So because of that, it is now at a point where potentially it could be used by athletes.

""It could be done today in athletes if some company and government would put the resources (in) to make it happen,"" he said.

Getting inside your genes

In the case of the ""Schwarzenegger mice,"" Sweeney used the classic method of gene therapy, in which he modified the animals' DNA using a virus to deliver and insert the required gene that would make the mice stronger.

Genes are delivered into an organism using a ""vector,"" the most common being viruses, like that used by Sweeney, which have been modified to be safe and no longer cause disease. The vectors carry the desired gene into targeted cells and, there, unload the genetic material, which in turn instructs the organism to produce the protein the gene encodes.

One example of a protein well-known to athletes is erythropoietin, commonly known as EPO, which regulates the production of red blood cells in the body, increasing hemoglobin and oxygen delivery to tissues.

With the injection of external EPO, elite athletes -- often cyclists -- have been enhancing performance for years, but authorities have caught on. Anti-doping controls can now detect external EPO efficiently through blood and urine tests.

A doping urine test kit is seen on February 25, 2015 in Chatenay, France.

If extra EPO is being produced organically by a cell's machinery, however, it is almost impossible to detect as a banned substance.

But the technology is not quite at that level yet.

""Making the viruses that are involved in doing the gene transfer is still difficult,"" Sweeney said, highlighting that the science is still complicated and not something athletes could readily do at home.

Another way to dope an athlete's genes is through CRISPR, or CRISPR-Cas9, a technique that allows geneticists to edit specific parts of a person's genome by removing or altering sections of DNA -- also known as gene editing.

The technique is rapidly developing, leading to a World Anti-Doping Agency announcement in October that it was expanding its ""gene-doping"" ban to ""gene editing agents designed to alter genome sequences and/or the transcriptional or epigenetic regulation of gene expression.""

The ban went into effect in January.

""There's a couple of ways you can use CRISPR-Cas9,"" Sweeney said. ""One is to take cells from a person, modify those cells and put them back into the person, and that is probably the safest way to use it.

""The other way to use it, which is to modify your existent DNA in the body, is potentially very unsafe.""

False kit of genetics editing with Crispr Cas-9 technology.

Sweeney pointed out that scientists do not know what unintended consequences could come from changing a specific gene in an individual, meaning the technology is not even ready for trials in patients with lethal diseases.

In the case of gene-doping through gene therapies, using vectors for delivery, it's relatively easy to look for an extra copy of a gene and confirm that an athlete has been doped when you have access to a biological sample, such as blood, said Olivier Rabin, senior executive director of sciences and international partnerships at the anti-doping agency.

In particular, Rabin said, the agency looks at white-blood cells and has developed a methodology that can be applied to search for different genes. Further detail was not provided, as it is kept confidential in order to catch athletes, he added.

""Gene editing is a little more complex than gene therapy,"" Rabin added. The anti-doping agency is working on strategies to reveal the possibility of people editing their genes for performance enhancement, he said.

Rabin highlighted that most of the agency's efforts focus on white blood cells as ""pretty good markers of gene manipulation"" because some evidence of manipulation will usually end up in the blood.

Asked what it is doing to monitor and test athletes for gene doping, the International Olympic Committee did not comment directly but said, ""We have nothing to add to the section on gene doping in WADA's prohibited list.""

The question now is whether the first few cases have, in fact, happened without our knowledge.

Modern occurrence

""I never heard anything about it except for one time, and it was around five years ago,"" said Sebastian Weber, coach of four-time Union Cycliste Internationale world champion (time trialling) Tony Martin. ""There was some buzz around a substance called AICAR,"" or 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide.

AICAR is a performance-enhancing drug that the French Anti-Doping Agency suspected was used in the 2009 Tour de France; it stimulates mitochondria, the part in the muscles responsible for aerobic energy production.

In cycling, for gene doping to be effective, techniques should target both EPO levels and red blood cell production to have a higher oxygen delivery to the muscles, Weber says -- but they would also need to increase the mass and number of mitochondria in order to actually produce energy from that oxygen.

""Just because you have more oxygen, it doesn't necessary mean you also have the capacity to produce energy out of it,"" Weber said.

As AICAR was a drug, it wasn't gene doping, but it led people to wonder about what was next, he says, after this ""first step"" toward stimulating the body's mitochondria. ""That was the only time I heard people talking about the possibility of gene-doping.""

Tailoring to your genes

There are other ways genetics -- and a deep knowledge of them -- could help athletes improve their performance, by understanding their physiology.

For example, project GENESIS -- focused on how applied genomics in elite sports can improve performance -- and its offshoot, the RugbyGene Project, are trying to identify which genetic characteristics help athletes succeed.

""We recognize it is not only genetic,"" said Dr. Alun Williams, an exercise geneticist at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK who works on both projects. ""Training, diet and other lifestyle habits are massive factors. But along with that, the evidence is that it's impossible to have success in sports without some genetic [factors] in your favor.""

The researchers of these projects are hoping to identify which genes help -- or hinder -- athletes in their specific disciplines, to develop their skills in a more tailored way. For example, if an athlete has shown to have a higher genetic vulnerability to tendon injuries, scientists and coaches could reduce certain aspects of their training load over the course of the season, give longer rest periods, reduce the number of matches played in a season, or provide specific exercises and pre-habilitation workouts.

But Williams points out that the field is still at an early stage. ""This picture where certain genes (or even two or three genes) are related to a particular characteristic, like the tendon injury, is still a small bit of a bigger picture,"" he said. ""So it's very important that this information that is available is put into context.""

A different point of view

Some experts argue that we're looking at it all wrong and that athletes will always use the most modern technology to seek out an advantage -- illegal or not.

""Modern sports have been principally valued on the basis of record-breaking and being able to witness extraordinary performances,"" said bioethicist Andy Miah, the University of Salford Chair in Science Communication and Future Media and author of ""Genetically Modified Athletes: Biomedical Ethics, Gene Doping and Sport."" ""Even if it's not a world record, it's about trying to see something special in what humans can do, and often, that is about transcending boundaries.""

We give athletes all sort of technology to do that, added Miah, who readily claims to ""disagree with anti-doping.""

Instead of the current scenario, in which anti-doping keeps trying to catch up with doping, Miah suggests a safer form of performance enhancement.

155,155,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) The funeral for Antwon Rose II, the unarmed teen shot by police last week near Pittsburgh, was held Monday, hours after an interview aired in which Antwon's mother accused police of killing her son ""in cold blood.""

East Pittsburgh police Officer Michael Rosfeld shot Antwon, 17, three times as he fled a car stopped by police.

Since his death, protesters have marched in downtown Pittsburgh demanding accountability. Several groups shut down highways and intersections across the city during several days of protest.

""Three shots in the back. How you justify that?"" protesters chanted.

The protests were put on hold Monday to allow the family to mourn. Antwon's friends and family members attended his funeral at Woodland Hills Intermediate School in Swissvale, where Antwon once was enrolled as a student.

JUST WATCHED Four arrested in protest over police shooting Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Four arrested in protest over police shooting 01:42

The funeral program featured three pictures of Antwon smiling over the years, as well as a poem in which he wrote, ""I see mothers bury their sons. I want my mom to never feel that pain.""

An obituary described him as a well-traveled teen who took honors classes and loved to play basketball, surf and skate.

""Antwon was a beautiful, bright, charming and generous person and volunteered his time at and services to the (The Free Store) in Braddock,"" the program says.

Media were not allowed inside, but reporters could clearly see the parking lot was filled to capacity. A motorcade carrying some of Antwon's family members arrived with a police vehicle from Rankin, where Antwon lived, bringing up the rear. Fifteen minutes after the service began, mourners continued to arrive and enter the school.

As mourners -- some of whom have been attending the protests -- left the funeral around 1 p.m., they shouted to the assembled media outside. ""Say his name!"" said one. Another cried, ""Justice for my cousin!"" Some held their fists in the air as they left the school.

'Ready to fight'

""I am in amazement that this all has something to do with my son, but I'm destroyed by the reason why. I appreciate all the protesters, but I just want them to protest peacefully,"" Antwon's mother Michelle Kenney said in an exclusive interview with ABC that aired Monday.

On Sunday, mourners gathered for Antwon's wake.

""Today has been a particularly difficult day because the finality begins to set in, when you see your son laid out, embalmed and lifeless,"" Lee Merritt, the attorney for Antwon's family, said Sunday. ""Tomorrow will be a more difficult day.""

His parents are in shock over the death of their son, but also frustrated by the media reports on his character. They're also upset the officer who shot Antwon hasn't been charged, Merritt said.

""They're ready to fight,"" Merritt said of Antwon's parents. ""In the coming weeks, you're going to hear a lot more from them. They're like the protesters. They're not going anywhere. They have a lot to say.""

Teen's mom: 'He murdered my son'

Antwon was a passenger in the car, which authorities suspected of being involved in a shooting earlier in the day on June 19, Allegheny County police said.

The officer ordered the driver out of the car and onto the ground, police said. Antwon and another passenger ""bolted"" from the vehicle, and the East Pittsburgh officer opened fire, striking the teenager, police said.

Antwon had an empty magazine clip in his pocket, according to Mike Manko, spokesman for the Allegheny County district attorney. Pressed for more information, officials declined to elaborate.

The unidentified 23-year-old who captured video of the shooting appeared in silhouette on ABC to describe what she saw that day.

""It was like he was taking target practice out on this young man's back. He didn't flinch. He didn't say, 'Stop running.' He didn't say anything,"" she said.

Rosfeld had been sworn in to the East Pittsburgh police force just hours before the shooting, though he'd worked with other local departments for seven years, CNN affiliate WPXI reported.

""He murdered my son in cold blood. If he has a son, I pray his heart never has to hurt the way mine does,"" Kenney told ABC , adding that she believes Rosfeld should pay for taking her son's life.

Rosfeld has been placed on administrative leave, police said.

During her ABC interview, Kenney declined to speak about the circumstances that preceded her son's death, but she had a response to those who say Antwon shouldn't have been in the car suspected in the prior shooting.

""My son is dead. For all those people that say that, their son must be at home,"" she said.

157,157,2018-03-30 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) For the past 20 years, Hope Workman has hustled up a dirt path on the side of a mountain in Lovely, Kentucky, just to get drinking water. She doesn't trust what comes out of her tap.

If she's by herself, she'll take her ATV. If one of her daughters is coming along, they take their four-wheel-drive truck. It takes her about seven minutes to grind up the hill before she reaches her destination: a small plastic well tapped into the side of the mountain with a 3½-foot PVC pipe.

The day CNN visited, the temperature was just above freezing, and Hope's hands shivered as she filled jug after jug with crystal-clear drinking water.

""This is what we go through to get water, unfortunately,"" she said.

Workman is not the only person in Martin County, Kentucky, or America for that matter, who struggles to get clean water. Two well-publicized crises include Flint, Michigan's, lead contamination and Puerto Rico's failing water systems in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

As our water infrastructure system ages, experts say, keeping America's water clean becomes increasingly challenging. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the nation's drinking water infrastructure a grade of D.

According to the the society, about 1 million miles of pipes crisscross the country to deliver us clean water, much of it overseen by local municipalities that are challenged with aging hardware. Many of these pipes were laid underground nearly a century ago and are reaching the end of their life spans. As they age, they can crack, and water breaks become more common. In fact, the entire country loses nearly 6 billion gallons of water a day just to leaky pipes.

For many cash-strapped local utilities, it's difficult to find the resources to manage a problem we rarely see.

Faucets run brown

But when the problem does come to the surface, it's hard to ignore. Just ask the residents of Martin County. Customers of the county's water district post videos and pictures on social media of brown cloudy water spouting out of their taps. Sometimes, it comes out looking like blue Gatorade. Sometimes, it smells like diesel fuel.

Locals ask themselves, ""Just what's in the water?""

Until several months ago, customers received notices on the back of their water bills stating that their water had been tested and found to be above federal limits of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids . These contaminants are a reaction between the chlorine used to treat the water for bacteria and organic matter that may be found in the water or the pipes. Exposure to these chemicals could mean an increased risk of cancer.

Eastern Kentucky has some of the highest levels of cancer in the country due to smoking and obesity, but residents here also wonder whether their water is to blame.

'We're just scared of the water'

Martin County resident BarbiAnn Maynard is convinced that her mother's cancer was related to the water.

""We don't really know what to do. We're just scared of the water and have been for years,"" she said.

""You're afraid to wash your hands if you've got a cut,"" Maynard said. Taking a shower is no better. ""I don't feel like I'm getting clean. I might smell a little bit better, but I don't feel any better about it.""

Dr. Don Lafferty, a local physician, feels that he's in a difficult position when patients ask him whether the water is the source of their health issues. ""I can't tell them it's safe or it isn't safe,"" he told CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta.

""We shouldn't have to be asking ... in 2018 whether or not water is causing cancer in our region.""

Where the War on Poverty began

Nestled in the hills of Eastern Kentucky, Martin County has had a long history tied to coal. Between 1918 and 2015, the county produced more than 436 million tons of coal. But as the coal industry died out, Martin County struggled. Nearly 40% of its population lives at or below the federal poverty level. The unemployment rate in the county is almost double the national rate.

But poverty has been endemic to the area for years. President Lyndon Johnson came here in 1964 to launch his War on Poverty.

""In 2018, in the very place where LBJ declared war on poverty ... water is our number one issue. That's hard to imagine,"" said Gary Ball, editor-in-chief of the local weekly newspaper, The Mountain Citizen.

What's happened in Martin County is a worst-case scenario that may be happening in other parts of the country, said Lindell Ormsbee, director of the Kentucky Water Resources Research Institute at the University of Kentucky.

""I think it's somewhat of a systematic representation of what's happening in a lot of other places where no one's looking. It's almost like the proverbial canary in the mine,"" Ormsbee said.

What is happening?

A large part of the issue in Martin County is just hardware itself. There are about 300 miles of piping that deliver water across the county, placed up and over rocky terrain, making them even more susceptible to leaking. Today, more than half of the water that leaves the Martin County Water District treatment center doesn't make it to the faucet.

When water systems are operating optimally, there is enough going through the pipes at a high enough pressure that debris from outside the pipe can't make its way inside. Essentially, there's so much water going through so quickly that even if there is a crack in the pipe, the water can act as a barrier. But as soon as that pressure drops or there's less water going through the pipes, there is suddenly room for soil, debris and chemical residue to sneak into the drinking water.

And because of the leakage issues, the Water District hasn't been able to flush the water lines clean in years, said Joe Burns of the Kentucky Rural Water Association. ""As far as systematic lines, it's been years since it's even been able to be accomplished.""

Burns' group is working with the Martin County Water District to help make improvements as best as they can. They've been able to reduce the levels of byproduct contaminants to under federal limits by simply changing where they add the chlorine.

But on top of issues with the lines, there are upgrades to the water treatment facilities, pumps and meters that still need to be made.

Investments in hardware and software are needed

For a financially struggling municipality, it is hard to find resources outside raising water rates, which is difficult for a community of people who mostly live on a limited income.

Infrastructure isn't just pipes and hardware, Ormsbee said; it also includes financial and technical management.

Small water systems, such as Martin County, that serve less than 10,000 customers supply water to nearly 20% of the country . In addition to infrastructure and financial challenges, many of these systems can have a difficult time attracting the technical expertise to help. In fact, small systems made up 72% of EPA violations in 2015 and 2016.

Some citizens in Martin County feel that they've been forgotten. ""Appalachia has been at the forefront in helping to improve this country for many years. ... We've sent people to die in all of our country's wars. We've populated this country with people in all industries,"" Lafferty said. ""We are Americans, too.""

Ball points to a new government center and a business complex in Inez, the county seat. The cost is nearly $20 million, money that he said could have been spent on upgrading the water system.

Some relief

Recently, Martin County received federal grants amounting to $3.4 million to go toward its water system. Experts believe that overhauling the system would take $13.5 million to $15 million.

President Trump's infrastructure proposal gives some residents hope. The $1.5 trillion plan touted by the White House is supposed to cover all infrastructure upgrades in the nation, but experts believe that it would cost the country $1 trillion just to maintain and meet the demands for drinking water for the next 25 years.

Critics further point out the White House's plan earmarks only $200 billion in federal investment. The remainder is to be made up by the states and the private sector.

161,161,2018-05-21 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) If there's one quality I want my girls to have more than any other, it is confidence.

I've seen how important it is in the workplace and in life: Confident people get what they want. They take risks. They are not afraid of failure.

Growing up as a perfectionist, somewhat fearful of both failure and success, I wish I had the confidence in my teens and early 20s that I have now.

For all these reasons, I was thrilled when one of my daughters, during the first grade, had to name five words to describe herself. Confident was on her list. I thought then and still think now, ""What can I do to make sure she feels that way when she is a teenager?""

Journalist, author and speaker Claire Shipman has some answers. In 2014, she and her co-author, Katty Kay, anchor of BBC World News America, published ""The Confidence Code: The Science and Art of Self-Assurance -- What Women Should Know."" The book resonated deeply with women and quickly became a bestseller.

As Shipman and Kay traveled the country to speak about the book, one of the most common questions they would get was from parents, women and men, who were concerned about their daughters.

"" 'What about my daughter? I see this in my daughter,' "" Shipman said they would say. ""It was just this huge focus on young women and girls. 'What can I be doing with my girls, because I already see she's not this. She's experiencing that.' ""

Shipman, who spent a decade at CNN as a White House and international correspondent in the 1990s, said she and Kay did some research and found that there were plenty of books on the topic for parents but not as many specifically written for girls. So they decided to write one for girls in middle school, although it is applicable for girls up through high school, Shipman says.

They also commissioned an online poll, which backs up what other research has shown.

Between the ages of 8 and 14, girls' confidence drops by 30%, according to the survey of nearly 1,400 8- to 18-year-olds and their parents and guardians . The survey also found that three out of four teen girls worry about failing,

""We were surprised at how quickly, how deep that drop is,"" Shipman said. ""And especially because right until age 8, there's really no difference in confidence levels.""

So how do we stop this troubling trend?

I asked Shipman, a mom of two, for some advice -- advice she said she's using with her 13-year-old daughter, with good results.

1. Help her get outside her comfort zone and take risks.

One of the most important things we can do as parents of daughters, Shipman said, is to help them get ""comfortable being uncomfortable."" Shipman said she and Kay feel that if they do nothing else in this book but get girls to walk away and understand that it's cool to take risks, they will have succeeded.

As for how to do that, a parent can talk to their daughter about how they approach a risk and some of the ways they can support themselves. ""It's kind of counterintuitive, but just telling yourself 'Oh, you shouldn't be afraid of this' or 'there's nothing scary about it' or 'fake it until you make it,' that doesn't actually help. Risks can be scary,"" Shipman said.

So encourage your daughter and tell her, ""Yes, it's normal to feel afraid. This is a little frightening, but tell yourself 'I'm just going to do it afraid. I'm just going to do it anyway,' "" Shipman said.

2. Have her keep a list of risks.

Having your daughter keep a list of the risks she has taken and how she worked through them can be a reminder of what she is capable of, Shipman said. The same holds true for failures: Listing their failures and how they tackled them can be incredibly empowering.

Also, have them keep a list of some stock phrases that they can tell themselves when they are in a bit of a frightening situation, such as ""I've done something like this before. I can do it. I've got it.""

3. Remind her of 'failure fixes.'

Our girls need to know that failure will undoubtedly happen and that it's not something they can avoid. But knowing how to deal with it can help. ""We all need a cheat sheet to failure,"" Shipman and Kay write.

They offer a list of 10 ""failure fixes"" such as ""change the channel."" Encourage your daughter to do anything that helps her get in a better place, whether that is reading a book, watching TV, listening to music or cuddling with a family pet. This will help distract her from what's happened and help her stop thinking about it over and over again.

Another fix is putting it in perspective. Shipman talks about an idea she and Kay heard from a middle school counselor, which she called a ""virtual hot air balloon ride."" Help your daughter envision herself up in the sky with the clouds and looking down at the situation that happened. ""First, that lets her kind of literally put it in perspective, like, 'Wow, look, other things are going on,' and then see it from a different angle and talk about it that way.""

Trying to keep a sense of humor is also key. Of course, this is not easy when your daughter is melting down after what she considers the biggest failure of her life. But try to help her see that it could be much worse. ""Thoughts like 'at least I didn't forget to put on pants and go to school naked after our roof caved in' ... can remind you that it really could be worse!"" they write.

4. Role model failure and struggle.

One of the more surprising results (at least to me) from the poll Shipman and Kay commissioned is that fathers seem to be better at recognizing a lack of confidence in their daughters than mothers: They were found to be 26% more likely to accurately estimate their child's confidence than moms were.

How could that be? Aren't mothers supposed to be the more intuitive parents? But as Shipman did her research, she found that mothers perhaps don't see their daughters' behavior as unusual.

""Perfectionism or worry about this or that, or sort of reticence to raise your hand, that's recognizable to us,"" Shipman said. ""Even if instinctively we know it's wrong, it doesn't seem odd, because we've probably experienced it. We may still do it, whereas I think fathers, who do have incredibly high expectations for their daughters, would be (saying) 'What is going on with my 9-year-old? Why was she this way a year ago, and now she's thinking she can't do anything?' They find it genuinely strange.""

The takeaway is how influential role modeling can be for our kids. Let them see us, especially mothers, dealing with failure and struggle and taking risks.

""If we're going on, 'I'm so worried about this. I have to get it right,' it doesn't help them,"" Shipman said. She's tried to take this advice even more with her teenage daughter and ""lift the veil a little bit.""

When she's upset about something, for instance, such as having to rewrite a few chapters for a book, she lets her daughter see how she's feeling and then raises the question whether she's overreacting and figures out how she's going to deal with it -- all in front of her daughter.

5. Remind her she doesn't have a problem.

With all the talk about girls and confidence, it's important to make it clear to our girls that it's not like they have a problem that needs to be fixed, Shipman said. Girls are the way they are for a host of reasons, including nature (brain biology) and nurture (society's different expectations for girls and boys.) They also often have a higher level of emotional intelligence.

""It's not like we want to churn out a bunch of girls who operate like boys,"" Shipman said. ""I think it would be wonderful for young women to understand much earlier on, essentially, the world doesn't operate like school.""

Helping girls understand at young ages what skills will be important later in life is key, including the ability to advocate for themselves and not worry about being people pleasers, Shipman said.

""Girls, even when they speak up in class or whatever it is, they want to please people, so I feel like the next hurdle is for girls to understand that they will not always please people. People won't always like them,"" Shipman said. ""And when they speak up, some people will like what they say, and others won't, and how do they develop that armor so that they say 'but that's OK, because I'm me.'

On Monday, the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) published aerial photographs that the group says show the facility in the Baltic outpost has been under major renovation since 2016.

FAS said the images document refurbishments at the site back in 2016, when one of three underground bunkers at the location was excavated and deepened before it appeared to have been covered over in recent months, ""presumably to return (to) operational status soon.""

Ortega's government later revoked the controversial pension reform a few days after protests broke out, but the unrest continues throughout the Central American nation.

The Nicaraguan government has put the death toll at 34, but the Center for Human Rights says at least 170 people have been killed as of Friday.

(CNN) When Ivanka Trump took the stage at the Republican National Convention in 2016 to stump for her father, then-candidate Donald Trump, she presented herself as the champion of women's rights in her father's future presidency.

In front of millions of Americans, she stood up for working women and mothers, arguing for equal wages, better child care and paid family leave. To many commentators, her speech sounded more suited for the Democratic National Convention than the RNC.

Nonetheless, after Trump became President, Ivanka accepted an official role as an adviser to her father. Her portfolio, unsurprisingly, included women's empowerment and rights.

And yet, despite her claims of championing women's causes, Ivanka has largely failed to make progress on any of the issues she said she would spearhead.

The left-leaning Center for American Progress (CAP) even said that Ivanka's ""sporadic forays into discussions about her issue priorities, more often than not, have been largely rhetorical with few details and little concrete analysis of the economic, racial, gender, ethnic, geographic, and other differences that can influence policy needs and outcomes.""

Ivanka's pattern of inaction has become most evident in recent days, as she remains alarmingly silent on the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy, which has resulted in the forcible separation of parents and children at the border.

Her silence is even more stark in comparison to first lady Melania Trump and former first lady Laura Bush, who have both used their respective platforms to advocate for a solution to this deeply horrifying situation. While Melania's spokesperson Stephanie Grisham said she ""believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart,"" Laura Bush wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that the United States government cannot be in the business of ""warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert outside of El Paso.""

And yet even her stepmother and a former first lady have not been able to persuade Ivanka to speak out.

In fact, she appears to be pouring salt onto the gaping immigration policy wound, posting photos of her beautiful, intact family to her Instagram account.

But why is Ivanka doing this? It's one thing not to make a comment despite being one of her father's closest advisors, but it's quite another to continuously make these truly insensitive posts.

I honestly do not understand what the reason behind her silence is, nor do I understand why she would want to remain silent. As a mother and as a human being, I want to shout at the very top of my lungs every time I think about those children being taken away from their parents.

169,169,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Last October, two House Republican committee chairmen announced their plans to get to the bottom of the FBI's decision-making in 2016 -- namely its handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

""Decisions made by the Department of Justice in 2016 have led to a host of outstanding questions that must be answered,"" Reps. Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said at the time.

But eight months later, the joint investigation has yet to answer many of those questions -- and prompted a growing amount of grumbling from Republicans themselves.

Several Republicans who serve on the two panels told CNN they are dissatisfied with the pace of the investigation, saying the chairmen have been slow to schedule witness interviews and have held marathon sessions with just four witnesses who have shed little light on both the Clinton investigation and the start of the FBI's Russia probe in 2016. They gripe that the chairmen have not pushed the Justice Department harder on their subpoenas to get access to more documents. And some want to have their witness hearings in public settings, rather than behind closed doors as they have been so far.

""The major frustration is with a lack of tenacious spirit in getting documents and scheduling interviews with appropriate witnesses,"" Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, a member of the House Oversight Committee and chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told CNN on Monday. ""While the time frame may be viewed as appropriate, conservative members and the American people feel like much more could be done.""

""No,"" Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, said when asked if he was satisfied by the investigation. ""Because we haven't been tough about getting the documents. We keep playing this game, and it's starting to look like it's a low-energy investigation if we don't start holding people in contempt and beginning impeachment proceedings in the absence of compliance with congressional oversight.""

The comments underscore the headwinds Republicans have faced in trying to unearth new dirt about the Clinton email investigation, which has already been thoroughly reviewed by the Justice Department's inspector general. GOP lawmakers complain they are looking at a smaller amount of records and interviewing fewer witnesses than the inspector general did, and some say the committees have not spent enough energy trying to uncover what they view as malfeasance in the FBI's Russia probe in 2016.

Amid the criticism, the House Judiciary Committee is stepping up its pace. On Tuesday, the panel is slated to vote on a resolution by conservative lawmakers directing the Justice Department to provide documents about surveillance on Trump associates in the 2016 elections, although the committee had to mark up the resolution or it would go straight to the House floor for a vote.

On Wednesday, the FBI agent at the center of controversy in both inquiries -- Peter Strzok -- will meet with the House Judiciary Committee behind closed doors for a deposition after being slapped with a subpoena by Goodlatte, even though Strzok had voluntarily agreed to be interviewed.

And on Thursday, the panel will hold a public hearing with FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein about the inspector general's report, giving the Republicans an opportunity to dress down the FBI and Justice Department leaders about their document requests.

The Republican chairmen say they understand the frustration from their GOP colleagues — and hoped things would have moved faster to this point — but they point the finger at the Justice Department. And Goodlatte told CNN on Monday they have succeeded in forcing the Justice Department to create a process for turning over hundreds of thousands of documents.

""I'm not satisfied,"" the Virginia Republican told CNN. ""But we have made a lot of progress with the establishment of this office at the Department of Justice where we have access to close to a million documents now. We can see them all unredacted, we can identify the ones we want produced. ... I won't say it's complete compliance, but we are getting a lot of information we need.""

Several Republicans on the committees have privately said that Strzok should be grilled in public, so his testimony can't be spun by either side. Goodlatte added that Strzok will face a public hearing at a later date

""They'll get that opportunity, but we're going to interview him first,"" he said. ""Sometime soon we'll have a public hearing — that's the intention.""

But President Donald Trump joined his conservative allies to protest the closed-door hearing on Twitter Monday evening.

""The hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI & DOJ should be shown to the public on live television, not a closed door hearing that nobody will see,"" Trump tweeted. ""We should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency!""

Lawmakers say they're at a loss over why more witnesses haven't come through -- including former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who traded thousands of text messages with Strzok in 2016, including some decidedly anti-Trump messages. Trump and his conservative allies have seized on their texts as a key reason to make the case that the Clinton and Russia probes have been tainted.

""We've wanted to interview and depose Lisa Page months ago,"" Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a member of both committees, said when asked if he was satisfied with the investigation. ""We are finally getting there,"" he added, referring to Strzok's Wednesday interview. ""But we should have been interviewing people a lot sooner than this -- I have been very clear about that.""

Asked why it's taken so long, Jordan said: ""I don't do the subpoenas, I don't do the interviews -- that has to go through the chairmen of the committee. ... We just keep asking, and we just keep waiting.""

Meadows added: ""The fact that we are just now interviewing Peter Strzok, and we have yet to schedule Lisa Page ... would suggest a less-than-aggressive time frame to complete the investigation.""

So far, the committees have also held only four interviews as part of the FBI probe. After high-profile interviews in December with then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and January with James Comey's former chief of staff James Rybicki, the committees went dark on interviews for several months.

They've kicked back up with a new series of interviews of FBI officials in the past month, including FBI director of counterintelligence Bill Priestap and John Giacalone, who was the FBI's top national security official during the first part of the Clinton email investigation. Sources in both parties acknowledge that the witness interviews have provided little information beyond what is already publicly known.

""I personally don't think they've turned up a whole lot in these interviews, and obviously, they've been trying to hold these interviews in part to discredit the FBI and Jim Comey,"" said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat on the House Oversight Committee who has attended all the witness interviews. ""The interviews are just not producing evidence or testimony that will support their hypothesis.""

More interviews are likely on tap, as the committees earlier this month sent the Justice Department a list of nearly a dozen FBI and Justice Department officials they want to interview, which included Strzok, according to a letter obtained by CNN.

Yet there are ample concerns that many of these key witnesses have already been interviewed by the inspector general, with Meadows saying that ""rehashing something"" already investigated by the inspector general is of ""little value."" Instead, the investigation, several conservative argue, should look at the actions taken over the Russia probe in 2016.

Leaders of the committee say the witness interviews have been slow because they've been trying to get documents first, arguing the Justice Department has refused to fully comply with their demands.

""The drama does not help anyone,"" Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who has yet to issue a subpoena as chairman of the Oversight Committee this Congress, said last week. ""So if you're going to produce it, produce it -- if you're not going to produce it let us know, that's helpful information, too. And then (House Speaker Paul Ryan) has to decide a number of things. But when you push the issue, you're not getting the documents, you're going to court.""

The fight with the Justice Department over documents -- which has also involved House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, a California Republican, battling over subpoenas for his investigation into the start of the FBI's Russia investigation in 2016 -- has prompted calls for the firing of Rosenstein from several of Mueller's most vocal critics in the House.

By making the threats, they've managed to extract a number of key documents from the Justice Department and FBI, but they've also let numerous deadlines come and go without full compliance with their subpoenas.

Gaetz, like several of his fellow conservatives, argues it's time to target Rosenstein, even by possibly impeaching him, and he wants his colleagues to take a firmer approach.

""If we were really serious about conducting oversight, we would be demanding the documents,"" Gaetz said.",Conservatives grumble about House GOP's handling of investigation into FBI,http://cnn.com/2018/06/25/politics/fbi-investigation-house-republicans-conservatives/index.html
170,170,2018-02-22 00:00:00,cnn.com,"CNN national security analyst John Kirby is a retired rear admiral in the US Navy who was a spokesman for both the State and Defense departments in the Obama administration. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) Australia is America's closest ally in the Pacific region and a strong trading partner. Relations between our two countries -- even in the midst of President Trump's ""America First"" agenda -- remain warm and cordial. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has been trumpeting his country's "" 100 years of mateship "" with the United States, harkening back to American-Australian comradeship in World War I.

So, as meetings go this week, Trump's Friday get-together with Turnbull should be one of his easiest. But on two issues in particular -- China and trade -- Trump might find his lunch mate from down under a bit of a tough sell.

By all accounts, it would appear both men have moved past the brouhaha last year when Trump complained bitterly to Turnbull about the deal President Obama struck in the waning days of his administration to permit the entry of more than 1,200 South Asian and Rohingya refugees that Australia had been harboring.

In a testy telephone exchange , Trump called it a ""disgusting deal"" that embarrassed the United States and would cause him political problems at home.

""Where do they come from?"" he roared about the refugees. ""Are they going to become the Boston bomber in five years? Or two years? Who are these people?""

To its credit, the Trump administration has resettled -- albeit quietly -- some of those refugees.

That little unpleasantness aside, US-Australian relations continue apace, reinforced by robust military exchanges, sales and exercises; mutual support to increase pressure on North Korea; cooperation against ISIS in Iraq and against the Taliban in Afghanistan; and, of course, a united front against China's moves to militarize the South China Sea.

On the latter, Turnbull warned last June in a speech at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue security conference that a ""coercive China would find its neighbors resenting demands they cede their autonomy and strategic space and look to counterweight Beijing's power by bolstering alliances and partnerships between themselves and especially with the United States.""

China differences

But in the main, Trump should expect to hear a more nuanced approach to China's rise than the one he himself espouses. China is Australia's largest trading partner in both imports and exports. And, according to the Australian government, fully 25% of Australia's manufactured imports come from China and 13% of its exports are thermal coal to China. So, quite literally, Australia can ill afford to mismanage its approach to China's rise as both a military and economic power.

Neither can Trump, though. The US trade deficit with China climbed last year to $375.2 billion , the highest level ever recorded. But while Trump's National Security Strategy labels China ""a strategic competitor using predatory economics to intimidate its neighbors,"" Australia's 2017 Foreign Policy White Pape r takes a more nuanced view, welcoming ""China's greater capacity to share responsibility for supporting regional and global security.""

Just last month, after the release of Trump's National Security Strategy, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop went to great pains to distance her government from the American view.

""We do not see Russia or China as posing a military threat to Australia,"" she told reporters . ""We undertake military exercises with China as well as other countries in the region and will continue to do so.""

Trade imbalances

Turnbull will, no doubt, be interested in drawing the President out on just how far he is willing to go to adjust the trade imbalance with China. There's genuine concern in many corners that the administration seeks a trade war by imposing high tariffs on goods from China. Trump already slapped tariffs on solar panels -- an industry dominated by China -- and his commerce secretary is weighing options to do the same on steel and aluminum

President Obama tried a similar tack in 2009, instituting a 35% tariff on Chinese tires after American companies complained about unfair competition. It saved more than a thousand US jobs in that industry but, according to a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics , dramatically raised the price of tires, costing Americans more than $1 billion, or roughly the equivalent of 3,700 retail jobs lost.

And we can expect the Chinese to retaliate with damaging tariffs of their own. They did it in 2009 (by imposing penalties on US shipments of chicken parts), and they will do it again. Of the pending Commerce Department decisions on steel and aluminum, Wang Hejun, China's chief of the Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau, made clear that ""if the final decision impacts China's interests, China will certainly take necessary measures to protect its own rights.""

To be sure, the trade imbalance with China needs to be rectified, but it is difficult to see how anyone in the region, including Australia, stands to gain from a trade war between these two economic superpowers.

That's why it is highly probable the prime minister will want to revisit Trump's decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In the wake of that decision, the TPP was reborn as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and now includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.

Without the powerhouse that is the US economy, this new multilateral arrangement, while important, will remain hobbled in its ability to act as an effective counterweight to China.

For his part, Trump should stand firm by his concerns over China's intentions in the region, concerns that are reflected in his decision to name Adm. Harry Harris, the current commander of the US Pacific Command and a China critic, to serve as ambassador to Australia.

He should reiterate the assessment of his national security team that the militaristic manner in which China is rising today threatens regional stability and warrants a return to the development of robust deterrent and conventional US military capabilities.

North Korea figures prominently here as well, given the accelerated pace at which the Kim Jong Un regime continues to develop its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and the anemic nature with which China uses its considerable influence on the regime.

Under President Obama, the US military shifted a considerable amount of resources into the Pacific region to specifically address these threats, including a contingent of Marines in Australia. Those were sound decisions then and are even more sound today. And Trump has ably reinforced them.

Of course, Australians do not need to be reminded of the increased threat. They live it every day. They know they benefit greatly from a robust American military presence nearby (though, in the wake of Trump's continued assault on the intelligence community and the dysfunction in his White House over security clearances, one could forgive the Aussies for a smattering of wariness over the depth of their intelligence sharing with the United States).

In any event, Trump should make no apologies for the more hawkish tone his administration has been taking, particularly against China.

On trade, one hopes Turnbull can persuade Trump to become more dovish -- to enter the CPTPP and to more carefully consider the dangers and damage a trade war with China might bring.

Trump told reporters at the World Economic Forum last month that he would be willing to reconsider TPP ""if we were able to make a substantially better deal."" But it's not clear what constitutes a better deal in Trump's mind. Perhaps Turnbull can extract some of that context from our chief executive.

These statements go beyond breaking the norms of civil discourse; they are dangerous, as they can be misinterpreted as a call to physical action or harm against an individual and people who associate with them.

Seven of the rockets were intercepted by the Iron Dome aerial defense system, IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus said Wednesday. Three landed in populated areas and a fourth landed close to a kindergarten, but no children were there at the time, Conricus said. There were no reports of any Israeli injuries.

In response, Israeli fighter jets struck 25 military targets in Gaza, including four compounds belonging to Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza, according to the IDF.

The IDF blamed Hamas for Tuesday's rocket launches, accusing the group in a statement of ""dragging the Gaza Strip and its civilians down a continually deteriorating path,"" adding that Hamas would ""bear the consequences for deliberately targeting its terror at Israeli civilians.""

Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told CNN that the rockets were a response to previous Israeli shelling. ""Israel has carried out military actions in response to peaceful demonstrations on the border and shelling of places belonging to the resistance,"" Qassem said, adding that Palestinians have ""a natural right"" to respond to those actions.

An explosion is seen in northern Gaza City after an airstrike by Israeli forces on June 20, 2018.

(CNN) Every week, I offer a glimpse of the kind of intelligence assessments that are likely to come across the desk of the president of the United States.

Modeled on the President's Daily Briefing, or PDB, which the director of national intelligence prepares for the president almost daily, my Presidential Weekly Briefing focuses on the topics and issues President Trump needs to know to make informed decisions.

Here's this week's briefing:

Russia's having a ball

With National Security Adviser John Bolton in Russia this week, we assess that the Russian government is having a ball -- and it's not just because they are hosting the World Cup.

Vladimir Putin is the hottest ticket in town this summer. Ahead of your own meeting with Putin in July, it is clear that a bilateral meeting between the two of you is not a unique matchup -- he's inviting everyone he can to play ball. He's had a steady drumbeat of meetings with all of America's friends, from France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Angela Merkel to Japan's Shinzo Abe and India's Narendra Modi. Even if he's in the penalty box for hacking elections around the world , accusations of poisoning former Russian spies in the UK and supporting Assad, Putin's roster is full of world leaders who are keen to meet, talk shop, and sign some real deals.

Our ally President Moon of South Korea just met Putin in Russia. This is the first time a South Korean President has made an official visit to Russia since 1999 . This was a major move by Moon, likely aimed at maintaining momentum on the diplomatic denuclearization track (Putin's a big supporter of diplomacy with North Korea). But Putin likely considers Moon's visit to Russia another score for himself; with his Cold War-era, rose-colored glasses, he probably sees this visit as one more US ally moving closer to Russia.

He will use every opportunity at his disposal to meet, cajole, and strategize with other heads of state -- bonus points when it's with our allies. He'll use US policy decisions on tariffs and Iran alongside economic and investment carrots to build up team Russia, which means an emptier bench for us.

As you prepare for your own bilateral with Putin, we want to flag that alongside this positive momentum externally, there is some domestic rain on Putin's parade. Russian state pollsters have shown his favorability declining, with some figures putting his approval at 72%, down from 79% last month. Putin is expected to raise the retirement age soon from 63 to 65 for men and from 55 to 60 for women, which could be partially responsible for his declining popularity. But, it's all relative -- Putin doesn't run a democracy, so dips in public approval are just a minor bump in the road. Don't expect him to be swayed.

Erdogan: Oops, he did it again

Mr. President you may need to get ready for Recep Tayyip Erdogan unplugged. In Sunday's election , the President of Turkey was elected to serve another term. But with expanded executive authority, we assess he will be more aggressive internally and in pursuing Turkey's external agenda in places like Syria.

Turks went to the polls Sunday to cast their votes in snap presidential and parliamentary elections . President Erdogan purposefully called these elections a year early because he thought he had a good chance to beat out any opposition.

By no coincidence, before this snap election Erdogan backed a massive constitutional overhaul that gives the Turkish president more executive powers. A narrow majority of Turks endorsed it in a referendum, so Erdogan can now rule with more power

For 15 years, first as prime minister and now as president, Erdogan has weakened democracy in Turkey by consistently consolidating power and curtailing democratic freedoms like a free press and judiciary system. Turkey is still under a state of emergency, which Erdogan put in place after the failed coup attempt in 2016.

Fresh off a win, we should expect more Erdogan unplugged. The Erdogan executive presidency means no prime minister, and Erdogan could now legally issue decrees unencumbered and have more authority over the supposedly independent judiciary and civil service .

Immigration: It's no walk in the park

Illegal immigrants' lives, and their journeys to our southern border, are no walk through Central Park.

Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook

These immigrants are often fleeing unstable and unsafe conditions at home, and they encounter violence on their journey to our southern border. One independent study by Doctors Without Borders found that 68% of migrants treated had been the victim of violence during their transit through Mexico, and the US Fund for UNICEF reported that ""thousands of children from Central America risk being kidnapped, trafficked, raped, or killed"" on their journey away from gang violence and poverty in their home countries.

Mexico: Mexicans remain the largest origin group among illegal immigrants, but their overall percentage of the total number of illegal immigrants has been declining since 2007, when they accounted for 57% of the total. In 2016 they made up just about half . Various factors drive illegal immigration by Mexicans: poverty numbers in Mexico are estimated by the CIA at about 46% of the population, high crime rates are fueling drug and gang-related violence, and 2017 was the most murderous year on record. These are all drivers of illegal immigration.

Your State Department issued a multiyear US Strategy for Central America which aims to enhance US security by addressing the real drivers of illegal immigration. Below is a snapshot of some of those economic and security drivers. We assess that addressing these underlying conditions in origin countries will be the real deterrent to illegal immigration.

Honduras: 30% of the population in Honduras lives in poverty, and the population is plagued by ""alarming levels of crime and violence."" It is a prime transit point for the ""smuggling of arms, drugs, and people"" and governance structures are weak. With 55% of Hondurans living in cities, illegal immigrants from Honduras tend to come from urban centers which are gripped by gang violence. Gender-based violence against women is also a real issue, with one report indicating that it is the second-leading cause of death for women of reproductive age.

Guatemala: With the largest population in Central America -- around 15 million people -- Guatemala also faces high levels of violence. The State Department notes that Guatemalans are gripped by ""endemic poverty, food insecurity, severe violence, citizen insecurity."" USAID estimates that one of every two children under the age of five are chronically malnourished and reports publicly that Guatemala is a transit country for human traffickers, drugs, and contraband. Homicide rates have remained above 34 per 100,000 for the past decade.","Mr. President, get ready for Erdogan unplugged",http://cnn.com/2018/06/24/opinions/presidential-weekly-briefing-erdogan-unplugged-vinograd/index.html
175,175,2018-05-31 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) In the nutritional world, the benefits of cow's milk are well-known: It's a good source of several important nutrients, including protein, calcium and vitamin D, and an important staple for children.

But despite its winning nutrient profile, cow's milk doesn't always have a place within one's diet. Take vegans, who avoid food from all animals, or people who have an allergy to milk protein. Or the large percentage of individuals who have trouble digesting lactose, the sugar in milk, and prefer something other than dairy milks that may be more easily digested.

Non-dairy milks, including soy, almond, rice and coconut milk, are juices from nuts, seeds, grains and legumes that are often fortified with vitamins and minerals in an attempt to deliver the equivalent nutrient profile and sometimes taste and consistency of cow's milk.

These plant-based ""milks"" have become increasingly popular and serve as a welcome alternative for those who can't tolerate or choose not to consume cow's milk. According to market research analysis , half of Americans consume these milks, including 68% of parents and 54% of children younger than 18. But how well do these ""milks"" compare to the real thing?

Nutrients in dairy vs. non-dairy milks

Cow's milk can be considered the nutritional gold standard. It's high in protein; provides a good mix of key nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, potassium, riboflavin, folate and vitamin B12 and is fortified with vitamin D, according to Vandana Sheth, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

An 8-ounce serving of whole milk provides 8 grams of protein -- that's about 60% of the Recommended Daily Allowance for toddlers and 40% of the RDA for young children. But it's not just quantity that matters when it comes to protein: The quality matters, too. Cow's milk is considered a high-quality protein because it contains all of the essential amino acids required by the human body.

Though non-dairy beverages are often substituted for cow's milk, ""they are not able to completely mimic the nutritional profile,"" Sheth said. For example, rice milk, coconut milk and almond milk provide minimal amounts of protein. And if the dairy alternative is not fortified with vitamins such as calcium, D and B12, you might be missing those, Sheth explained.

So if you can't consume the cow, what's the next best beverage?

Soy milk: The best 'milk' alternative

A study published in the Journal of Food Science and Technology that compared the nutritional content of plant-based milks concluded that ""nutritionally soy milk is the best alternative for replacing cow's milk in the human diet.""

Based on the study, an 8-ounce glass of soy milk contains 7 to 12 grams of protein, ""which is the highest among all the alternate milk options available."" Soy milk's calories are also comparable to those in reduced-fat cow's milk and range from 80 to 100 calories per serving for unsweetened versions.

Though soy milk may be a good non-dairy alternative to cow's milk, it's important to ""ensure that it is fortified with calcium and vitamins D and B12, especially if you are following a vegan diet,"" Sheth said.

Almond, rice, coconut and hemp milk

Almond milk is a good source of heart-healthy fats and vitamins E and A. It is also lower in calories than cow or soy milk (unsweetened versions range from 30 to 50 calories per serving, according to the study), which can be helpful if you're watching calories from beverages.

However, fewer calories also means fewer nutrients, including protein, which can be as low as 1 gram for an 8-ounce serving of almond milk. So if you have a soy allergy or you prefer the taste of almond milk, ""you will need to plan on getting your protein from other food sources,"" Sheth noted.

On the flip side, rice milk is rich in carbohydrates, which contribute a higher amount of calories: up to 140 calories per cup. It is naturally sweet and can serve as an option for those allergic to soy and nuts. However, as starch contributes almost all of its calories, rice milk is also low in protein and fats.

It's not uncommon to find high calorie counts coupled with fewer nutrients. But unlike naturally sweet rice milk, oftentimes, sugar is added to improve the taste of milk, without additional nutrients.

""If you have an unsweetened version and sweetened version of almond milk, the sweetened version might not necessarily have more almonds in it. But, for sure, it will have added sugar in it,"" said Sai Kranthi Kumar Vanga, who authored the study on plant-based milks and is a PhD candidate in the department of bioresource engineering at McGill University.

Unsweetened coconut milk has fewer calories than cow's milk (it ranges from 45 to 60 calories per cup), but sweetened versions might have calories similar to 2% milk's, depending on the sugar content, according to Vanga.

Most of the calories in unsweetened coconut milk come from saturated fat, though at least one study found that saturated fat from coconut milk may not have a detrimental effect on blood cholesterol levels. Coconut milk also lacks protein and has very few carbohydrates.

Hemp milk may be an appealing option for vegans since it is a good source of omega-3 fats, Sheth said; however, ""ensure that it is fortified with calcium and vitamins D and B12, and know that it will again not be a good source of protein.""

A newer alternative, pea-protein-based ripple milk, is promising, as its nutritional composition is similar to cow's milk, however, ""further research is needed to assess the pea protein quality,"" according to Dr. Sarita Singhal, a pediatric gastroenterologist at the Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts, who has researched the nutritional value of plant-based milk alternatives

Bioavailability of nutrients in milk

There is also the issue of bioavailability in plant-based milks, which refers to the actual amount of a nutrient that will be absorbed once it enters the body. For example, calcium is often added to plant-based milks to mimic levels present in cow's milk, but that doesn't mean all of it is absorbed and therefore available to be used for its intended purpose.

As something that might impact bioavailability, consider ""antinutrients"" in soy -- compounds that can combine with proteins or minerals in foods and make them unavailable for absorption. For example, phytic acid in soy can prevent minerals such as calcium, zinc and magnesium from being absorbed, Vanga said. ""And unless the human body can absorb a particular compound, you are not benefiting from it.""

""Adding calcium to a product does not guarantee nutritional equivalence with other products containing similar amounts of calcium because the bioavailability of calcium varies significantly in fortified beverages,"" Singhal added.

To optimize your intake of nutrients with plant-based milks, its important to shake the carton well before you pour, since vitamins and minerals may settle at the bottom, Sheth explained.

Infants and toddlers

Until the age of 2, the only suitable milk beverage for ideal growth and development and to prevent nutritional deficiencies in children (other than breastfeeding) is whole cow's milk or formula. If your child is sensitive or allergic to cow's milk, specialized hypoallergenic formulas can be considered, Sheth explained. A plant-based milk should be considered only after the age of 2.

""If you do choose to provide a plant-based milk to your child [and] if over the age of 2, I would suggest soy, as it provides about 6 to 8 grams of protein per cup,"" she said. ""It's also a good idea to consult with a registered dietitian to discuss your child's unique situation and get guidance about the right choice to allow for normal growth and development.""

Taste matters

Nutrition aside, the taste of non-dairy milks can vary greatly. Vanga's study noted that the ""beany flavor"" of soy milk can be problematic for some.

""Soy milk has been on the market for decades, but there have been numerous reports which showed that people are moving away from soy milk primarily because of the taste,"" Vanga said. Almond milk and other plant-based milks have gained traction and captured the market, as they have a ""better flavor profile compared to soy milk.""

So if you opt for non-dairy milk, the type you choose will depend on your personal preference and what nutrients you're trying to replace by consuming it. But whichever you pick, be sure to read labels carefully, and seek out other foods for those nutrients that fall short.",How plant-based milk alternatives compare,http://cnn.com/2018/05/31/health/alternative-milk-food-drayer/index.html

(CNN) This Englishman living in New York has become wearily accustomed to Americans claiming credit for British inventions and achievements.

All the mythmaking at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown can't change the fact that the sport is based on rounders , a game for children in the UK. Thomas Edison may have produced the first commercial lightbulb, but it was an Englishman -- Humphry Davy -- who came up with the arc lamp, and another Brit -- Warren De la Rue -- who turned it into a bulb.

Disastrous colonial adventures overseas? Rest assured, we've been doing it for a lot longer than you have.

Which is why I find Donald Trump's latest blunder all the more egregious.

During an apparently difficult call to discuss import tariffs with Justin Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister, Trump reached into his historical locker as he searched for just the right metaphor to express his national security concerns about those notoriously restive neighbors to the north.

He reportedly asked : ""Didn't you guys burn down the White House?""

Doh. You don't need me to tell you that those ""guys"" were in fact British troops setting about the time-honored tradition of trashing anything we could not hold.

He may not have been claiming the action for America. But it still hurts. How could he get it so wrong?

If I were a forgiving man, one who assumed the American President knew his colonial history and the course of the War of 1812, I would give him the benefit of the doubt. Back then all Canadians were Brits, of course. Maybe that's what he was getting at.

But sadly I'm not generally given to this kind of charity and thus tend to the view that your commander-in-chief knows chuff all about the War of 1812. Not even the fact that it ran for almost three years. (I kid you not. Look it up on Wikipedia.)

As such, the blunder cuts the expat Brit to the quick. Can we not even be afforded our little bit of fun as we slip from relevance in the world? Do we not get our chance to remember that we were once capable of burning the seat of power of the mighty United States, if only quickly, fruitlessly and (if I remember ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" correctly) mostly at night?

For the burning down of the White House remains a favorite punchline among British diplomats, journalists and politicians in Washington.

It is only a few years since the British embassy was forced to issue an apology for posting a photograph of the White House in cake form surrounded by sparklers.

177,177,2018-06-20 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) President Trump's recent declaration that North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat , despite a lack of verifiable proof that the regime will put an end to its nuclear program, has not completely quelled national security concerns about nuclear war.

But fewer people may be keeping an eye on another, potentially bigger danger: anthrax.

""The way that people think about [nuclear weapons] is on a much, much grander scale than biological weapons, and I think that's a misperception,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja , a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""If you use a contagious infectious disease, you really could create havoc on a different scale.""

Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of Columbia University's National Center for Disaster Preparedness, noted that ""the ability to weaponize anthrax is out there. It's a question of time, hopefully a really long time.

""Would I be surprised if we had a release now? I'd be shocked and horrified but not surprised,"" he said, adding that if anthrax were released on the subway in New York City, for example, it would spread like wildfire.

As part of an ongoing effort to be prepared, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will review on Wednesday its recommendations for mass vaccination in the event of an anthrax attack.

Redlener notes that the United States is better prepared for a biological threat now than it was 20 years ago. ""We've come a long way since 2001,"" Adalja added.

'Short memories'

""Those of us who were [in Washington DC] during the fall of 2001 vividly recall the chaos that a few small envelopes of anthrax caused on Capitol Hill,"" Colorado Rep. Diana DeGette said Friday at a congressional hearing on the country's preparedness for pandemics and biological attacks. ""Offices were closed, buildings were fumigated, some congressional business was suspended, and thousands of staffers and other personnel lined up for days to get tested for exposure. ""Far worse, some of the workers at our postal service were affected and died.""

A corporate mailroom employee in New York City uses gloves while sifting through letters in October 2001.

Adalja, who is also an infectious disease doctor, said the 2001 attacks ""really showed how unprepared we were."" But they also led to a surge in funding and initiatives that sought to make the United States more resilient to future attacks: new vaccines, new medications, diagnostic tests and emergency hospital plans.

After September 11, the agency also began systematically collecting information from emergency departments, looking for any patterns of a bioterrorism attack. At the nexus of the country's biopreparedness is the CDC, which has activated an emergency response, or ""incident management system,"" 67 times over the past 16 years for a variety of infectious threats including Ebola and Zika outbreaks.After September 11, the agency also began systematically collecting information from emergency departments, looking for any patterns of a bioterrorism attack.

""Those investments are paying dividends, as this information technology system now allows officials to detect a wide range of health threats beyond biological attacks, from opioid overdoses to chemical exposures to disease outbreaks,"" Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's principal deputy director, said in prepared testimony for Friday's congressional hearing, where policymakers sought to renew funding for biopreparedness legislation.

Despite these gains, support and funding for these programs may not be keeping pace with an intensifying threat, Adalja said.

""When things slip from headlines -- and anthrax hasn't been in the headlines for quite a long time -- people don't necessarily give it the same type of importance,"" he said. ""This threat hasn't gone away. The threat has actually gotten worse since 2001.""

A hazardous-materials worker sprays his colleagues on October 23, 2001, after emerging from an anthrax search on Capitol Hill.

Critics have lambasted the Trump administration for proposing budget cuts to public health programs, including the CDC.

""People have very short memories, and policymakers do as well,"" Adalja said.

Redlener warned that ""we're in the zone of the unimaginable things that have to do with preventing and preparing for the most horrible threats.""

A persistent bacterium

Anthrax is caused by a bacterium -- Bacillus anthracis -- that can persist in soil, water and, most infamously, long journeys through the mail system.

""It's not just this bacteria that replicates in people, but in the environment, it has this spore form that lasts a long time and makes it easier to perhaps use as a weapon,"" said Dr. Henry Walke , chief of the CDC's Bacterial Special Pathogens Branch.

On the skin, the bacteria can cause blisters and ulcers with a black center. If swallowed, it may cause diarrhea or bloody vomiting. If inhaled, it may initially look like a bad case of the flu.

Survivors of the 2001 attacks have reported enduring health problems long after they were treated and cured.

Bacillus anthracis spores can become ""activated"" once in the body, where bacteria can multiply and release toxins, according to the CDC.

Under the microscope, the bacteria look like tiny rods. The CDC classifies them as a Category A agent : one that poses the greatest possible threat for a negative impact on public health, one that may spread across a large area or need public awareness and requires planning to protect the public's health.

Mathematical models have raised the possibility that anthrax spores, if aerosolized, can spread over big cities and ""result in a mass-casualty incident involving hundreds of thousands of illnesses and deaths,"" according to previous CDC guidance. This could strain national stockpiles of antibiotics and lead to a shortage of the vaccine.

In a February meeting, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices discussed ways to stretch out doses of anthrax vaccines and antibiotics during a large-scale event, for which Walke noted ""there's not an imminent threat.""

""We have more information about how the vaccine works, how effective is it is ... if there was an event that required a massive vaccination of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people,"" Walke said.

""Not even the exposure we had in 2001,"" Adalja said. ""We're talking about the Super Bowl or something like that.""

Adalja said there is evidence that a shortened course of treatment works, and it may be more effective in the long run because ""it's very hard for people to comply"" with a full 60 days of antibiotics that can cause unpleasant side effects. Some of these recommendations stem from a time before we had an anthrax vaccine, he added.

American soldiers in Kuwait City receive anthrax vaccinations in March 1998.

The CDC advisory committee is expected to revisit these measures and vote on options at its meeting Wednesday. The committee will also discuss vaccines for human papillomavirus, Japanese encephalitis and influenza.

""We haven't updated the recommendations for vaccines since 2010, and since that time now, eight years later, we have more information about the vaccine,"" Walke said.

But there's still a long way to go in terms of preparedness, Redlener said, adding that no city is fully prepared.

Questions remain about what dosage of the vaccine to use for children, the safety of the vaccine for the general public, delivery and distribution of the vaccine and medications.

""I think a vaccination program would be a nightmare. Who would administer it? Who would pay for it? Who would manufacture it? The cost of complications that may occur. I don't think it would be practical,"" Redlener said.

But anthrax, which is not contagious, may be only the tip of the iceberg. There are other weaponizable microbes, including smallpox and tularemia , that experts are concerned about. And there's the prospect of genetically engineered viruses, which Bill Gates warned about at an international security conference last year.

""The next epidemic could originate on the computer screen of a terrorist intent on using genetic engineering to create a synthetic version of the smallpox virus ... or a super contagious and deadly strain of the flu,"" Gates said.

The man was identified as Tristan Beaudette of Irvine, California, Los Angeles County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said.

Beaudette was discovered at a campsite at Malibu Creek State Park after authorities received a report of gunfire around 4:45 a.m. Friday, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said.

Deputies arrived to find Beaudette ""had sustained at least one gunshot wound to his upper torso,"" according to LASD. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Winter said an autopsy is pending.

Beaudette's 2- and 4-year-old daughters were inside the tent with him, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. They were not injured, authorities said.

Detective Rodney Moore of the sheriff's department said no motive has been determined.

Authorities investigate the killing of a man at a state park in Southern California.

""There is no suspect information, no suspect vehicle,"" he said. ""We are not investigating this as a suicide at this point.""

""Homicide detectives are aware there have been other shootings near the location in the past, however there is no evidence that suggests this incident is related to any prior shootings near the location,"" the LASD said.

CNN affiliate KABC-TV detailed several of the other shootings at the park: A man said his car was hit by gunfire Monday morning. A woman told authorities in January 2017 she heard a loud noise in the middle of the night and found a bullet hole in the back of her car. There are also reports of a man being shot at the park in 2016.

According to his LinkedIn page, Beaudete was an associate director at the pharmaceutical company Allergan. The LinkedIn bio also says Beaudette received a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley and had seven years experience in late-stage pharmaceutical drug product development.

180,180,2018-06-24 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program ""The Dean Obeidallah Show"" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @DeanObeidallah . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) This week we saw two different ways people sent messages that they passionately oppose the Trump administration's policies. And both involved prominent Trump officials and restaurants.

On Tuesday night, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, while dining at a Mexican restaurant in Washington D.C., was heckled by protesters over her defense of Donald Trump's immoral family separations at the border. And on Friday night, according to a tweet by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, she was politely asked to leave a Lexington, Virginia, restaurant by its owner because of her work defending Trump and his policies.

Those shocked by these types of protests simply don't grasp the level of emotion that many who oppose Trump feel. I hear it nightly on my SiriusXM radio show and see it firsthand on social media. Even Trump, in a rare moment of honesty, told his supporters a few weeks ago that those who oppose him are not just angry, but "" really, really angry ."" Many view Trump as a true threat to America.

So it should come as no surprise that some would also look to hold members of Team Trump responsible as well. After all, Trump administration officials who defend Trump's bigoted policies, his demonization of minority groups and his lies, are complicit. They freely choose to do the work for him and they shouldn't be shocked if some -- not all --Trump opponents lash out at them.

But let's make it clear, this is not about asking someone to leave or heckling them simply because they are Republicans or conservatives. That would be wrong. This is about targeting people who are very publicly involved in formulating and defending Trump's immoral policies.

In fact, the people who heckled Secretary Nielsen didn't yell: ""Get out of here because you're a Republican."" No, their chants were very specific to Trump's family separation immigration policy she had been publicly defending just days before, telling Nielsen : ""Do you hear the babies crying?"" and ""If kids don't eat in peace, you don't eat in peace."" That is literally speaking truth to power.

Stephanie Wilkinson, the owner of the Red Hen restaurant, who had asked press secretary Sanders to leave, told the media on Saturday that she is ""not a huge fan of confrontation,"" adding, ""I have a business, and I want the business to thrive."" But as Wilkinson rightly noted , ""This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.""

Wilkinson further explained her approach to handling the situation. She first spoke with her employees, who disagreed with Sanders' defense of Trump's discriminatory ban on transgender Americans who want to serve in the military and her recent defense of Trump's un-American family separation policy.

In response , she then asked Sanders to step outside to the patio and ""explained that the restaurant has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty, and compassion, and cooperation."" Clearly, Sanders doesn't comply with that standard.

As a progressive, I feel that denying service to a person is instinctively troubling. For many, it may conjure up laws that banned blacks from being served at restaurants before the Civil Rights Act and the current campaign by some on the right to turn away same-sex couples who want professional services for their weddings. Or even a gun range owner who declared that no Muslims were allowed on the premises.

But the situations with Sanders and even Nielsen are not even in the same universe as these discriminatory examples. No one is targeting them for their race, religion or sexual orientation. The backlash is because they have freely chosen to be a part of the Trump administration and have personally defended Trump's policies. In fact, Nielsen has served up lies while championing Trump's family separation policies while Sanders even invoked the Bible, telling reporters , ""it is very biblical to enforce the law.""

I understand why some people targeted high-profile Trump administration officials, but I am concerned about what will we see in response. Newton's third law of motion -- ""For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction"" -- applies not just to physics, but perfectly to our hyperpartisan nation. Given our politics today, that law should actually be updated to: ""For every action, there's an overreaction.""

How long until Trump's fans counter by hanging signs in their stores, restaurants and bars that read ""No liberals allowed"" or ""Trump supporters only."" I bet that would play well in certain red states. And would progressives in blue states respond in kind?

From a legal point of view, a person can be asked to leave a privately owned establishment because of their political views. For example, In April, a judge in New York City dismissed a lawsuit by a Trump supporter who wore a ""Make American Great Again"" hat to a bar and was asked to leave.

But applying this to the average American divides us even more as a nation and makes it less likely that we can ever return to being the United States of America.

Going forward, it's likely that we will see more people speak out against Trump officials who publicly defend his cruel policies.

182,182,2018-06-24 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Chef Brandon Baltzley has struggled with substance abuse for most of his adult life. He loves his job, he says. But the restaurant industry's high-stress, fast-paced culture fueled his appetite for drugs and alcohol as he rose through restaurants in Washington, New York and Chicago.

Journalists charted his stumbles through vivid descriptions of his benders. He was an ""enfant terrible,"" the chef who lost opportunities because of his drug addiction. An article in 2011 headlined ""A chef's painful road to rehab"" was the best and worst thing to happen to him, he says. It got him a book deal and turned him into a spokesman for the industry's struggle with substance abuse, even as he continued to struggle himself.

Baltzley's highs and lows may sound familiar to those who've read Anthony Bourdain's early writing on the restaurant industry's culture of excess. Most anyone who's worked in a restaurant, including Baltzley, can relate to wild binge-drinking and drug-fueled escapades of ""Kitchen Confidential.""

Such behavior has come to be regarded as an occupational hazard, Baltzley says. He and others in the industry want to change that by speaking openly about substance abuse, mental health and the relationship between the two, and by letting others know that it's OK to be sober in the business.

Baltzley says crack, cocaine and alcohol masked the lingering effects of unresolved childhood trauma and provided a short-term salve for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. But to maintain the numbing effect, he kept using, even as his career took off. He managed to stay sober for months at a time, once for a full year. His latest binge-drinking streak lasted for nearly five years, until January.

He had a wife, an 18-month-old daughter and a restaurant slated to open in April on Cape Cod. Yet, at just 33 years old, his liver was failing, he says.

""I was dying,"" he said. ""I needed to figure out, 'Am I going to drink and kill myself? Am I going to keep doing this until I'm done? Or do I try to turn this around?' ""

Chef Brandon Baltzley struggled with addiction for years.

Baltzley says that for him, substance abuse was a symptom of deeper emotional health issues. And restaurant workers who escape the cycle of addiction still face enormous pressure to satisfy customers, co-workers and supervisors. The pressure only gets heavier as one becomes more successful, he said.

Baltzley awoke June 8 to find his phone lighting up with messages and voice mails. Had he heard about Bourdain? Was he OK?

Bourdain's death shocked him, he said -- but it didn't really surprise him.

""We live in a complicated world. I can't imagine what it's like to have every single person in the industry wait for your opinion on every ... matter. He's only human. That's a lot of pressure,"" he said.

""Some will say he chose that path or whatever, but I'd like to think that some people just go with the flow, be it healthy for them or not, because they think it's what they're supposed to do.""

An industry looks at itself in the mirror

Bourdain's death came in the midst of what some consider a disruptive period for the restaurant industry. For one, it's dealing with shockwaves from #MeToo, the movement to stem sexual harassment, which has entangled culinary heavyweights including Mario Batali and John Besh.

Asking for help The suicide rate in the United States has seen sharp increases in recent years. Studies have shown that the risk of suicide declines sharply when people call the national suicide hotline: 1-800-273-TALK. There is also a crisis text line. For crisis support in Spanish, call 1-888-628-9454. The lines are staffed by a mix of paid professionals and unpaid volunteers trained in crisis and suicide intervention. The confidential environment, the 24-hour accessibility, a caller's ability to hang up at any time and the person-centered care have helped its success, advocates say.



The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.

Before #MeToo, a quieter industry reckoning was underway to alleviate the stigma surrounding mental illness and its symptoms, including substance abuse. Renowned chefs including Sean Brock and Seamus Mullins, known as much for their hard-partying stamina as for their culinary prowess, have spoken publicly about their efforts to stay clean and sober.

The website Chefs With Issues provides a venue for industry workers to share stories of their struggles. Its founder, Kat Kinsman, gives talks on the topic at industry gatherings and closed-door sessions across the country.

""Chefs die all the time and no one talks about it,"" she wrote in Food and Wine after Bourdain's death. ""There are a million reasons for this, but the thing is that it happens constantly and it's only spoken of in hushed tones so no one gets upset. Other people's feelings are awkward, and we as a culture are exceptionally crappy at talking about them.""

Kinsman noted that, in recent years, Bourdain had acknowledged and expressed regret for his role in fostering the ""meathead bro culture"" that valorized self-abuse and workaholism.

""He spoke precisely and passionately about the failings of the industry -- his own included -- and the culture at large,"" she wrote. ""It's utterly terrifying, ripping open your chest to show the ugliest, darkest parts of yourself to someone who may not understand. But that is how the light gets in.""

Kinsman participated in sessions for industry workers at the Food & Wine Classic in Aspen and Atlanta Food and Wine Festival this month. When someone asked Atlanta participants to raise their hands if they or someone they knew in the industry had been affected by mental health or substance abuse issues, everyone had a hand in the air.

'I felt like I was the only one'

Such meetings are taking place with greater frequency across the country at industry gatherings and in casual meetings. In the Southeast, an organization called Ben's Friends is leading one of those efforts. It was formed by two industry veterans, each with more than a decade of sobriety, who say that now more than ever, their community is open to the conversation.

""It's time that we start talking about this and start offering to help. And if nothing else, providing a conversation that you can stay sober in the restaurant business. You're not doomed to a life of excess just because you want to be in hospitality,"" Ben's Friends co-founder Steve Palmer said in the lobby of Atlanta's Loews Hotel, headquarters of the Atlanta Food and Wine Festival.

The night before, Palmer and Ben's Friends co-founder Scott Crawford hosted a ""chill space"" at the festival for the second year in a row. At 10 p.m., the festival's VIP lounge overlooking Midtown Atlanta turned into an alcohol-free space for festival talent only. The organization has hosted similar spaces at the Charleston Wine and Food festival.

The crowd in Atlanta was small this year, Palmer said. But he knows from experience that helping just one person goes a long way.

Palmer, managing partner of Indigo Road Hospitality Group, attributes his success to his sobriety. Nearly 17 years ago, he kicked his addiction. Since then, he says, he felt like the ""lone dove"" even as his career took off. It took the death by suicide of a close friend and employee, Ben Murray, to compel him to act.

""Ben committing suicide was a moment for me to pause and really question some social norms that I had accepted about our business -- like this is just the way it is. Everybody does drugs; everybody parties,"" Palmer said.

Crawford, owner of Crawford and Sons in Raleigh, North Carolina, came down for one night to host the chill space with Palmer. He was grateful for the venue.

In 14 years of sobriety, Crawford said, he has also felt like an outsider in his community at various points -- like when he attended festivals such as this one.

""I became introverted at these things, which was the opposite of what I wanted to be,"" he said. ""This lobby at night becomes a who's-who of the Southeast, but there was always a time when I had to get out of there because I was on a different level from everyone else.""

Ben's Friends founders Steve Palmer, left, and Scott Crawford have hosted alcohol-free spaces at food and wine festivals.

Through Ben's Friends, he and Palmer say, they've discovered a community they didn't know existed.

""When I got sober, I got healthy. I got much better at what I was doing. I started to excel. ... But I felt like I was the only one,"" Crawford said. ""I wasn't, but I just didn't know. There was no network of people who were making the choice to be sober.""

These days, he and Palmer said, they're seeing more faces -- new and familiar -- at Ben's Friends meetings in Raleigh and Charleston. Why? The opioid epidemic is killing people faster at a time when food and hospitality are becoming more central to American life, Palmer said. The industry is more open to the conversation.

""The hospitality industry needs more people working in it, not less, and we need more emotionally sound, well people,"" he said. ""I also like to think there's been some evolution of our consciousness, that we care a little bit more about each other. And tragedy does propel you to have that conversation that, five years ago, you weren't willing to have.""

'It's never too late'

Kinsman invited Baltzley to speak at the closed-door session at the Atlanta festival. It was his second year in a row attending to share his wayward journey. But this year was a little different, he said: He was sober, and it showed.

It took 21 days of isolation in a cabin in Maine to reorient himself, he said. He confronted some of the trauma that was holding him back. He cried a lot. Now, he's 60 pounds lighter than he was when he spoke at the festival this time last year. His career is moving forward with the opening of his new restaurant, the Buffalo Jump, in East Falmouth, Massachusetts. Because he's the boss, no alcohol is served; it's BYOB.

(CNN) On Monday morning, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a speech at the Heritage Foundation in Washington: ""After the Deal: A New Iran Strategy."" Over 26 minutes, Pompeo articulated a strategy that can best be summarized as, ""Do everything we say, or we will crush you."" This speech was the first clear articulation of American Iran policy since President Donald Trump effectively withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (a.k.a. ""the Iran deal"") on May 12.

Now, self-proclaimed master deal maker President Trump has a new deal in mind for Iran, one that would effectively require Iran to change the very nature of its regime and reverse its core foreign policy principles -- deterring the United States, supporting Shias abroad and overturning the regional order.

Jonathan Cristol

The new deal on the table is a dream come true for many globally important figures: Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu; Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander Mohammed Ali Jafari; National Security Advisor John Bolton; and the Mujahideen-e-Khalq cult.

Under this strategy, articulated by Pompeo, the US enacts a new round of crippling sanctions that will have Iran ""battling to keep its economy alive."" Then Iran peacefully gives into US demands and changes the very nature of its regime.

It's all so easy it's a wonder no previous president thought of it.

(CNN) In the end it took innocent children -- or, as Time magazine depicts it , a single little girl -- to reveal the true Donald Trump to those who have resisted recognizing him. In the magazine's cover illustration, this tiny toddler stands in her pink sneakers, her sobbing face turned upward. Looking down, from his impassive height, Trump gazes as if at an insect or inanimate object. This is a man who can use the word "" infest "" as he regards fellow human beings.

Trump's reign of cruelty reached a sadistic crescendo this week as we learned that his administration had ordered more than 2,300 children, including nursing infants, torn from their parents and locked up. Their offense? Accompanying parents who claim refugee status as they cross America's southern border.

Those who were shocked to hear audio of wailing toddlers and see images of family separations haven't been paying close attention. Whether you consider the Polish workers treated like beasts of burden at his Trump Tower building site in 1980 or his nasty public divorce from his first wife, Ivana, in the early 1990s, Donald Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he is willing to sacrifice others for his own benefit and that he feels no shame about anything. Only a man with amoral instincts would mock a reporter's disability, as Trump did during his campaign. Only a supremely narcissistic leader would turn on essential allies and embrace despots, as Trump has, with so little regard for his country's moral standing.

Just last night Trump dismissively referred to his sometime opponent Senator John McCain, castigating him for his vote against repealing Obamacare. ""We had a gentlemen, way into the morning hours, go thumbs down,"" Trump said, without naming the senator, who is stricken with cancer. ""He went thumbs down."" One member of the audience shouted , ""He's a war hero! He's a war hero!""

A day earlier the President maintained his all-about-me focus when he met with Congressional Republicans to discuss the family separation scandal. In true bully fashion, he asked about the whereabouts of his antagonist, Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina. He was tweaking Sanford over his defeat in a recent primary. The quip was met with groans, as fellow Republicans couldn't stomach it . ""That's kind of kicking a man when he's down,"" a member of House who was in the meeting told CNN. ""That's not who we are.""

How is it that Trump carries on in this way, despite the disgrace and the rejection? As someone who has studied him for years, and spent ample time with Trump and his family, I keep coming back to the man's malformed character. Something in Trump's experience, or perhaps biology, interrupted the developmental process that creates in us the ability to care about others. In Trump's heart resides only himself. There is no room for a crying child.

The President understands that key elements of a person's personality are established early in life. Thus, the most chilling thing Donald Trump ever told me was that he believes that by age six he was the person he would always be. I thought of the fact that at age six he was a bully, whose status, as the son of one of the most powerful men in New York, made his deviance worse. In his book ""The Art of the Deal,"" Trump confessed that in second grade he gave a teacher a black eye. By the time he was thirteen he was so obviously out of control that his parents sent him off to military school for discipline.

Trump's mean streak, amplified by his money, allowed him to exploit others in love and business and, eventually, politics. As a candidate, his method thrilled many voters, who themselves responded like children in a bully's thrall, and as President he has attracted like-minded people to his service. Who but a bully's enabler would, as Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen did, insist that family separation wasn't Trump policy? Who but a like-minded bully like White House adviser Stephen Miller would describe the choice of separating families as a ""simple decision.""

The world is amply supplied with people like Miller, who seem to take pleasure in suffering. Consider Corey Lewandowski , Trump's former campaign manager now working to boost Vice President Mike Pence, who mocked the case of a ten-year-old disabled girl separated from her mother at the border -- or Pence himself, who professes Christian faith but stands by as children suffer.

Those who had defended the administration's handling of the immigration issue, like Pence, Lewandowski, Nielsen and others were in an uncomfortable position when Trump suddenly stopped the separation policy. (It's notable that there is no well thought-out plan for reuniting kids and parents already torn apart.) The fact that the President could pull the rug out from under these loyalists comes as no surprise. No amount of service is enough to win fair and equitable treatment from Donald Trump. Just ask former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, now in jail awaiting trial. The President now talks about him as if he barely knew him.

Manafort's experience proves that everything Trump does with fellow human beings is a transaction and that he expects every exchange to benefit him. It is proof that Republicans in Congress should consider, as they weigh working with a man whose ruthlessness knows no bounds. As the mental health experts who contact me daily say, this 72-year-old boy bully is only going to get worse. And the only choice for those who fear for their country, as well as the children, is to stand against him.","In Trump's heart, no room for a crying child",http://cnn.com/2018/06/21/opinions/trumps-new-height-of-cruelty-dantonio/index.html

Voters amended the state Constitution to allow medical sales in 2016

(CNN) Residents of Arkansas are one step closer to getting legal access to medical marijuana.

In 2016 , voters amended the state Constitution to allow patients there to use cannabis to treat certain ailments . The amendment allowed the state to create a Medical Marijuana Commission, and several residents applied for and received ID cards that would allow them to buy it. But the part of the law that allowed the state to give licenses to growers got tied up in the courts.

There were more than 80 applications from businesses that wanted to legally grow cannabis in the state. In February, the Medical Marijuana Commission decided to grant five licenses to the companies that had the top scores according to the law, but one of the competitors that did not get the nod sued, arguing that the license process was unfair. That effort was a success, and the process came to a halt.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court of Arkansas ruled that a lower court didn't have the authority to stop the licensing process.

With this decision, the state should be able to grant the growers licenses, and patients who qualify should be able to make legal purchases this year. Arkansas patients who qualify include those with cancer, glaucoma, Crohn's disease, Alzheimer's disease and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Chennai native R. Praggnanandhaa missed out on the title of the youngest grandmaster ever by just three months -- a distinction that is instead held by Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine, who achieved the honor in 2002 aged 12 years and seven months.

Praggnanandhaa entered the exclusive club of pre-teen grandmasters on Saturday when he won his eighth round game against 18-year-old Italian grandmaster Luca Moroni at the Gredine Open in Ortisei, Italy.

The following day, Praggnanandhaa beat his final opponent, Dutch grandmaster Roeland Pruijssers, to cement his status and pave the way as a future chess superstar. He came second overall in the competition.

Describing Praggnanandhaa's win as ""extremely good news,"" his coach RB Ramesh told CNN: ""He is very cool about his performance. He loves the game a lot. He's very passionate about it and very ambitious.""

190,190,2018-06-21 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Most of the time when you hear me talking about food, I am talking about the food we eat. But a few years ago, I realized I needed to talk more about the food we DON'T eat.

Far too often, food is thrown in the trash and dumped in landfills instead of filling hungry bellies. You have probably heard the statistics: Nearly 40% of our food goes to waste in the United States -- either in the fields, on the docks, in grocery stores or in people's homes. That's 165 billion pounds of food every year. It is an astonishing number and one that sadly reflects both the extravagance and the waste seen in one of the richest countries in the world.

I promise you that our children and grandchildren will rightly hold us accountable for this tragic misuse of food that has led to a plundering of our land, an accumulation of greenhouse gases and the loss of precious water used to grow and produce that wasted food.

What boggled my mind, though, is the unacceptable disconnect between food waste and hunger. How is it possible that we trash this ridiculous amount of food while one in six children (one in eight people of all ages) in the United States is food-insecure , unsure when or if they will receive another meal? This is why I chose to focus on the charity Feeding America for CNN's Champions for Change series.

I didn't get into journalism to become an advocate for anything. In fact, the more I learn, the more I realize I still don't know. So it is not my nature to be so certain that I become dogmatic and categorically convinced that I am right. Yet after 17 years of traveling the world reporting on both natural and manmade disasters, this particular issue has haunted me more than most. And I now know it is one we can absolutely solve.

The most emotional story I have ever covered

Witnessing mass hunger and starvation during the 2011 famine in Somalia was the most emotional story I have ever covered. To this day, to speak about it, my chest tightens, my eyes redden, and I can't hold back the tears. It gets to me because it was senseless and so unceasingly brutal to watch. Also, I hate to feel helpless, which has gotten me into trouble at times as I dive headfirst into situations wanting to do something, anything, to try to help. During that famine, the UN estimates that more than a quarter of a million people died for lack of food, and there was nothing meaningful I could do about it.

What is happening in the United States is not a famine by any means, but it is a lot worse than people tend to realize. Despite gains in employment and economic growth, many people you probably know have never really recovered after the recent recession. They are your friends, neighbors and colleagues, and a significant percentage of them are staring down empty cupboards and refrigerators.

I recently spent time with a woman named Charity Mills in Colorado Springs and saw just how much the face of hunger has changed in America. Charity is educated, eloquent and employed. She also waits in a food bank line most days of the week just to feed her family. Charity described her situation to me as ""the tyranny of the moment."" At the time, I wasn't entirely sure what she meant, but I was reminded of artist Willem de Kooning, who once said, ""being poor takes up all your time."" It's true. Today, 41 million Americans aren't sure where their next meal is coming from , and for them, it is all they can think about.

JUST WATCHED Why rule breakers, rule Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why rule breakers, rule 01:19

In the past, Charity and her family qualified for food stamps, now known as SNAP , the supplemental nutrition assistance program. They used to get $963 a month for a family of seven, which is about $4.58 a day per person. But nowadays, Charity and millions of other Americans find themselves in an unforgiving middle ground, not benefiting from the recent improvements in the economy but having their benefits slashed nonetheless. With her husband back in school and Charity back at work, her family is still food-insecure but no longer able to qualify for food stamps. The reality: They are now dependent on the generosity of others to eat.

How we can fix this problem

Luckily, Americans are among the most generous people on Earth . As a result, organizations like Feeding America are able to create a web of 200 food banks across the country and help make sure more than 40 million Americans like Charity have a good shot at securing their next meal. Formerly called Second Harvest, Feeding America works under the philosophy that America already has enough food to feed everyone if we can just connect the food that is being wasted with the people who so desperately need it.

As with most things, this is trickier than it appears. First off, for big businesses to simply donate food, they have to spend money. They have to package it, ship it and store it or refrigerate it properly. Without organizations like Feeding America, it is often easier and cheaper for companies to throw out the extra food. Second, many organizations worry about the legal risks of donating food, even though they shouldn't. The Good Samaritan Food Donation Act protects good-faith food donors from liability if the recipient should become ill.

Finally, most of us consumers often trash our food much earlier than we should because of somewhat arbitrary ""use by"" and ""sell by"" dates . These dates aren't even required by federal law , except for infant formula, and have nothing to do with safety of the food. You can eat your eggs more than a month after purchase, even though the ""use by"" date is much earlier. Unless your produce is clearly spoiled, it is still fine to consume. The expiration dates in this case are more an indication of freshness. And even I was surprised to learn that canned meat can last five years past the date stamped on the container.

It is time for all of us to start thinking more about the food we don't eat, because when it comes to hunger and food insecurity, we all have a role to play. We don't need to be so picky when it comes to our food. Resolve to eat uglier but perfectly edible fruit. At the grocery store, buy only what you need instead of what you want, and don't worry so much about the dates stamped on your food.

And when you think of throwing food in the trash, remember Charity Mills and the tyranny of her moment. I am not asking you to turn your world upside-down or even to make tough sacrifices. Simply cut down your food waste, and I am convinced we can successfully feed Charity and the rest of America.","Dr. Gupta: After all my years of reporting, this still haunts me",http://cnn.com/2018/06/21/health/fighting-hunger-in-america-sanjay-gupta-cfc/index.html
191,191,2018-06-20 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) On World Refugee Day, 25.4 million people find themselves forcibly displaced and living in another country, more than double the population of Belgium.

Countries around the world, not least the United States, are grappling with what is becoming the norm: an increasing number of people fleeing their homes because of conflict, persecution, poverty or climate change.

In Europe, almost three years on from what became known as the refugee crisis, tens of thousands are stranded in camps, living hand to mouth on the streets of cities or under the constant threat of deportation.

In many cases volunteers have stepped in to fill the gaps left by states. CNN spoke to seven people across Europe, some of whom have given up partners, children and a stable life to support refugees, and to some of those they've helped.

The interviews have been edited for length and clarity.

'We were getting endless death threats'

Philippa Kempson has lived on the Greek island of Lesbos with her husband, Eric, and daughter Elleni since 2000. In early 2015, they began helping migrants and refugees arriving on the island's shores -- and haven't stopped since.

It was impossible not to be involved. When you're driving your child to school and you see children on the beach, you have to stop. There's always been refugees on the island, but first we thought, maybe we're not allowed to help, but when it started to become women and children, you couldn't go past them, you couldn't not stop. We were on our own doing this for months

We were having deaths nearly every day; there were people who had drowned and washed up on the beach, people with hypothermia. On October 28, 2015, we lost a boat with over 300 people on it. Only 242 were recovered alive. That morning we'd already lost two children -- they had come in with hypothermia and died on the shore.

Now we're getting more children arriving on the boats. Young boys, 14 or 15, are being sent on their own from Turkey. The parents don't want them to get caught up in conflict so they're sending the kids on their own.

The hotspot camp of Moria is made up of children these days... The official capacity is 3,000, but there are close to 8,000 people in this camp.

The treatment of people is out-and-out deliberate to stop people from coming. Well, it's not working out... People are dying daily. We've got children dying in Europe because we don't want to help people fleeing war -- it makes no sense to me.

We had to send my daughter away (to the UK) at the end of 2015 because we were getting endless threats, death threats, some from the local community, some from further afield... People are convinced that if we weren't here to help, the refugees wouldn't come.

My daughter was 17 by then and it was impossible to keep her safe. Sending her away is the hardest thing we've ever done. We came to Greece for a quiet life and to be able to be a family... Now we live with locked gates and cameras.

A refugee child plays alone at the Moria refugee camp on May 20, 2018, in Mytilene, Greece.

Sayed, 18, from Afghanistan, arrived in Lesbos 11 months ago and now helps out at a warehouse run by Kempson distributing clothes and hygiene products to other refugees. He's waiting for news on his asylum claim.

When I came, I thought, maybe I can find my future. Now I don't think so. I have Philippa but I have nothing else.

You cannot relax your mind for one night. I worry all the time. My mind is so bad; I think I need a doctor for my mind.

I want to leave here because it's not good for me... Maybe some people are kind but they treat us all the same. I am not a killer, I am not bad, I don't want anything from these people.

If I could leave, I wouldn't stay here for one more minute.

'It felt like I died inside'

Anders Boklund runs several refugee homes for unaccompanied minors in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden. He used to be a social worker before starting to manage refugee homes in 2010.

The initial years of the refugee crisis, 2014-15, gave me hope. We were going in the right direction. We were taking responsibility.

But now, the way politics has gone, I am becoming more cynical. We went from everyone saying that this was an important issue -- the Swedish Prime Minister saying we all had to open our hearts -- to now, where you can't even say in politics that you are pro-migration because that means political suicide. Now it's a competition of who can present the harshest immigration policies.

It's sad. Nothing good will come out of this. It's turning into a competition. Everyone was afraid of the right-wing populists. Now, their policies are the ones that Social Democrats and other parties are in favor of.

Most of the (child refugees) are getting negative decisions. Most of them cannot prove that they are under 18, so they are getting tried as adults.

When they are 18 they leave our care, and they are the responsibility of the migration board. But none of them want to live with the migration services, so they turn out homeless, with drug problems, social unrest between the groups; what you can expect really, given what they've endured. And that is used by the populists.

This downward spiral has to stop... If we continue like this -- with no one wanting to take responsibility -- it is going to be a tremendous tragedy.

People in Stockholm show their solidarity with migrants in a rally in September 2015. Many people's attitudes in the country have since changed.

Barat left Pakistan for Sweden in 2015 when he was 16. After waiting three years for a final decision on his asylum claim, he was deported to Afghanistan and now works as a fruit seller back in his home city of Quetta, Pakistan.

I was extremely happy and full of hope (when I came to Sweden). I hoped for a better future without war.

I believed that (the Swedish authorities) would help us after listening to my life story and all of my problems. They just wanted to show that they were nice. They wanted to show the world that they were the nicest, but they weren't unfortunately.

The first rejection was the worst. It felt like I died inside; all my feelings, all my hope died. I started to cut myself. I became completely sick both physically and mentally.

(When I was deported to Afghanistan) It felt like I was going back to hell where I would be killed by terrorists.

I am scared still as I take huge risks just going to town and to work. I don't know when I might be killed in an explosion or an attack... What plans can you have in a country where death waits for you everywhere?

Barat now lives in Quetta, Pakistan, where he is fearful of attacks. On May 27, a shootout in the city left two officers and two militants dead.

'People are losing heart'

Cecelia Bittner, comes from New York but has volunteered with Refugee Community Kitchen since early 2016, serving hot meals to migrants and refugees in Calais and Paris, France.

I came (to Calais) just for two weeks in February 2016... and I'm still here. I had fallen in love with a cheese farmer in West Wales and I was living there. Then my British visa lapsed and I was waiting for a new one.

(After two weeks in Calais) I called the Welsh farmer and I said, I'm not coming back.

The Calais ""Jungle"" was a unique place. (The camp was cleared by authorities in October 2016.) It's like a festival in horrible conditions, but with the same sense of solidarity. My job was to go door to door around the tents and ask how many people needed food. People just kept inviting me in and feeding me tea. People just tried to give back whenever they could.

I saw grown men completely terrified, shuttled around, completely powerless with no idea what's going to happen to them.

They've (the authorities) always had this idea that if they make it horrible enough, people will leave. But a lot of these people have been through infinitely worse conditions. They've watched tons of people die around them across the Sahara, across the ocean.

It's wearing on people. We've had multiple suicide attempts at aid distribution points recently. People are losing heart.

People are dying all the time on the borders throughout Europe... Our response right now is telling and will be remembered. Trump and the French state, (President Emmanuel) Macron, they're on the wrong side of history; people will look back on this the same way as they look back on World War II and they will be horrified.

French anti-riot police officers arrive in October 2016 to clear the Calais ""Jungle"".

'People in distress are political game'

Ruben Neugebauer is one of the founders of Sea-Watch , a search-and-rescue organization working in the Mediterranean since 2015.

I had good luck to be born in Germany, in one of the richest countries in the world... I was born in 1989, when the Berlin Wall was breaking away, and raised in a time when the border was open.

One particular moment struck me. It was in July 2015, we were on the rescue boat Sea-Watch 2, and there were more than 1,000 people in distress. One girl, a 16-year-old, died after being rescued. Not by drowning, she died of exhaustion... We tried to reanimate her and we failed.

After she died, we were on the deck, sitting there, some of us crying. We were flying the ship's flag at half-mast, the only thing you can do in that moment.

When we started, there were people saying ""we cannot let people die"" and organizations like ours were praised for saving lives. Now, with populists on the rise in Europe, everything has changed. Right now, people in distress are political game for them in a way that it wouldn't have been possible three years ago. They're gambling with human life, and Europe doesn't take responsibility.

'A deep and solid bond'

Bernadette Koopmann has been mentoring the Mohammadi family since their arrival in the German town of Altena in 2015. Her role as mentor evolved into a bond of friendship -- she was with them when their youngest daughter was born and cried with them on learning that their refugee status was rejected last year.

The experience has enriched my life. When I gave the language course, I caught myself thinking, I can't do it, I'm too busy... but I always had and still feel a sense of joy when helping them. They left their war torn country and came here. I feel at peace when I offer my help to them.

One difficulty is to manage all our emotions... The administrative courts are overwhelmed in Germany with the complaints of asylum rejections -- the rejection status of my family and the subsequent appeal has not changed since 2017. They are still waiting. That makes the family depressed and it is difficult for me as well. For them it is the battle of daily uncertainty: Are we going to be deported?

There are reports on television showing deportations... They ask: do we need to leave again? That makes me sad too. I have built a deep and solid bond with this family.

At their home in Altena, Yalda, 8 and Omit, 8, play together with 9-month-old Elena, all members of the Mohammadi family.

'Our mission is to save lives in the mountains'

Simone Bobbio is a volunteer rescuer in the Italian Alps. Usually, he and the other volunteers rescue skiers or hikers, but since last September, more migrants have been attempting to cross through the mountains into France from Italy -- and some don't make it.

Our first migrant rescue mission took place on September 27, 2017, when a migrant was found along the paths towards France with a broken thigh bone.

Around 88% of the people we rescue every year are practicing leisure or sports activities. The rest are living or working in mountain areas. In the case of migrants we were faced with people risking their lives -- one dead body was in fact found last April when the snow melted -- while trying to escape towards France in search of better living conditions.

For us and for those we normally rescue, mountains are the environment we love, a passion that justifies the objective risks we encounter when we practice mountain activities. For the migrants they represent one of the dangerous barriers separating them from their life aspirations.

In a hostile environment like the mountains, conditions are difficult for everybody and life is fragile so everybody has the responsibility to help others because anyone could find himself in need.

No matter our political and social views, our mission is to save lives in the mountains.

'Go back to where you came from'

Nina Kaye wanted to start hosting refugees after her two adult sons moved out, leaving her and her husband, Timothy, alone. They couldn't find an organization that did that, so in 2015 they set one up themselves called Refugees at Home in Epsom outside London, England.

Perhaps I wanted to help because my own mother was a refugee from Austria. She had to travel on her own to Stockholm when she was 13 -- so I'm the product of a refugee.

We've always been aware of the plight of what's going on with refugees... and we've always thought: there but for the grace of God go any of us. They're people just like you and me.

We've encountered the hostile environment that (UK Prime Minister) Theresa May started -- and has now admitted. And I think it is getting harder (for refugees). It's like going into a brick wall with the Home Office -- there's just no response at all.

Habib, one person who stayed with us, had been put into accommodation that was beyond disgusting. He was told: if you don't like what we're offering you can go back to where you came from. It makes me so angry that people are treated this way.

(CNN) Dementia is not a subject that produces a lot of good news and even when it does there tends to be a caveat attached -- a qualifier, a ""but."" Case in point: media reports last week of a study , published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, finding that the percentage of Americans age 65-plus who suffer from dementia declined by one-and-a-half percentage points, from 12% to 10.5%, over the 12-year period studied. It was good news, to be sure.

But here's the caveat: over the same 12-year period the total number of people suffering from dementia in the United States grew, significantly, and now sits at nearly 6 million . In other words, although a slightly smaller percentage of older people are developing dementia, the skyrocketing size of the 65+ population means that, overall, there are more people with dementia -- lots more.

Looking ahead, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) projects that over the next generation or so (by 2050) the number of people suffering from dementia in the US will increase about 250% to nearly 14 million

None of which is intended to diminish the stalwart work of many of the brightest minds in medical science, who, collectively, have endeavored for more than 30 years to find ways to treat dementia. But progress has been painfully slow. Despite decades of research and billions of dollars spent, dementia remains not just incurable but largely untreatable. There's not even a widely available screening tool for diagnosing the disease.

Digging deeper, it's been more than 15 years since a new dementia drug, Namenda , was approved for use in the US and it's one that brings only partial and temporary relief of symptoms of the disease while doing nothing to halt its progress. Since that drug's introduction, more than 400 clinical trials for new dementia-focused drugs have failed.

Once-promising research focusing on eliminating brain plaques thought to cause dementia have, unfortunately, not produced effective treatments. With so much effort, yet such modest progress, it's no surprise that many drug companies have scaled back , if not altogether abandoned, their research programs into new drugs to fight dementia.

Reason for hope

invested in 17 companies and projects focused on dementia drug discovery with the goal of developing disease-modifying treatments for a range of different forms of dementia. However, with stakes as high as those posed by dementia, hope springs eternal. An important example can be found in the work of the Dementia Discovery Fund (DDF), a venture fund focused solely on discovering and developing effective new drugs for treating dementia. Comprised of an influential group of strategic investors, including Bill Gates , DDF hasinvested in 17 companies and projects focused on dementia drug discovery with the goal of developing disease-modifying treatments for a range of different forms of dementia.

This week AARP will announce that it is investing $60 million in DDF's work, in addition to securing participation from UnitedHealth Group and Quest Diagnostics, which have invested $10 million and $5 million respectively, totaling $75 million, to the DDF's fight against a disease that has not seen a new approved treatment in more than a decade.

DDF has an active program of identifying new companies developing drugs to treat dementia. It is also creating and funding new projects that can develop into biotech companies in areas of strong scientific interest where none currently exist. DDF's goal: by 2025, developing three to five new drugs that can aid people with dementia.

It will take years

But let's not get carried away: DDF's work will play out over years. And, even then, there's no ""guarantee"" of success -- only that stones are being turned over, possibilities pursued, new paths forged. Meanwhile, dementia's scourge continues, largely unabated -- and it's not just those diagnosed with the disease who suffer.

Studies show that in the US alone more than 16 million unpaid family caregivers spend more than $230 billion a year providing 18 billion unpaid hours of support to relatives (mostly aging parents and grandparents) suffering from dementia. That's more than 20 hours per week, every week -- on top of working a job.

If you're untouched by the realities of caregiving so far, hopefully your good fortune will continue, but as the statistics from CDC and others show, the odds grow worse each year. That's why lawmakers, the private sector and other stakeholders need to, in their own ways, join the fight against dementia, not just in terms of drug development, but on other fronts as well.

One example is the Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage (RAISE) Family Caregivers Act , newly signed into law, with following bipartisan support, which requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to bring representatives from the private and public sectors; caregivers, employers and others together to find establish a plan to support unpaid family caregivers.

Of course, even the best plans don't always pan out, and you never get anywhere without trying.

(CNN) The cover of the last issue of the leading German news magazine, Der Spiegel, was a vivid illustration, indicative of one view of Donald Trump that seems to be growing. It showed a beaming Trump surrounded by Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, Xi Jinping and Recep Tayyip Erdogan with the headline ""Ich bin das volk,"" followed by, ""Das zeitalter der autokratenz"" -- ""I am the people: The age of the autocrats.""

On Sunday, the Turkish people, in a nationwide snap election that saw an unprecedented 87% turnout , apparently have given their autocratic President another unprecedented mandate, though final returns won't be available for some days. Voters had already granted the President more power in a referendum just over a year ago.

These two trips to the polls by Turkish voters confirmed that security and a thriving economy, despite some recent weakness, trump most traditional democratic values. Many nations are beginning to shrug off their longstanding democratic exteriors

Globally, however, the drift toward strong leaders able to assure prosperity and security is a most dangerous challenge to American principles that have prevailed since the framing of our constitution more than two centuries ago.

In the United States, Trump's attitude toward displaced refugee children -- arguably the greatest and most toxic challenge yet to its hold on power -- is the most immediate and vivid evidence that our leader does not champion any sort of effort for America to remain a shining beacon for nations aspiring to maintain or establish a democratic system of government.

Many fear that Donald Trump is leading America, and by extension large swaths of the world, toward a post-democratic system that no longer recognizes any form of traditional constitutional government.

""The appeal and superiority of constitutional democracy cannot be taken for granted,"" I was told by Professor David Law of Washington University in St. Louis and The University of Hong Kong. ""Many fear that constitutional democracy is under threat from democratic backlash and losing ground to illiberal constitutionalism.""

Vastly larger stretches of the world are more concerned about basics of food, housing and personal safety. For them, worrying about democracy takes a back seat to securing the necessities that will help them survive.

The acceptance of authoritarian leaders would appear to be a central element that has set Donald Trump at odds with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and indeed most of the other members of the G-7. Trump's desire to see the G-7 restore to its ranks Putin and Russia, expelled after the invasion and seizure of Crimea, as well as his praise for Kim, is a suggestion that perhaps Trump feels more comfortable with world leaders who rule without any tolerance of opposition and with the ability to impose their will and vision on their nation.

The latest crisis over the separation of immigrant children from their parents demonstrates that Trump is growing more prepared to govern effectively by fiat. Much of the rest of the government appears willing to allow him to do that, or at least unable or unwilling to prevent him from doing so -- although in some cases, such as the travel ban, Obamacare repeal, and the Russia investigation, countervailing forces in the US government have constrained Trump.

Constitutional scholars do point out that this is not a new trend, dating back at least to the presidency of Richard Nixon. Henry Kissinger was revealed in a cable released by WikiLeaks to have said in 1975 that ""the illegal we do immediately, the unconstitutional takes a little longer,"" which even the Kremlin-linked website RT was delighted to cite

But Trump has developed into an art form this ability to skirt the Constitution and especially its institutionalization of checks and balances, sweeping away decades of legislative and administrative change with all but total impunity.

David Law and research partner Mila Versteeg of the University of Virginia Law School concluded some time ago that the American Constitution is no longer the model for most nations seeking to write a new document for themselves. Instead, many have looked to the Canadian constitution, with its respect for basic human rights and human values and a social and political system that more closely represents a vision of the world that they would like to see their government embrace.

However, in an interview, Versteeg confessed to me that she has more recently come to believe instead that ""there may not be one perfect constitution, but what matters is whether citizens are willing to defend it. The brand of American constitutionalism took a big blow with Donald Trump. It's kind of Trump versus the Constitution.""

Versteeg has lectured frequently in Africa, particularly to young African leaders who have suggested that ""economic growth, efficiency, asserting oneself in the world, being a global power, being an economic power are all more important than democracy."" At the University of Lesotho, one young leader raised his hand and observed, ""You go around the world and tell us about democracy. So how is it that the candidate with 3 million fewer votes won the presidency? How is that democracy?""

""The American brand is more in decline than ever,"" Versteeg told me.

Is there a solution?

Some have suggested that a new constitutional convention is essential. It would take 34 state legislatures to agree to such a procedure. So far, we are barely a third of the way toward such a sweeping move. While this may appear on the surface to have some real merit, possibly replacing the electoral college, for instance, the entire process could be quite disastrous.

""How do you design a constitutional drafting process?"" Versteeg asked. ""Who gets to do the drafting, who gets to be involved? If you don't have a James Madison and a Thomas Jefferson, who gets to do this job?""

There has been a wave of moves toward constitutional redraftings abroad recently, or efforts to dramatically circumvent existing documents, especially in Central Europe . None has turned out very well, at least for the preservation of democratic norms. All such documents do have a bill of rights, which is effectively meaningless with a strong president and few checks and balances. In Turkey's case, the recent constitutional redrafting has given the President all but unchecked powers.

Any effort to rebalance some of the traditional provisions of the United States Constitution would likely run afoul of many of the same forces that have given Trump too much leeway in his words and actions. It would also give many abroad reason to pause when it comes to embracing the American model or democracy.

For as Versteeg observed, ""Whoever controls the political landscape controls the constitutional convention.""

Keating is a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan and author of ""Born Anxious: The Lifelong Impact of Early Life Adversity -- and How to Break the Cycle,"" published in 2017 by St. Martin's Press. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) The Trump administration's family separation policy, which separated asylum-seeking parents from their children at the US border, may have just been stopped with the President's executive order, but it doesn't erase the psychological impact and biological damage that these migrants have already endured. If the new approach fails to pass legal scrutiny, a real possibility, such separations could resume.

Daniel Keating

These children did not get to the border on their own. They are entirely innocent by any standard. But the trauma of forced separation from one's loving family and its lifelong consequences are hard to overstate. The biological impacts are scientifically irrefutable. Toxic stress and trauma quite literally ""get under the skin."" They alter brain circuitry and functioning, as well as the way that genes work, through a process known as ""epigenetic methylation"" that can turn genes on and off. Researchers have only begun to document the many ways that these changes to gene function can wreak havoc on the developing child, including even fetuses. But what we already know is striking.

We now know that both brains and genes ""listen"" to their social environment, and the message of this policy's enactment is clear. The world is dangerous and won't support you. The core impacts of trauma and toxic stress include the disruption of their stress system, leading to lifelong behavioral problems, cognitive difficulties, chronic inflammation, impaired health, and even early death. Their attachment system will also be damaged, leading to persistent difficulties in making and sustaining successful relationships.

In brief, toxic stress and trauma inflict long-lasting physical and mental damage. When parent-child separations are legally required in other contexts, such as demonstrated or suspected abuse or neglect, extreme provisions are required to balance the harm versus the necessity of removal, typically including legal representatives and court-appointed guardians for the child. No such provisions are even contemplated for these brutal, policy-driven, involuntary family separations at the border.",Why separating kids from parents is a form of torture,http://cnn.com/2018/06/21/opinions/separating-children-at-border-is-torture-opinion-keating/index.html
197,197,2018-06-24 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Suicide affects people from all walks of life, sometimes in silence and isolation. It can reach across social, political and economic lines.

That was the message Sunday on ""Finding Hope,"" a CNN special report hosted by Anderson Cooper that featured a panel of guests and audience members affected by suicide.

The recent deaths of CNN celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and fashion designer Kate Spade are the latest reminder that suicide is a complex and growing crisis in the United States, where such deaths have gone up over 25% in the past two decades.

""I lost my brother Carter to it. Glenn Close nearly lost her sister, Jessie. She got treatment, and both are here with us tonight,"" Cooper said. ""So is David Axelrod, whose father died by suicide, and Karl Rove, whose mother did. And Zak Williams, who lost his father, actor and comedian Robin Williams.""

Axelrod is a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama while Rove served in the same role in President George W. Bush's administration.

""In one way or another, everyone here tonight in this audience and with me on stage has been touched by suicide, myself included,"" Cooper said.

Words matter

Actress Glenn Close described the jarring moment her sister, Jessie Close, opened up about having suicidal thoughts.

""She said, 'I need help. I can't stop thinking about killing myself.' And I was taken aback,"" Close said.

Close offered to help her and did, but said when she looks back, she realizes she never followed up to see if more support was needed.

While it's important to offer our help to someone having suicidal thoughts, it's also important to constantly check in and ask how they are doing, said the actress.

And it can't be a one-time conversation, even if they say they're OK, Glenn Close said.

Zak Williams reiterated that it's crucial to reach out to people who are struggling and love them unconditionally.

Jessie Close said when she asked her sister for help, a voice in her head was repeatedly saying, ""Kill yourself, kill yourself."" She urged those having suicidal thoughts that it's their responsibility to ask for help.

'My actions were different'

Former Navy SEAL Jimmy Hatch said his military friends saved him when he no longer wanted to live.

Hatch felt lost after an injury in Afghanistan ended his military career, and was going though a ""transitional period,"" he said. His military friends intervened when his wife ran out of options, and took him to a mental hospital.

""I wasn't really crying out. My words were great, but my actions were different. And those guys who had been near me in gunfights and things like that, spent a lot of time with me in the past, they realized that in spite of my words, I was not well,"" he said. ""And they came and injected themselves into my life.""

Loved ones question why

Axelrod was in college when he heard that his father had killed himself. His father was a psychologist who'd helped countless of other people with suicidal thoughts.

Asking for help The suicide rate in the United States has seen sharp increases in recent years. Studies have shown that the risk of suicide declines sharply when people call the national suicide hotline: 1-800-273-TALK. There is also a crisis text line. For crisis support in Spanish, call 1-888-628-9454. The lines are staffed by a mix of paid professionals and unpaid volunteers trained in crisis and suicide intervention. The confidential environment, the 24-hour accessibility, a caller's ability to hang up at any time and the person-centered care have helped its success, advocates say.



The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.

""It was so heartbreaking to think that he could do that for others, but he didn't -- he couldn't -- reach out for himself. And I ask myself all the time, 'Why?'"" he said.

Dr. Christine Moutier, chief medical officer for American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, said it's normal for survivors to ask questions about what signs they missed or what they could have done.

Rove, whose mother died by suicide, wondered if there was anything he could have done to stop her death. At the time, his mother was going through a dark period, but she sounded like she was getting better, he said.

When it comes to suicide of a loved one, it's easy to get stuck on how their life ended, instead of how they lived, Cooper said.

""My brother died by suicide nearly 30 years ago, and still not a day goes by when I do not find myself thinking about what happened and asking, ""why?"" he said.

'It's an illness'

Having suicidal thoughts should not be considered a stigma. It's an illness that a doctor can fix if caught on time, Axelrod said.

""For 30 years after my father's death, I never talked about it ... I didn't talk about it because I was impacted by the sense of stigma that somehow this was a blight on his character,"" he said.

The stigma goes beyond the issue of deaths by suicide.

Jane Clementi's son, Tyler, had recently come out and was a target of cyberbullying when he died by suicide in 2010.

""Gay youth are also more likely to be bullied. And of course not all bullying situations end in the terrible circumstances that Tyler's did -- but they still suffer great consequences,"" Clementi said.

Some of the bullying, she said, is a result of the stigma against gay people.

""I think if we could stop teaching that ... being gay is a sin, I believe that most of the LGBT youth suicides would decrease or maybe even disappear,"" she said.

Survivors speak out

Eleven years have passed since Jordan Burnham nearly died by suicide when he was 18.

At the time, Burnham said, he was ashamed to share with loved ones that he did not feel like himself.

""There wasn't an open culture when it comes to talking about when we're struggling and our mental health issues,"" he said.

He's seen how the conversation has slowly changed around the issue.

""There's a difference in the way students are talking about this, and being open and honest I think is incredible,"" he said.

Another survivor, Dese'Rae Stage, collects stories and portraits of suicide attempt survivors like her to help reduce the prejudice and discrimination.

""I wanted to show that we are people, we're just like everyone else, we come from different cultures, different backgrounds, social economic status, age range, gender presentation, sexual orientation,"" Stage said. ""That suicide doesn't discriminate, essentially.""",No one is immune to suicide. But there is hope,http://cnn.com/2018/06/24/health/finding-hope-suicide-anderson-cooper-special-report/index.html
198,198,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) An Arizona woman has criticized Walgreens on social media, saying a pharmacist at the chain refused to fill her prescription for a medicine prescribed to induce miscarriage after she was told her 9-week-old fetus had stopped developing.

Walgreens says it allows pharmacists to step away from filling a prescription ""for which they have a moral objection,"" but that they are required to ""refer the prescription to another pharmacist or manager on duty to meet the patient's needs in a timely manner."" The woman, Nicole Mone Arteaga, said she was later able to pick up her prescription from another Walgreens store.

""Each week I went for my ultra sound praying to see progress and hear the sound of little heartbeat. Unfortunately, development isn't happening and my body is slowly getting ready to miscarry. My (doctor) gave me two choices D & C or a prescription that will help induce bleeding and discharge in the comfort of my home,"" she wrote.

""D&C,"" also known as dilation and curettage, is a surgical procedure to remove tissue from the uterus . In the case of a fetus failing to develop, it is performed to prevent infection or heavy bleeding.

Walgreens apologizes

Walgreens said in a statement Monday that it is looking into the matter ""to ensure our patients' needs are handled properly.""

""After learning what happened, we reached out to the patient and apologized for how the situation was handled. To respect the sincerely held beliefs of our pharmacists while at the same time meeting the needs of our patients, our policy allows pharmacists to step away from filling a prescription for which they have a moral objection. At the same time, they are also required to refer the prescription to another pharmacist or manager on duty to meet the patient's needs in a timely manner,"" Walgreens said in a statement emailed to CNN.

'I left Walgreens in tears'

Arteaga said she left Walgreens in tears after a pharmacist refused to let her pick up her prescription to induce miscarriage.

""Last night I went to pick up my medication at my local Walgreens only to be denied the prescription I need. I stood at the mercy of this pharmacist explaining my situation in front of my 7 year old, and five customers standing behind only to be denied because of his ethical beliefs,"" she wrote in a Facebook post Friday.

""I get it we all have our beliefs. But what he failed to understand is this isn't the situation I had hoped for, this isn't something I wanted. This is something I have zero control over.""

In comments on CNN, Arteaga said she felt a sense of helplessness when the pharmacist said he wasn't going to fill the prescription.

""The world felt like it was closing in and I was thinking, this is my body and I'm losing control,"" she said.

""I couldn't control the fact that my body wasn't going to support this pregnancy. And I wanted this baby. I couldn't control what my body was doing and now here I am trying to make my decision and what I'm going to do, and this person was taking that away from me and making that choice for me.""

Arteaga described her miscarriage as an emotional roller coaster and said the pharmacist had ""no idea what it's like to want nothing more than to carry a child to full term and be unable to do so.""

""I left Walgreens in tears, ashamed and feeling humiliated by a man who knows nothing of my struggles but feels it is his right to deny medication prescribed to me by my doctor,"" she said.

Arteaga said she would not usually share such a story but did not want other women to have the same experience at a time ""when you are vulnerable and already suffering.""

In an update to her post, Arteaga said she later received an email notification that her prescription was ready at a different Walgreens location. She said she collected it after first revisiting her doctor to ensure he could help her fill the script.

Arteaga said she spoke to a store manager ""who did not seem happy about what had happened"" and had also contacted Walgreens corporate office.

""I have filed a complaint with the Arizona Board of Pharmacy. At this time I have done what I can to report the situation. Thank you to those who have shown love and support,"" she said.

By early Monday, her post had been shared more than 30,000 times and liked more than 55,000 times.

Walgreens policy

On Twitter, a user asked Walgreens Saturday: ""What is your policy regarding dispensing prescribed medication? (Do) your pharmacists have the right to refuse service based upon their religious beliefs? Do they work for Walgreens or for themselves?""

The chain tweeted in response: ""Our policy allows pharmacists to step away from filling a prescription for which they have a moral objection. At the same time, they are also required to refer the prescription to another pharmacist or manager on duty to meet the patient's needs in a timely manner.""

Aliou Cissé is quite possibly the coolest coach in the tournament. He is unmissable pitch-side with dreadlocks and oversize spectacles.

At 42, he's the youngest coach in the World Cup and has now been immortalized in a meme.

Cisse was the former captain of his national side and is blazing a trail for other African coaches -- crucial in a continent that tends to favor the expertise of foreign coaches over homegrown talent.

""I represent a new generation that would like to have its place in African and world football,"" he told reporters in Russia recently.

""Indeed I am the only black coach in this tournament. It's a painful reality that annoys me. I believe that football is universal. I believe that skin color has little importance in the game.""

President Macky Sall has been tweeting his support for the team and arrived in Russia ahead of Tuesday's game to cheer the team on.

He also took part in an inspirational video message encouraging 'Les Lions' and showing them that the whole country is behind them.

In the video, Sall can be heard saying: ""I am very pleased to see you on the occasion of the qualification of our national team to the World Cup. Sixteen years has been a long wait.... unity is our country. This is why my hope is that everybody unites in their support of the national team.""

200,200,2018-04-11 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan's bombshell announcement that he will not seek re-election brings with it immediate and long-term political ramifications for his southeast Wisconsin district and the House landscape overall, where Democrats need to pick up 23 seats to gain the majority in 2019.

The most acute effect will be felt in Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District, which Ryan has represented since 1999. He already was facing a potential challenge from Democrat Randy Bryce, who had raised nearly $5 million for his campaign, including $2 million in the first quarter of 2018. The district, which includes Kenosha and Ryan's hometown of Janesville, is more favorable terrain for Democrats than the southwest Pennsylvania district Conor Lamb won in the March special election.

The Republican-aligned candidate in the recent Supreme Court race in Wisconsin won this district by five percentage points, despite losing the statewide race by more than 11 points.

That GOP performance is on par with Mitt Romney's margin in the district in 2012, but less than Donald Trump's 10-point spread there in 2016.

Bryce's bid is likely to lose a little enthusiasm without Ryan's name on the ballot, but the energy this cycle is clearly on the Democratic side.

More broadly, Republicans are also losing the party's best fundraiser for House candidates. Just this Monday, Ryan's campaign announced hauling in more than $11 million in the first quarter of the year, bringing its total raised to $54 million -- and transferring more than $40 million to the National Republican Congressional Committee to help other GOP candidates this cycle.

Then there are the optics of the decision. By announcing his retirement now, it sends a dire signal to Republicans that an already tough environment could get even more challenging.

Ryan's open seat moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican, with the potential to become more competitive depending on who the GOP nominates to run in this district.

At the same time we are making a few other changes to our House race ratings.

Arizona

AZ-08: We are soon going to get yet another peek into the 2018 political landscape with an upcoming special election where Republicans are hoping the natural DNA of the district will be somewhat more resistant to the Democratic enthusiasm that toppled their candidates in Pennsylvania and Alabama.

The April 24 contest in Arizona's 8th Congressional District features Republican Debbie Lesko, a former state senator, and Democrat Hiral Tipirneni, an emergency room physician. The seat was vacated in December when GOP Rep. Trent Franks resigned amid sexual harassment allegations.

Democrats did not contest this House seat in 2016 or 2014.

At the presidential level, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by 21 points in the district, which is made up primarily of the western Phoenix suburbs and chock full of retirees. Romney bested Barack Obama there by 25 points in 2012.

On the heels of Lamb's victory last month, Republicans aren't taking any chances. They've poured more than $600,000 into the race to keep it from flipping to the Democrats.

Democrats aren't nearly as bullish on this special election as they were about Pennsylvania. Republicans hold a 17-point advantage in voter registration in the district. Lesko remains a heavy favorite, but given how Democrats have overperformed in special elections the past year, this race should be closer than most would normally expect.

This race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

Ohio

OH-12: After the Arizona special election, all eyes will turn to this central Ohio district, which became open when Republican Pat Tiberi resigned in January to lead the Ohio Business Roundtable. The district is more urban than PA-18, which should make it a bit bluer. The inner ring Columbus suburbs are the kinds of places where Democrats expect to make gains this cycle. It's slightly less white than PA-18, and also a bit younger and with more college graduates. Trump got 52% of the vote here in 2012, underperforming Romney's 54% mark. There are crowded primaries on both sides, but the makeup of the district and the Democratic edge in enthusiasm mean this one is likely to get more competitive before August. This race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

Florida

FL-15: Ryan's isn't the only retirement announcement from Republicans Wednesday. Four-term Rep. Dennis Ross is leaving as well, opening up a seat in a district that includes the Tampa Suburbs -- and has the same partisan tilt on the presidential level as Ryan's district. There is a crowded Democratic primary there, with 31-year-old Navy veteran Andrew Learned holding a slight fundraising edge at this point. With Ross no longer on the ballot, this seat appears primed to become more competitive. This race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

New York

NY-11: Max Rose, a former non-profit healthcare executive and Army veteran, gives Democrats a candidate who could make inroads in this district, home to Staten Island. Rose also stands to benefit from a fractured Republican primary, with incumbent Rep. Dan Donovan running against former Rep. Michael Grimm, who served time in prison for felony tax fraud. For his part, Donovan is facing allegations he used his position to intervene in the arrest of his domestic partner's son on charges of heroin possession. This race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

Ohio

OH-14: Democrat Betsy Rader doesn't have a primary, giving her a clear shot at challenging GOP Rep. Dave Joyce in the 14th, home to the Cleveland and Akron suburbs. Like OH-12, this district has been more favorable to Democrats in previous elections than PA-18. Trump won it by 11 points in 2016, but Romney carried it by only three points in 2012. This race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

Wisconsin

WI-07: GOP Rep. Sean Duffy looks well-positioned to win re-election in northern Wisconsin, with more than $2 million in the bank at last check. But the recent state Supreme Court election in the Badger State suggests it might not be a sure thing, with a 20-point swing in favor of the Democrats from Trump's margin in 2016. Democrats think Bon Iver manager Kyle Frenette could give them a shot here. Frenette recently announced raising $250,000 in the six weeks since his campaign launched.

202,202,2018-02-27 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) They're not slumped over in alleyways with used needles by their sides. Their dignity, at least from outside appearances, remains intact. They haven't lost everything while chasing an insatiable high.

They are functioning heroin addicts -- people who hold down jobs, pay the bills and fool their families.

For some, addiction is genetic; they're wired this way. For others, chronic pain and lack of legal opioids landed them here. Or experimentation got them hooked and changed everything.

What addicts have in common, according to experts, is a disease that has more to do with their brains than the substances they use. About 85% of people can take a pain pill, for example, and never crave it again.

This is a story about the others, those traveling the dangerous road of functional addiction. What works for them now, experts explain, can easily and lethally be derailed.

Hanging in the balance are people you may never imagine: peers, co-workers and neighbors. Loved ones, bosses and teachers. Respected members of your community who, for the benefit of everyone's understanding, want to be heard.

After CNN gave voice last fall to addicts on skid row , the sorts we think of when we picture ""heroin addict,"" I set out to tell this overlooked part of the heroin story.

Being a functioning addict hinges on heroin use staying hush-hush, so we agreed to change the names of those willing to open up.

'All smiles and happiness at work'

Loving and successful parents, good schools, a great upbringing in the Midwest: Todd can't point to anything that drove him to drugs. He was a typical suburban high school student who dabbled in weed. Then, at 15, he popped a Percocet his mother left lying around while she was recovering from surgery.

""The feeling in my head was, 'I want to feel like this for the rest of my life,' "" Todd says. ""It was the perfect drug for me.""

The 11 years since have been a dance with opioid addiction, even as he graduated from college and embarked on a successful career in corporate management. Now 26, he has gone stretches where he's been sober, but the pull is strong and keeps yanking him back.

He's done heroin for periods of time and says it's ""fantastic,"" but shooting up isn't his style. His preference, assuming he can find them, is to buy more expensive opioids. For a long time, OxyContin was his drug of choice; now he prefers Opana and, if he can't get that, Subutex.

He makes good money, which means he can afford his $350- to $600-a-week habit.

He's figured out how much to take so he doesn't feel the pains of withdrawal, which is now his goal -- rather than getting a full-on high. His sweet spot: 60 milligrams of Opana.

""I don't know how to describe withdrawal. It's like the worst flu you've ever had in your life -- and then multiply that by 1,000,"" he says. ""There's a scraping inside your brain. You're willing to do anything to feel better.""

To avoid that hell, Todd often lives a lie. He's ""all smiles and happiness at work,"" he says, and he spins tales to guard his secret. He might say he's in one city when he's really in another. That quick trip he says he's taking to McDonald's could be to meet his dealer at Burger King. When he's used heroin, he's explained the bruises on his arm by telling people he has diabetes or an infectious disease. He once told a pharmacist he was a science teacher in need of syringes for experiments. He's invented the deaths of family members to get days off.

But death is very much a reality in his life.

His last serious girlfriend also used drugs and died from an overdose. Over the past six years, he's lost seven people he cares about to addiction.

He'd like to find love, build a relationship and have a family but says, ""It would be dishonest, and I never want to hurt anybody. That's the biggest problem.""

He knows that he has a lot to live for, but he often forgets that and struggles to imagine a future. And because he can't stray far from his dealer, a dream he does have remains on hold indefinitely.

""I've always wanted to see the world,"" he says. ""I've never been outside the country because I can't leave. I'm f***ing chained where I'm at. It's a f***ing prison.""

The sign of an addict

The sensation Todd had the first time he popped a Percocet, that feeling he wanted to hold onto for the rest of his life, was the giveaway. He, like 10% or 15% of people, has the disease of addiction, explains Dr. Stuart Gitlow, past president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine

What offers no special high for most people or may even make them feel queasy became Todd's aspiration. And part of the problem, says Gitlow, is that ""you don't know in advance what person you're going to be.""

Todd may be functioning now, but Gitlow warns that tolerances and doses often change. As an addictive disease progresses, it is also influenced by life events and stressors. What happens if Todd loses his job someday or can't afford his preferred pills?

""They all start out functioning,"" he says. ""The bulk of people taking heroin are probably functioning. It's only in the end stage that they're nodding off in an alley and have a pretty good shot of dying.""

What Todd needs, Gitlow says, is help from a doctor who is certified in addiction medicine and can treat his disease. The vast majority, or 80%, of those who seek appropriate treatment and adhere to their treatment recommendations do well, he says.

Not a unique story

It didn't start with a pill for Lisa. Her first addiction took hold at 12, when she began cutting herself.

Carving into her flesh released dopamine in her brain, giving her a high, she says. The first time she did it, she never anticipated a rush. She was overwhelmed emotionally and simply acting out. But cutting became her way to self-medicate because it offered her solace, easing the emotional pain of living in a household full of screaming.

Now, at 23, Lisa opts for heroin. And because of it and other opioids she's used, ""I hurt myself a lot less.""

The difference now is that she, like Todd, no longer seeks a high. When she shoots up each morning, she insists, ""I just do enough to stay well"" through the day and not feel physical pain.

She works hard, always has. She excelled in her college-prep private school, where she was dubbed ""gifted and talented,"" she says. She takes her job as a store manager seriously and enjoys a supportive marriage. No one at work knows that her day begins with a call to her dealer. If she has track marks, a simple long-sleeved shirt hides the evidence.

How she found heroin, she says, is not unique.

Long plagued by tendonitis in her knees and two herniated discs in her back, Lisa tried everything. Steroid injections gave her migraines, and her stomach couldn't handle anti-inflammatories. Physical and aquatic therapies offered little relief, as did deep-tissue massage. Finally, four years ago, a physician wrote out a prescription for pain pills.

She found comfort in those legal opioids. But then came the crackdown on opioid prescriptions, she says, effectively ending her lawful pain management.

Once her pills ran out, she turned to buying them on the street. They were hard to find, though, and the cost became prohibitive. An old friend, a heroin user, suggested that she give his drug a try.

""I can't find pills, I'm in pain, and it's really cheap,"" she remembers telling herself. ""What happened to me is what happened to thousands and thousands of people.""

Where she lives in Texas, near the Mexican border, the price of heroin can't be beat. One pill might cost her $50, but she can get half a gram of heroin, which is far more potent, for $20. The same product, she says, would cost up to five times as much in other parts of the country.

""If I moved somewhere where it was $100,"" she says, ""I'd quit.""

Her husband doesn't do drugs. He barely drinks. And although he'd prefer she kick the habit altogether, he's committed to being by her side -- so much that he keeps Narcan, the overdose antidote drug, in their home and has watched training videos to learn how to administer it in case she overdoses.

""He loves me enough that he's willing to stay with me,"" Lisa says. ""That's a key component to keeping me from going off the deep end.""

Lisa says a small handful of friends know that she uses heroin. Everyone else, her family included, believes she's hooked on ""just pills."" It's easier that way. Pills and other vices don't come with the same sort of judgment.

""People drink, and we think nothing of it. You do heroin, and you're the scum of the earth,"" she says. ""People will cut you out of their lives.""

Everybody's problem

Heroin users weren't always ""the scum of the earth."" In the late 19th century, it was a trademark name for an over-the-counter drug made by Bayer.

Today, there are politics behind which drugs are demonized and which aren't, and much of that is rooted in racism, says Dr. Michael Miller, who preceded Gitlow as president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine.

White socialites snorting cocaine in an Aspen ski lodge are forgiven, while inner-city blacks smoking crack -- just another form of cocaine -- are vilified and locked away, Miller explains. Heroin was romanticized when musicians used it, he says, but after black kids in coastal cities got hold of it, the perception changed and stuck.

Now, with the explosion of the opioid epidemic and the emergence of heroin as a less expensive alternative, it's become everybody's problem -- white or black, rich or poor, on the coasts or in middle America, no matter whether you live in a city, suburb or rural community.

That's how Lisa got roped in and learned to keep a secret.

She admits that the management of her addiction hinges in large part on her husband being by her side. But what if he leaves? What if life tosses her another kind of doozy? How much heroin would she need to ease her pain then?

""She has no coping skills. She's right at the edge,"" Gitlow says. ""What if her dealer gets arrested and her new dealer mixes in fentanyl? Boom. She's dead.""

'Like downing a beer'

Not everyone I spoke to considers themselves addicts. Enter Matthew.

For as long as Matthew can remember, he's battled anxiety and depression. Beyond prescriptions like Xanax or Valium, he began self-medicating at 19 with marijuana and LSD, he says.

An arrest for possession of pot and LSD with intent to distribute landed him on probation. Facing regular drug tests that would detect cannabis, he turned to harder drugs that wouldn't stay in his urine as long. That's how Matthew, 28, first tried oxycodone.

Later, a doctor would prescribe opioids for chronic stomach pain, a condition he's had for six years.

It's the sort of pain, he says, that used to leave him racing to bathrooms so frequently, he couldn't keep a job. Multiple GI doctors have tried to help him. Only prescribed opioids and marijuana have offered relief.

Raised in the Eastern US, he now lives in rural Northern California and works as a consultant in the cannabis industry. He doesn't hide his marijuana use or his dependence on pain medications.

It's the powdered heroin he purchases on the dark net, the stuff he snorts in the bathroom a few times a day, that he keeps to himself. He says he uses it only when his prescriptions or insurance coverage lapse.

He's never used heroin intravenously. Having gone back and forth between pharmaceuticals and illegal supplies, he says he's able to use a milligram scale to carefully measure how much of the powder to take.

""It's similar to a dose of Percocet."" he says. ""The effect would be like downing a beer or a cocktail.""

He doesn't use a lot and says he snorts only about $5 of heroin a day. He's stopped in spurts and has written down pro and con lists to see whether he can move on. The pros keep winning out.

""I just don't find sober me is the best me,"" he says.

Having a secret can be isolating, he says, but otherwise, heroin has not hindered his life. Rather, Matthew says, ""It's changed my life for the better.""

Not only does it help with the pain, he says, it constipates him, allowing him to ditch the bathroom and get out of the house.

""I'm dependent,"" he says. ""But I wouldn't necessarily call myself an addict.""

The crippling truth

Matthew is kidding himself, experts say.

""Denial is a crippling component of addictive disease,"" Gitlow said. ""Here we have a well-documented illustration of that deadly component.""

Starting at 19, the signs were there when Matthew turned to drugs rather than ""conventional coping mechanisms,"" Gitlow explains. Someone without the addictive disease might have tried those drugs for temporary relief but then realized they weren't worth the long-term risk.

Matthew's belief that he doesn't have a problem, Gitlow says, is no different from a man with hypertension or diabetes pretending there's nothing wrong with him.

Plus, using heroin and other opioids changes brain chemistry, says Siobhan Morse, director of clinical services for the Foundations Recovery Network.

The natural way a body manages pain or stress, Morse says, is by producing endorphins.

""If you're giving it the artificial substance,"" she explains, the brain thinks it doesn't have to make the real thing. ""So when you take away the artificial substance, everything is so painful.""

And for people like Matthew who have coexisting mental health issues such as anxiety or depression, self-medication with opioids can make those matters worse, Morse adds. She describes the combination as a ""moving target.""

Eventually, she and other experts say, Matthew's drug use will catch up with him.

""I've never met anyone who's indefinitely held it down being a heroin addict,"" Morse says.

The fall of 'Superwoman'

Rebecca has been using for more than three decades -- longer than Matthew, Todd and Lisa combined. She is surprised to still be alive.

She grew up in an upper-middle-class household in a tony suburb in the South where she was raised more by the housekeeper than her parents. Her mother was checked out; her father had mistresses and often traveled.

""I didn't have any boundaries,"" says Rebecca, 59. ""I could do whatever I wanted, which was a recipe for disaster.""

Starting at 12, she tried every narcotic she could find. At 15, the man who was her drug dealer and boyfriend introduced her to heroin.

""I was in love,"" she says of the drug. ""It became the love of my life.""

One day, she was sleeping on the couch in her family's home when an older sister pinned her down, rolled up one of her sleeves and called out her track marks.

""Mom didn't bat an eye,"" Rebecca remembers. Instead, she shrugged it off, saying, ""Jewish people aren't addicts.""

Her father, when he was around, was more a friend than a parent. He partied with Rebecca and gave her Quaaludes, she says.

Rebecca eventually married the drug dealer-boyfriend, and they had a daughter. But the marriage was short-lived.

Divorced and 24, Rebecca went into treatment after her daughter turned 3. Rebecca knew that she was unfit to be a parent and feared she'd lose her daughter forever. It was the first of some 20 times she'd check into a treatment facility for help.

Along the way, she re-married; husband No. 2 died of a heroin overdose.

Rebecca met her third husband in treatment and stayed sober for eight years. They had two more children and a comfortable lifestyle, enjoying the sort of privileges she knew growing up. But when this marriage fell apart, so did she.

""That was when I started to spiral down,"" Rebecca says. ""As soon as I started using, it was immediate. ... It was like I never stopped using.""

Even as Rebecca returned to heroin, spending $100 or more a day, she built a career in corporate travel, working for big-name companies.

""As long as I didn't run out [of heroin] and get sick, I was like Superwoman,"" she says of her job performance. ""If I had come in and said I was a heroin addict, people would have laughed.""

Years of use caught up with her. Lunchtime runs to see her dealer grew longer and became lies about flat tires or broken-down cars. She bounced around between five or six companies, taking extended leaves to go into treatment or try to detox at home. She kept overdosing. A $30,000 mistake at work got her fired.

""People kept saying, 'You're going to die,' "" Rebecca says. ""The problem with me wasn't that I was going to die, it's that I was going to live.""

Her kids were mostly raised by other family members and knew her at her worst. They'd see her after overdoses and visit her in the ""nasty places"" she called home. ""It was just awful,"" says Rebecca, who's still working to repair the relationships she frayed.

Today, Rebecca is three years sober.

The last time she entered treatment, she says, ""something clicked, and I remember thinking, 'I can't do this anymore.' ""

She was ""sick and tired of being sick and tired,"" she says. ""I didn't have it in me anymore to keep doing what it took to stay high.""

Rebecca is not the only member of her family who's struggled. One relative is an alcoholic, another is also a heroin addict, and a third -- who won't touch heroin because of Rebecca -- is hooked on pain pills.

""It's in the genes,"" Rebecca says. ""No doubt.""

She has seven grandchildren and is determined to be a better grandmother than she was a parent. She lives with a friend in an apartment and works part time for a sober living community.

""If there's any regret, it's that I've missed decades,"" Rebecca says. ""I just thought I wasn't going to live, so I never worried about getting old.""

She is fighting to make the rest of her life matter, all the while knowing -- based on decades of experience -- how easily she could slip again.

One lapse, one moment of weakness or overconfidence that she can handle it, and everything Rebecca is building up could come crashing down and, quite possibly, bury her.",Inside the secret lives of functioning heroin addicts,http://cnn.com/2018/02/27/health/functioning-heroin-addicts/index.html
203,203,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"West Columbia, South Carolina (CNN) President Donald Trump said the one thing he's taken away from the family separation crisis on the southern border is that the detention facilities where undocumented immigrants are being held are nicer now than they were under President Barack Obama.

Trump, speaking in South Carolina on Monday night, contrasted the images released by his administration with 2014 photos that have spread in recent weeks. He said the images show him the detention facilities have improved.

""What I learned was one thing: Our facilities are cleaner, better kept and better run, that's the one thing I learned,"" he said.

Trump said he sees the national uproar over immigration policy as politically advantageous for Republicans.

""I said, 'Hey, this is fine for us,' "" Trump said of the controversy. ""The Democrats want open borders. They want anybody they want, including MS-13, pouring into the country. And the Democrats don't like ICE -- these are great, brave, tough people. ... They don't like Border Patrol, they don't like your police, they don't like anybody.""

Trump was visiting ""famously hot"" Columbia, South Carolina, to campaign for Gov. Henry McMaster, who faces Republican challenger John Warren on Tuesday. Trump publicly backed McMaster after he was forced into a runoff election when he failed to clear 50% in a primary earlier this month.

Trump also touted his administration's efforts to renegotiate trade deals, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, and to reverse a trade deficit with China. He railed about German auto tariffs, even as German automaker BMW makes SUVs in South Carolina. The automaker's largest plant is in Greer, South Carolina, about two hours' drive from where Trump spoke Monday.

The President pointed to his top trade adviser, who was in the audience, saying: ""I tell you what, Peter Navarro does like tariffs. He likes them probably more than I do.""

In stark contrast to Trump's use of titles for other world leaders, including ""Chairman Kim"" for North Korea's Kim Jong Un, he prodded Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau by using his first name.

""What's your problem, Justin?"" Trump said.

During the 45-minute speech, the President also went on a long riff about late-night television hosts.

""This guy on CBS has no talent,"" he said of Stephen Colbert, who he also called a ""lowlife.""

He cast ABC's Jimmy Kimmel as a suck-up, saying Kimmel ""would stand outside of the sidewalk waiting for me"" and thank Trump for appearing on his show.

The President called NBC's Jimmy Fallon ""a nice guy"" but said Fallon shouldn't have apologized later for tousling Trump's hair during an election season appearance rather than asking him tough questions.

""When you apologize because you got somebody else that didn't go on the other shows?"" Trump said. ""Jimmy, be a man. Just relax. Just relax.""

He also said Fallon ""looks like a lost soul.""

Trump had more to say about hair.

He asked the audience if anyone was wearing a hairpiece, and said that, contrary to a popular point of curiosity during the 2016 campaign, his is real.

""They never say that anymore because I've been caught in rainstorms. I've been caught in winds that were like 60 miles an hour,"" he said. ""If it's not your hair, don't run for office, folks. Don't run for office, because the gig would be up.""

Trump also declared his own audience America's ""super-elites.""

""You're smarter, you're better, you're more loyal. We have the greatest base in the history of politics. We do,"" he said.

Of the Iraq War, Trump said, ""I believe it was the worst decision in the history of our country.""

Trump spent about five minutes talking about McMaster, both at the beginning and the end of his speech. He told the crowd the ""fake news"" would love the ""humiliating"" storyline of a Trump-endorsed governor losing.

""So please get your asses out tomorrow and vote,"" he said.

After being forced into a runoff, McMaster called the President, asking for his support, according to a source familiar with the call. Trump handily won the 2016 Republican presidential primary here.

One White House official described the ""easy"" decision to travel to the state for McMaster, saying, ""He was an early and fervent supporter of President Trump's."" This official previewed an upcoming schedule for the President that would include ""more endorsements and events"" now that many of the primaries have occurred.

McMaster was one of the first elected officials to endorse then-candidate Trump in 2016. McMaster was at the White House in late May, where he joined a few other Republican governors for dinner to discuss protecting the US border with Mexico. McMaster has pledged South Carolina National Guard troops to help with that effort.

Perhaps the only issue on which McMaster has publicly split from the Trump administration is offshore drilling on the coast of South Carolina. A spokesman for the governor told CNN earlier this year that McMaster had appealed to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke about the issue.

McMaster said in a statement earlier this week, ""President Trump and Vice President Pence are changing the world,"" and that their willingness to campaign for him showed ""a testament to the success of our great state.""

""They've stood by each other in the presidential race. They're very like-minded individuals and they have a lot of the same priorities. I think that's part of the reason why they have such a close relationship,"" said campaign press secretary Carolina Anderegg. She said the two men speak ""often"" either personally or between their staffs.

205,205,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) President Donald Trump is taking his trade policy on the road this week. But the reception he is set to receive in a series of crucial 2018 states may not be what he had hoped.

A series of threatening trade wars have become a weight on the President and Republicans across the country, leading to innumerable negative headlines and general anxiousness about what a spat with China, the European Union or even Canada and Mexico will mean to long established industries in the United States that employ thousands of workers.

Trump is set to travel to South Carolina, North Dakota and Wisconsin this week, all states with significant industries impacted by proposed retaliatory tariffs against American products. The President has been confident that his trade rhetoric would help American industries -- ""Trade wars are good and easy to win,"" he has said -- but the uncertainty created has left Republicans worried that they will end up paying the price at the ballot box in November.

""It's not lost on us,"" said a top Republican operative involved in the midterms, ""that the trade agenda could turn into a total debacle that would far outweigh the economic benefits of tax reform.""

The most recent flashpoint in the nationwide debate over trade is taking place in Wisconsin, where the iconic motorcycle company Harley-Davidson announced on Monday that they were shifting some production of motorcycles for European customers out of the United States to avoid European Union retaliatory tariffs. The company said they stood to lose up to $100 million a year if they continued to produce all bikes in the United States.

US Secretary of Defense James Mattis made the decision to ""indefinitely suspend select exercises,"" the department said in a statement, with those exercises including the upcoming Freedom Guardian drills in August and two Korean Marine Exchange Program training exercises.

US President Donald Trump unexpectedly announced the decision to suspend US drills with South Korea at a press conference following his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12.

Trump described the ""war games"" as ""very provocative"" and ""tremendously expensive"" during the press conference, and said he'd decided to put them on hold while negotiations with Pyongyang were ongoing.

208,208,2018-06-21 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Portsmouth, UK (CNN) The relatives of more than 450 patients who died after being over-prescribed drugs while in hospital have called for the British government to accept culpability for their deaths.

""There was a disregard for human life and a culture of shortening the lives of a large number of patients,"" the report said, adding that the hospital's policy of administering opioids was ""without medical justification.""

Ann Reeves' mother, Elsie Devine, was admitted to hospital to help her recover from a urinary tract infection, and was one of those killed while in the hospital's care. She died just four weeks after being hospitalized, and Reeves believes that it was the high doses of pain medication that were responsible.

""It would kill you, it would kill anybody,"" she told CNN. ""She had no chance.""

The report alleges that Jane Barton, a doctor and clinical assistant who visited the ward daily, was to blame for the hospital's drug policy. Over the course of 11 years, from 1989 to 2000, at least 456 people died after being given diamorphine -- synthetic heroin -- as a painkiller, under the direction of Barton, the report said.

The report found that another 200 patients potentially had their lives shortened by the drugs administered by nurses on the ward under Barton's direction.

Barton, who was found guilty of ""serious professional misconduct"" and censured for a failure of care of 12 patients between 1996 and 1999 but never prosecuted nor struck off the medical record, maintained that she had always prioritized her patients' interests.

""Throughout my career I have tried to do my very best for all my patients and have had only their interests and well being at heart,"" she said in a statement in 2010, according to the BBC. She retired soon after.

'I'm her voice now'

Wednesday's report, which claims the hospital, local and national authorities failed to act in ways that ""protected patients and relatives,"" is a partial vindication for Reeves, who has spent 19 years searching for the truth.

But she says she won't rest until the government faces its role in the tragedy.

""I'm her voice now, and I will not stop, until someone in this government, in the Department of Health, can sit me down and say, 'this is why we gave your mother those drugs'.""

On Wednesday, British Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologized ""on behalf of the government and the NHS,"" for the deaths, referring to the country's National Health Service.

In a foreword to the report, the panel's chair, Rev. James Jones, said that relatives' attempts to find answers to the patient deaths ""had been repeatedly frustrated by senior figures,"" and that their ""anger is also fueled by a sense of betrayal.""

Jones added that admitting a loved one to the care of medical professionals ""is an act of trust and you take for granted that they will always do that which is best for the one you love.""

""It represents a major crisis when you begin to doubt that the treatment they are being given is in their best interests. It further shatters your confidence when you summon up the courage to complain and then sense that you are being treated as some sort of 'troublemaker',"" he said.

According to Reeves, health authorities took advantage of her mother's generation's trust in the medical profession.

""My mum came from a time when they though doctors were gods,"" she said. ""They believed everything a doctor said. But the world has moved on now. We've got the internet, we've got the process of checking what drugs we have, and certainly for us, we will always be checking the medical file and making sure that we know what's going on.""

The report references serial killer Harold Shipman, a British doctor who was found guilty of murdering 15 of his elderly patients, along with one count of forging a patient's will.

209,209,2018-06-14 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Hundreds of migrants who were left to drift in the Mediterranean after Italy and Malta turned them away arrived in Spain on Sunday, ending, at least temporarily, a political crisis in Europe over policing the continent's southern border.

The rescued migrants and refugees were traveling on three ships: the Aquarius, operated by the charities SOS Méditerranée and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), an Italian naval ship and an Italian coastguard vessel.

Aquarius, which was originally carrying more than 600 rescued migrants, was left stranded in the Mediterranean for two days after Matteo Salvini, Italy's hardline interior minister and leader of the anti-immigration League party, refused to allow it to dock last Sunday. After Spain offered to take in the survivors, the ship started an 800-mile journey to the city of Valencia along with the two Italian ships, which were sent to ease the overcrowding.

Here's what the journey has been like for those on board:

Wednesday, June 13

Conditions on board the Aquarius worsened on Wednesday as poor weather and large waves caused dozens of people to suffer from seasickness.

🔴 UPDATE: Deteriorating weather: Waves up to 4m & winds up to 35 knots until tomorrow. Many people are seasick and receive treatment. Yet another unnecessary suffering for the 630 rescued people - after Libya, fearful hours on rubber boats and 4 days on 3 different boat decks. pic.twitter.com/81rvemMdwt — SOS MEDITERRANEE GER (@SOSMedGermany) June 13, 2018

At least 80 people who were pulled out of the sea by rescuers over the weekend had to be treated by doctors as waves as much as four meters high and winds of 65 kilometers per hour buffeted the vessel, according to Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which operates the rescue ship alongside SOS Méditerranée.

🔴 UPDATE ""My head is turning, I keep on vomiting, it's not easy"", says a man on the #Aquarius. Last night all men still on the outside deck were transferred to the shelter for their safety.

That included pregnant women and a mother ""who was breastfeeding her baby while vomiting at the same time,"" Aloys Vimards, MSF project coordinator on board the Aquarius, told CNN.

""In the evening, we had to move the men sleeping on the outside deck to the shelter usually reserved (for) women and children, for safety reasons,"" SOS Méditerranée's Julie Mélichar told CNN.

Around 250 people were transferred from the Aquarius to the Italian Navy's Orione and a further 274 to the Coast Guard vessel Dattilo, SOS Méditerranée said.

The bad weather forced the vessel to change course along the eastern coast of Sardinia in company with ships from the Italian Coast Guard and Navy.

""This course should shelter the ships from the worst of the weather,"" Vimards told CNN.

""We have just finished a morning food distribution for everyone of oranges, cereal bars and croissants with some iced tea. This is the food we received from the Italian Coast Guard yesterday to resupply us. People are still feeling very unwell as a result of the sea conditions,"" Vimards said.

That night, the Aquarius received supplies from the Italian Coast Guard, including nuts, dried bananas, dehydrated soups and toys for the children.

The weather was warm throughout the day. ""Many people were on the deck looking at Sardinia on the background, playing chess, or sleeping outside on the floor,"" SOS Méditerranée's Julie Mélichar told CNN. ""It was the first land they saw since they left Libya last Friday. Most people were asking what it was, why couldn't we go there.""

Despite the calm weather, the rescued people were exhausted, many asking how many more days of navigation are left and when they will reach Spain, Mélichar said. ""They've been at sea for six days now,"" she said. ""One day on the riverboat, five on the deck of the Aquarius and before that months or even years in the hell of Libya.""

Friday, June 15

The Aquarius started to sail away from Sardinia, leaving behind the island of Asinara. The weather worsened overnight after calming down on the previous evening.

Doctors Without Borders did breakfast distribution with food that was delivered by the Italian Coast Guard.

An MSF team serves rescued people breakfast on Friday made from food supplies delivered to the Aquarius the previous day.

""People were starting to feel seasick again this morning with the MSF medical team again bust handing out seasickness medications,"" Aloys Vimards, MSF project coordinator on board the Aquarius, told CNN.

The Aquarius is expected to dock in Valencia on Sunday morning.

MSF and SOS Méditerranée were also told of two people who are missing and presumed dead.

""These 2 men, Sudanese & Nigerian, lost their lives during a critical rescue at night time,"" SOS Med tweeted.

MSF shared the story of one of the men who was rescued from the water. Ibrahim, 20, said he went to Libya for work but on his arrival was auctioned off.

The owner got drunk, he is quoted as saying. ""He came and took some other black men to his truck, and shot them. A friend and I had to pick up the bodies and bury them.""

The Spanish island of Menorca can now be seen in the distance from the boats, MSF Spain said.

The Spanish Red Cross shared details of its preparations for the expected arrival Sunday of the three vessels, which will dock in Valencia at intervals of three hours to help manage the process. Pregnant women and those who are sick will be taken to local hospitals.

MSF tweeted that its midwife on the Aquarius was helping to care for the pregnant women on board after their rescue from the sea.

Sunday, June 17

There was relief and joy among migrants on board the first of three ships to arrive at Valencia harbor.

The Italian Coast Guard bessel Dattilo arrived just before 7 a.m. Sunday morning and was due to be followed by the Aquarius and an Italian navy ship.

Applause could be heard on board the first ship as it docked.

Medical staff in white overalls, gloves and masks immediately boarded the boat to carry out first medical checks.

The migrants, mainly from Africa, were welcomed by a team of more than 2,300 people, including 1,000 Red Cross volunteers, 600 police officers and 400 translators, according to local authorities.",What it's like on board the migrant ship to Spain,http://cnn.com/2018/06/14/europe/migrant-ship-italy-spain-intl/index.html
210,210,2018-05-03 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) A few years ago, when my girls were in the second and third grades, they raved about the dance breaks they would occasionally have during the school day.

Their teachers would put on a video, which encouraged the kids to get up and dance, and then they'd get back to work.

""What a brilliant idea,"" I remember thinking at the time.

My kids' teachers were certainly not alone. More teachers are incorporating some form of movement into the school day, especially as the research is pretty clear: Physical activity in school leads to better cognitive performance and fewer behavioral issues, not to mention cutting down on stress and anxiety.

Groups such as the National Association of Physical Literacy tout the importance of teaching kids to move while they're young so that they will make movement part of their lives when they grow up.

It all seems like a no-brainer, especially as research shows that childhood obesity seems to be getting worse . As former first lady Michelle Obama advocated, let's get our kids to move.

The challenge, though, is persuading school administrations to consistently make time for physical activity when they are pressed to meet stringent academic requirements and find the money to pay for some of the training.

Research: Physical activity benefits students

Just as our schools teach math literacy and reading literacy, they can teach physical literacy, teaching children the basics of movement so that they can stay active for life, said Susan Kamin, chief wellness officer for the National Association of Physical Literacy.

The for-profit association provides in-person and online training to teachers and communities and provides ""BrainErgizer"" videos, five-minute movement videos developed in conjunction with the University of Connecticut based on research on what stimulates the brain.

Dr. John Ratey , an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, says activity breaks during the school day create better learners because of the impact of movement on the brain.

""When you move, you stimulate all the nerve cells that we use to think with, and when you stimulate those nerve cells, it gets them ready to do stuff,"" said Ratey, an expert in neuropsychiatry and author of ""Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain"" who has spent the past 30 years focusing on the ""attention systems"" of the brain.

""When you exercise, you turn on the attention systems, so that means you're (paying) better attention, you're able to deal with more frustration, you're able to stay with it longer,"" he said. ""You're able to manipulate information by turning ... on the front part of our brain to make it work better, and that's really key and important in terms of taking in information as well as performing with it.""

A recent study, a review of 26 previous studies looking at the impact of physical activity on academic performance, found that kids who get extra physical activity in school do better in reading and math.

The study, published in the journal Pediatrics , involved more than 10,000 children between the ages of 4 and 13. It found that physical activity, especially physical education, improves behavior in classrooms and is a boost to academic achievement, especially math-related skills and reading.

""The research shows that it leads to better cognitive function for kids so they're going to have better results, academically,"" Kamin said. ""It's also going to help with behavioral issues in the classroom, because if kids are able to move, they're not going to have so much excess energy. They're going to be able to focus, and it's going to solve a lot of the sort of interpersonal issues that come up with kids as well, because they're going to have an opportunity to get that energy out.""

Breakthrough Magnet School, South, a pre-K through eighth-grade school in Hartford, Connecticut, is in its third year working with the National Association of Physical Literacy. The school had valued movement and mindfulness before, but since the partnership, the school has received additional training and is making physical literacy a key part of the classroom experience, Principal Julie Goldstein said.

""I think it really validates a lot of what teachers know: that students need movement, they need planned opportunities for movement and that it can be done in a pretty short, simple way throughout the day and that the benefits of it outweigh the little bit of planning that is necessary in the beginning to kind of get that structured,"" Goldstein said.

Her third- and fourth-graders who are actively engaged in physical literacy are the highest-scoring students in math and literacy within the district, she said. Beyond the benefits academically, there are benefits outside the classroom. For this school year, not one student from this group has been referred to her office for a conversation with the principal. Before they started doing physical literacy, she might have had one or two office referrals every month, she said.

""This particular grade level is at the highest risk for misunderstandings, disagreements and even injuries at recess time, and we've had none, so the impact that it is has goes far beyond just the academic and the behaviors in the classroom,"" she said. ""Even during the unstructured times, they're better able to manage themselves, to play independently and to do that in a way so that the recess time actually serves them the way it's intended to, which is to give them time to play and have fun.""

Using screens to get kids moving

Four out of five elementary schools in the United States are using videos from the education company GoNoodle to promote physical activity in the classroom, the company says.

The concept is simple: Today's kids have grown up with screens, so GoNoodle tries to use entertaining videos, often about two minutes in length, that will get kids to move around and then either get back to their schoolwork or go off and play with friends.

KC Estenson is the chief executive officer of GoNoodle, a for-profit company that makes money through relationships with partners who believe in the company's mission. (The videos are free for schools and parents, although teachers can pay for GoNoodle+, which for $10 a month gives them access to additional videos, games and classroom resources.)

Estenson -- who is the former head of CNN Digital -- is a father of three who, like most parents, has struggled with how much time his kids, ages 8, 12 and 14, spend on screens during the day.

""GoNoodle gets kids to move. It gets them to be active,"" Estenson said. ""The entire purpose of this is a whole new interaction form with the screen, which is active engagement versus passive engagement, and most television and most of what's happening with the technology now of all ages is passive, binge viewing, hours spent just watching the screen and doing nothing else.""

The key, he said, is making entertaining content that children (the target group is ages 5 to 12, grades K-6) will enjoy so much that they'll want to get up and dance or do yoga or even some form of meditation and mindfulness.

""And so starting from the earliest age ... we're putting positive associations between the right things that are available to them on these screens and hopefully giving them an awesome alternative to the junk food that's out there,"" said Estenson.

'It really validates ... what teachers know'

Active Schools, which was founded as part of Obama's Let's Move initiative, is a national movement, partnering with nonprofits and for profits to try to make physical education and physical activity a bigger part of the school day.

The goal is at least 60 minutes of activity per day, which is crucial especially since many kids don't get the play time children used to get outside of school decades ago. There are a variety of reasons why, including the widespread use of digital devices and a lack of access to and time for free play.

""One of the biggest pieces of feedback we get from schools in the field is, 'we are very busy places. We appreciate what everyone offers, but it's overwhelming. Can you make it easier for us to know what's available?' "" said Charlene Burgeson, executive director of Active Schools.

Streamlining to make it less cumbersome for schools to learn what resources are available and what programs they can bring to their school is one challenge. The others are money, time and philosophy.

Schools can't always find the funding to pay for formal training, videos and other programs that get kids moving. There is also the pressure of the clock and having enough time to work physical activity in when trying to meet the required academic standards and complete the curriculum.

""I know lots of teachers who say, 'Yeah, I wish I had more time to do this,' "" the National Association of Physical Literacy's Kamin said. Even in schools that can find the time, there is still some opposition because it's a departure from the way things used to be, she said.

212,212,2018-05-22 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) It's become a numbing Washington ritual. Donald Trump shatters a traditional boundary on the exercise of presidential power. Or he uses inflammatory language that stirs racial animosities. Or he's hit by new revelations in the overlapping investigations into his campaign's contacts with foreign governments in 2016 and his own tangled financial and personal affairs before the presidency.

As each of these bombshells detonate, sometimes within hours of each other, congressional Republican leaders then react with little more than a shrug. Even more important, the vast majority of the Republican electoral coalition increasingly responds the same way.

All of these dynamics played out multiple times this past week. Trump shattered boundaries by openly demanding the Department of Justice investigate the ongoing special counsel examination of his campaign and by privately pressuring the US Postal Service to raise rates on Amazon , whose owner, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Washington Post, which Trump considers an enemy. He used George Wallace-like language in describing members of the MS-13 gang as ""animals."" And he faced the startling revelation that during the 2016 campaign his son Donald Trump Jr., who had earlier convened with Russians offering damaging information on Hillary Clinton, also met with emissaries of Middle Eastern governments offering to help in the election.

After all that, Republicans responded this week with the sort of silence usually expected from the crowd at the 18th hole of a golf tournament.

The Trump paradox

The elimination of any distance between Trump and the conventional Republican interests that controlled the party before him has happened so incrementally it can be difficult to discern from day to day. But it remains one of the central political dynamics of 2018. Over the long term, Trump's success at stamping his polarizing brand on the GOP remains a huge electoral gamble for the party because it risks alienating the young, well-educated and diverse groups growing, rather than shrinking, in the electorate.

But in the near-term, the GOP's choice to ally so unequivocally with such a unique president may have the paradoxical effect of producing a much more conventional midterm election than seemed possible earlier this year. And that means for Democrats to secure the gains they seek in November, they will need to overcome the typical challenges they face in a midterm election far more than they expected even only a few months ago.

In both 2010 and 2014, the two midterm elections under Barack Obama, Democrats suffered huge losses. Each time the party faced similar problems. The biggest was a collapse in turnout among young voters, and a smaller, but still significant, decline among minorities. In both 2010 and 2014, the share of the vote cast by young adults 18-29, a strongly Democratic-leaning group, was fully six percentage points lower than in the presidential race just two years earlier, according to exit polls.

Each time, the non-white share of the vote dropped three points compared to the previous presidential contest. In turn, seniors, who now lean strongly toward the GOP, represented a significantly greater share of the vote in each midterm than in the previous presidential race.

Those turnout problems for Democrats were compounded by anemic performances among white men and women without a college degree, and white men with degrees. In both 2010 and 2014, according to exit polls, Democratic congressional candidates carried no more than 36% of voters in each of those groups. The party's performance among college-educated white women was better (43% in 2010 and 47% in 2014) but still below their strongest showings with those women in recent years.

Through much of 2017, it appeared possible that Trump's general weakness might solve all of these traditional Democratic problems -- or at least render them inconsequential.

Especially during the extended Republican struggle to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Trump's presidency sometimes seemed at risk of functional collapse under the combined pressure of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russian election meddling investigation, internal administrative chaos and incompetence, chronic divisions between the White House and congressional Republicans and the president's inability or unwillingness to control a belligerent and volatile temperament.

It's still possible any of those factors -- or some combination of them -- could politically debilitate Trump or, much less likely, even force him for office. But it no longer seems plausible that he will simply implode.

Rather over the past several months -- particularly since the passage of the GOP tax plan late last year -- Trump has shown clear signs of consolidating more of the usual Republican institutional and electoral base than he had earlier, despite all the norm-breaking excesses of his presidency. His approval rating in most polls has moved up from the high thirties to the low forties. That's still weaker than it should be given the robust economy, but a clear sign that he has recaptured many traditionally center-right voters. Over that same period, the tightening generic ballot test measuring preferences for the 2018 election show much of that same support drifting back, like metal filings toward a magnet, around congressional Republicans.

That doesn't mean Democrats can't retake the House or conceivably even the Senate in 2018 or beat Trump in 2020. But it does mean they can't rely on Republican disarray to power those victories. Despite all of Trump's unique liabilities, the key institutions and voter blocks of red America show every sign of mobilizing to maintain their control of power in Washington.

Support for Trump in key groups

Since he took office, Trump's approval rating has always been high among self-identified Republicans and core Republican groups. The most recent national polls from CNN and the Pew Research Center , for instance, both put his approval rating among white men without a college degree at a robust 66%. More than three-fifths of those men also said they intend to support Republican candidates for Congress this fall.

Even more telling may be the preferences the polls recorded among two groups of generally Republican-leaning white voters who Democrats have hoped would abandon the GOP under Trump: white men with a college degree, and white women without one. The two polls vary slightly in their measurement of how those voters view Trump himself: in the CNN poll, both groups give him an approval rating around 50%, while in the Pew Survey, he draws about 45% approval from both.

Yet both surveys show that Republicans now hold a solid lead with both groups in their preferences for the midterm election. Both surveys show Republicans now drawing over 50% of college-educated white men, while among blue-collar women Pew puts the GOP slightly above 50% and CNN shows them just slightly below. In each survey, Democrats are winning only about two-fifths of both groups. Those advantages aren't as lopsided as Republicans enjoyed in 2010 or 2014, but if they endure, they may be sufficient to blunt the Democrats' gains in 2018.

A shift to Democrats by college-educated women

The clearest improvement for Democrats from 2010 and 2014 is that both polls show Trump facing disapproval from about two-thirds of college-educated white women. Almost exactly three-fifths of those women in each survey say they plan to vote Democratic in November. That's significantly more than Democrats have won among that group in any congressional election since 1992, according to exit polls, and that shift alone could allow them to capture several seats Republicans hold in white-collar suburbs. The 2017 elections also have demonstrated a high level of engagement among African-American voters, especially women-and they register passionate distaste for Trump in polls.

But if those are the only ways the electorate in 2018 differs from 2010 and 2014, Democrats would likely be disappointed in the results. The party is betting on greater engagement from its core voters than among Republicans, but a succession of Trump policy decisions aimed at energizing the GOP base (such as hardline approaches to immigration) may be narrowing that gap: the CNN survey showed only a modest six percentage point gap between the share of Republican and Democratic-leaning voters who said they were very enthusiastic about voting.

And while recent reports show voter registration rising among younger voters in some key states, the proportion of younger adults who say they are closely following news about the election was far lower than for any other age group in the Pew poll. That's despite the deep opposition to Trump that they register in all surveys.

The headwinds facing Republicans in November remain formidable: the last three times one party went into a midterm election with unified control of government (the Democrats in 1994 and 2010 and the Republicans in 2006) voters revoked it. Trump's approval rating after his recent gains is higher than George W. Bush's was at the time of the 2006 Republican loss, but still lower than Obama or Bill Clinton during their midterm defeats. And while polls show mixed evidence of a Democratic turnout advantage in November, in practice, party voters have stampeded to the polls in the actual elections held since Trump took office. Fundraising for Democrats is astronomical as well.

But compared to six months ago, the constant gales swirling around Trump no longer look as certain to blow away all of the GOP's traditional midterm advantages. Nor does it appear likely that any new revelation in the various investigations of Trump will dissolve support for him or the GOP Congress. As in earlier midterm elections, mobilizing young people still looks like a challenge for Democrats, as does persuading more blue-collar white women and white-collar white men.

In other words, even with all of the turmoil around Trump, there is no cavalry coming to rescue blue America from Republican dominance of Washington. Democrats will need to storm those gates themselves, beginning with finding ways to overcome the resurfacing obstacles that have hurt them so badly in midterm elections before.",Beating Republicans in November will be harder than Democrats thought,http://cnn.com/2018/05/22/politics/beating-republicans-in-november-will-be-harder-than-democrats-thought/index.html

(CNN) We met Ronald Lewis in September 2017 and heard his desire to be a great dad and role model for his children. After being introduced to him by Community Legal Services in Philadelphia, he explained everything he had gone through. More than a decade ago, he was arrested when he warned his brother, who was selling drugs, that the cops were coming. Less than a month later, he was caught when he foolishly tried to shoplift.

These cases resulted in two misdemeanor convictions, with no jail time and probation that was terminated early. He didn't know it at the time, but that one bad month would haunt him for years to come. Even though Lewis matured and took on family responsibilities, his criminal record caused him to be turned away from countless jobs for which he was otherwise qualified. As he has said , ""So many doors have been shut in my face, I know what wood tastes like.""

Many others like Lewis have had brushes with police that led to their getting arrested, like the two men doing nothing more than waiting at a Philadelphia Starbucks in April. Even if the charges are dropped, the arrest stays on their record, unless they find a lawyer to file an expungement petition. They lose jobs, too. We met Lewis last September after we learned about Pennsylvania's proposed Clean Slate Act , legislation that could help people like Lewis. We could hear the remorse in his voice. It is only common sense to give people a second chance.

Nearly 9 in 10 employers say they perform criminal background checks on all or some job candidates, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. One case study shows 4 in 5 landlords use criminal background checks in rental screenings. One in 5 colleges and universities conduct criminal background checks on certain applicants, according to the Center for Community Alternatives.

Even the most minor criminal records, like ones that stem from possession of marijuana, disorderly conduct or being falsely accused, can haunt someone for life, causing them to miss out on access to jobs, housing and education. This is a problem with national scope, but as players who have lived and worked in the Philadelphia community, we are especially aware of its impact in the state of Pennsylvania. Old, minor criminal records contribute to keeping hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians trapped in poverty, with opportunity just out of reach.

Fortunately, there's a plan in the works that would be a game-changer for people with minor criminal records. The Clean Slate Act, proposed legislation that has support from both Republicans and Democrats in the Pennsylvania Legislature, would use technology to automatically seal charges that did not lead to convictions, along with some nonviolent misdemeanor convictions, after 10 years. That means that employers, landlords and schools wouldn't be able to see these minor records. People who need opportunities would be judged by who they really are, not by their old mistakes.

Even better, all Pennsylvanians would benefit from a Clean Slate program. People with minor records would better be able to provide for their families and contribute to their communities. Employers would be able to hire the best people possible, based on their skills and their potential. Neighborhoods where large percentages of people are shut out of the labor force by their records and our entire economy would thrive.

Clean Slate is such a good idea that people from very different perspectives agree on it. Chambers of Commerce from around the state, the Pennsylvania Council of Churches, the cities of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, conservative organizations like FreedomWorks, liberal organizations like the Center for American Progress, and many others support the bill.

215,215,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Washington (CNN) I noted in this space last week that President Donald Trump had tied his highest approval ratings -- 45% -- in Gallup's weekly poll. A week can change a lot, apparently.

In Gallup's new weekly poll released Monday, Trump's approval rating had cooled off to 41% while his disapproval shot up 5 percentage points -- up to 55%. It's easy to ascribe Trump's approval fade to his disastrous past week in which he badly underestimated the damage done by his administration's ""zero-tolerance"" policy at the border. Trump eventually flip-flopped on his insistence that an executive order wouldn't solve the family separation crisis but, even then, legal and logistical questions remained.

But in truth, Trump's 41% approval could well be simply a return to normal. After all, Trump has averaged 39% approval in Gallup polling for the totality of his presidency to date. Trump's numbers among Republicans remain strong (90% approval last week, 87% this week) and his numbers among Democrats remain dismal (10% approval last week, 5% this week).

Seen through that lens, Trump's numbers last week are the exception; his numbers this week are the rule. And it's not totally clear how Republicans should feel about that fact.

On the one hand, Republicans remain extremely positive about Trump -- usually a sign the base of the party is activated and ready for the fall elections. On the other, the history of presidents under 50% approval in a midterm election is absolutely disastrous for the GOP. The average loss for the party in power is 36 House seats!

Trump's 45% showing last week had given some Republicans hopes that he might, maybe, make it close to 50% approval before November. Those hopes seem to have been short-lived. If you believe Gallup's long-term trend -- and you should -- the most likely place for Trump to wind up in November is somewhere between 39% and 42% in approval.

The Point: Trump is Trump. For every step forward there is (at least) one step back. Republicans need to just make peace with that reality.",Meet Trump's new approval rating. Same as his old approval rating.,http://cnn.com/2018/06/25/politics/trump-approval-rating-analysis/index.html

(CNN) Russia's World Cup is off to a mesmerizing start on the field -- in the first round of competition, the Russian team itself has exceeded its low expectations. Things have been a little rocky off the pitch -- Burger King Russia has just been forced to apologize for running an ad offering Russian women the chance to win a cash prize and Whoppers for life if they got impregnated by a World Cup star, not long after a senior Russian lawmaker exhorted Russian women to only sleep with Russian men during the World Cup ""to give birth to our own"" -- but overall, smoother perhaps than expected.

But no matter how successful the tournament turns out to be, President Vladimir Putin's gambit to leverage the soft power of international sport to burnish Russia's image abroad will fall well short of its ambitions. These major sporting events that capture global attention have long provided governments an opportunity to present a warm and fuzzy face to the world, but the world is already too familiar with Putin's regime -- the silencing of domestic critics, the annexation of Crimea, the support for Syria's murderous Bashar al-Assad, and the meddling in foreign elections -- to buy warm and fuzzy.

To much of the world, Russia has become what it was simplistically seen as by Americans at the height of the Cold War: a nation of Bond villains.

Putin looked unchastened presiding over the Cup's opening match last week, being chummy with FIFA President Gianni Infantino, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, whose team was Russia's opponent that day. The Saudi visit was a coup for the Kremlin, but otherwise it's a rather meager crop of foreign leaders coming to Moscow for Putin's party.

Putin launched his quest to Make Russia Great Again in sport, harkening back to Soviet superpower days, with the 2014 Winter Olympic Games held in Sochi. Those Olympics, which Russia reportedly spent $50 billion on, went far more smoothly than people had expected beforehand. But by the next Winter Olympic Games, held earlier this year in South Korea, even the International Olympic Committee, a body hardly known for taking bold moral stands, felt compelled to treat Putin's Russia as a pariah nation.

217,217,2018-06-22 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) James Madison never had a cell phone -- not even a flip phone! But the Supreme Court is frequently called on to conjure what Madison and the other framers of the Constitution might have made of our world, one very different from the one they knew.

On Friday, a deeply divided court considered whether the police could track the location of a cell phone, and thus the person who uses it, without first obtaining a search warrant. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote, ""The question we confront today is how to apply the Fourth Amendment to a new phenomenon: the ability to chronicle a person's past movements through the record of his cell phone signals.""

The case had a straightforward origin. In 2011, the police in Detroit learned of a group of men who were robbing (irony alert) T-Mobile stores, among other places. The police knew the phone numbers of some of the suspects, and they used cell tower information to track their movements. They arrested Timothy Carpenter, who was convicted of multiple counts related to the robberies and sentenced to more than a hundred years in prison.

He challenged the evidence in his appeal, and the court in Carpenter v. United States, by a vote of 5-4, overturned his conviction on the ground that the police had not first obtained a search warrant for the cell data. (Carpenter will likely face a new trial.)

The central issue in the case, according to the court's precedents, was a deceptively simple one: did the defendant have a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" in the cell phone data obtained by the police? Do cell phone users -- that is, pretty much everyone -- have a reasonable belief that the police will not track their movements through their phones? At one extreme, it's clear that we expect the police will not listen to our phone calls without a warrant.

220,220,2018-02-11 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) California's insurance commissioner has launched an investigation into Aetna after learning a former medical director for the insurer admitted under oath he never looked at patients' records when deciding whether to approve or deny care.

California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones expressed outrage after CNN showed him a transcript of the testimony and said his office is looking into how widespread the practice is within Aetna.

""If the health insurer is making decisions to deny coverage without a physician actually ever reviewing medical records, that's of significant concern to me as insurance commissioner in California -- and potentially a violation of law,"" he said.

Aetna, the nation's third-largest insurance provider with 23.1 million customers, told CNN it looked forward to ""explaining our clinical review process"" to the commissioner.

The California probe centers on a deposition by Dr. Jay Ken Iinuma, who served as medical director for Aetna for Southern California from March 2012 to February 2015, according to the insurer.

During the deposition, the doctor said he was following Aetna's training, in which nurses reviewed records and made recommendations to him.

Jones said his expectation would be ""that physicians would be reviewing treatment authorization requests,"" and that it's troubling that ""during the entire course of time he was employed at Aetna, he never once looked at patients' medical records himself.""

""It's hard to imagine that in that entire course in time, there weren't any cases in which a decision about the denial of coverage ought to have been made by someone trained as a physician, as opposed to some other licensed professional,"" Jones told CNN.

""That's why we've contacted Aetna and asked that they provide us information about how they are making these claims decisions and why we've opened this investigation.""

The insurance commissioner said Californians who believe they may have been adversely affected by Aetna's decisions should contact his office

Members of the medical community expressed similar shock, saying Iinuma's deposition leads to questions about Aetna's practices across the country.

""Oh my God. Are you serious? That is incredible,"" said Dr. Anne-Marie Irani when told of the medical director's testimony. Irani is a professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the Children's Hospital of Richmond at VCU and a former member of the American Board of Allergy and Immunology's board of directors.

""This is potentially a huge, huge story and quite frankly may reshape how insurance functions,"" said Dr. Andrew Murphy, who, like Irani, is a renowned fellow of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. He recently served on the academy's board of directors.

The Gillen Washington case

Gillen Washington, 23, says he hopes to force change at Aetna.

The deposition by Aetna's former medical director came as part of a lawsuit filed against Aetna by a college student who suffers from a rare immune disorder. The case is expected to go to trial later this week in California Superior Court.

Gillen Washington, 23, is suing Aetna for breach of contract and bad faith, saying he was denied coverage for an infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) when he was 19. His suit alleges Aetna's ""reckless withholding of benefits almost killed him.""

Aetna has rejected the allegations, saying Washington failed to comply with their requests for blood work. Washington, who was diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency, or CVID, in high school, became a new Aetna patient in January 2014 after being insured by Kaiser.

Aetna initially paid for his treatments after each infusion, which can cost up to $20,000. But when Washington's clinic asked Aetna to pre-authorize a November 2014 infusion, Aetna says it was obligated to review his medical record. That's when it saw his last blood work had been done three years earlier for Kaiser.

Despite being told by his own doctor's office that he needed to come in for new blood work, Washington failed to do so for several months until he got so sick he ended up in the hospital with a collapsed lung.

Once his blood was tested, Aetna resumed covering his infusions and pre-certified him for a year. Despite that, according to Aetna, Washington continued to miss infusions.

Washington's suit counters that Aetna ignored his treating physician, who appealed on his behalf months before his hospitalization that the treatment was medically necessary ""to prevent acute and long-term problems.""

""Aetna is blaming me for what happened,"" Washington told CNN. ""I'll just be honest, it's infuriating to me. I want Aetna to be made to change.""

During his videotaped deposition in October 2016, Iinuma -- who signed the pre-authorization denial -- said he never read Washington's medical records and knew next to nothing about his disorder.

Intravenous immunoglobulin can cost as much as $20,000 per treatment. It helps patients like Gillen Washington stave off infection.

Questioned about Washington's condition, Iinuma said he wasn't sure what the drug of choice would be for people who suffer from his condition.

Iinuma further says he's not sure what the symptoms are for the disorder or what might happen if treatment is suddenly stopped for a patient.

""Do I know what happens?"" the doctor said. ""Again, I'm not sure. ... I don't treat it.""

Iinuma said he never looked at a patient's medical records while at Aetna. He says that was Aetna protocol and that he based his decision off ""pertinent information"" provided to him by a nurse.

""Did you ever look at medical records?"" Scott Glovsky, Washington's attorney, asked Iinuma in the deposition.

""No, I did not,"" the doctor says, shaking his head.

""So as part of your custom and practice in making decisions, you would rely on what the nurse had prepared for you?"" Glovsky asks.

""Correct.""

Iinuma said nearly all of his work was conducted online. Once in a while, he said, he might place a phone call to the nurse for more details.

How many times might he call a nurse over the course of a month?

""Zero to one,"" he said.

Glovsky told CNN he had ""never heard such explosive testimony in two decades of deposing insurance company review doctors.""

Aetna's response

Aetna defended Iinuma, who is no longer with the company, saying in its legal brief that he relied on his ""years of experience"" as a trained physician in making his decision about Washington's treatment and that he was following Aetna's Clinical Policy Bulletin appropriately.

""Dr. Iinuma's decision was correct,"" Aetna said in court papers. ""Plaintiff has asserted throughout this litigation that Dr. Iinuma had no medical basis for his decision that 2011 lab tests were outdated and that Dr. Iinuma's decision was incorrect. Plaintiff is wrong on both counts.""

Gillen Washington receives an infusion of the medicine needed to boost his immune system. He calls it ""the magic juice.""

In its trial brief, Aetna said: ""Given that Aetna does not directly provide medical care to its members, Aetna needs to obtain medical records from members and their doctors to evaluate whether services are 'medically necessary.' Aetna employs nurses to gather the medical records and coordinate with the offices of treating physicians, and Aetna employs doctors to make the actual coverage-related determinations.

""In addition to applying their clinical judgment, the Aetna doctors and nurses use Aetna's Clinical Policy Bulletins ('CPBs') to determine what medical records to request, and whether those records satisfy medical necessity criteria to support coverage. These CPBs reflect the current standard of care in the medical community. They are frequently updated, and are publicly available for any treating physician to review.""

Jones, the California insurance commissioner, said he couldn't comment specifically on Washington's case, but what drew his interest was the medical director's admission of not looking at patients' medical records.

""What I'm responding to is the portion of his deposition transcript in which he said as the medical director, he wasn't actually reviewing medical records,"" Jones told CNN.

He said his investigation will review every individual denial of coverage or pre-authorization during the medical director's tenure to determine ""whether it was appropriate or not for that decision to be made by someone other than a physician.""

If the probe determines that violations occurred, he said, California insurance code sets monetary penalties for each individual violation.

CNN has made numerous phone calls to Iinuma's office for comment but has not heard back. Heather Richardson, an attorney representing Aetna, declined to answer any questions.

Asked about the California investigation, Aetna gave this written statement to CNN:

""We have yet to hear from Commissioner Jones but look forward to explaining our clinical review process.

""Aetna medical directors are trained to review all available medical information -- including medical records -- to make an informed decision. As part of our review process, medical directors are provided all submitted medical records, and also receive a case synopsis and review performed by a nurse.

""Medical directors -- and all of our clinicians -- take their duties and responsibilities as medical professionals incredibly seriously. Similar to most other clinical environments, our medical directors work collaboratively with our nurses who are involved in these cases and factor in their input as part of the decision-making process.""

Gillen Washington became emaciated and gravely ill after four months without treatment.

'A huge admission'

Dr. Arthur Caplan, founding director of the division of medical ethics at New York University Langone Medical Center, described Iinuma's testimony as ""a huge admission of fundamental immorality.""

""People desperate for care expect at least a fair review by the payer. This reeks of indifference to patients,"" Caplan said, adding the testimony shows there ""needs to be more transparency and accountability"" from private, for-profit insurers in making these decisions.

Murphy, the former American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology board member, said he was ""shocked"" and ""flabbergasted"" by the medical director's admission.

""This is something that all of us have long suspected, but to actually have an Aetna medical director admit he hasn't even looked at medical records, that's not good,"" said Murphy, who runs an allergy and immunology practice west of Philadelphia.

""If he has not looked at medical records or engaged the prescribing physician in a conversation -- and decisions were made without that input -- then yeah, you'd have to question every single case he reviewed.""

Murphy said when he and other doctors seek a much-needed treatment for a patient, they expect the medical director of an insurance company to have considered every possible factor when deciding on the best option for care.

222,222,2018-05-13 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Portland, Oregon (CNN) All Erika Zak wants to do is play with her daughter on the playground. Take her to the zoo. Walk her to school.

She's never been able to be the mother she longs to be.

At 38, Erika is dying.

Her battle to live began almost as soon as her daughter, Loïe, was born four years ago, when Erika was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic colon cancer that had spread to her liver.

The cancer was removed from her colon and, her doctors say, she responded well to treatment. But a microwave ablation surgery last year to remove two tumors from her liver went terribly wrong, leaving a fist-sized hole in her liver and destroying her bile ducts.

Every day since has been a fight to survive. She's been hospitalized 19 times in Oregon over the last 12 months for infections, bleeding and an array of other health issues.

She has high blood pressure in her liver, which backs up the veins in her esophagus and can be catastrophic. Her surgical oncologist constantly worries she will fall ill with a bad infection and die.

Without a liver transplant, her doctors say Erika will likely die before the end of the year.

""Every time she calls me and has a fever and some bleeding, we all hold our breath, worried: Will this be the time Erika bleeds to death?"" says Dr. Skye Mayo, her surgical oncologist at Oregon Health & Science University.

""This is kind of the end game of what liver failure looks like.""

More than 100 doctors at three of the nation's top medical centers have weighed in on her case, which is complex and exceedingly rare. Their conclusion: The only way to save Erika's life is to give her a new liver.

After weeks of evaluation at the Cleveland Clinic in December and January, Erika finally got her big break.

On February 2, doctors there approved putting her on the wait list for a liver transplant.

The news changed everything. Erika finally had hope. Around the house, 4-year-old Loïe would say, ""Mommy, when you get a new liver, can you push me in the swing?""

But Erika hit an immediate wall. Her insurer, UnitedHealthcare, denied coverage for the transplant, saying it would not be a ""promising treatment."" She appealed and was rejected again.

The mom who desperately wanted to live looked into Oregon's Death with Dignity program. Erika had written a letter to her daughter months ago to be read after she died. Now she worried Loïe might receive it sooner than Mom had planned:

Dear Loïe,

If you're reading this, I'm probably not on this earth anymore. So please remember this:

I am with you always; even if you can no longer see my face or feel my hands through your hair. I am with you when you look up to the sky and see tiny birds flying free or the stars twinkling in your eyes. I am with you when you feel a perfect, warm breeze upon your sweet face.

Erika wasn't going to give up. Her little girl with bright blue eyes was a constant reminder of all that is precious.

Outraged and heartbroken, Erika wrote a four-page letter to the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare (UHC), giving him a piece of her mind about what she felt was a rigged review process, riddled with errors, that determined her life wasn't worth saving.

Weeks passed until the company reached a decision. Despite her plea, the answer was the same: Denied.

Then, last week, an amazing thing happened.

Erika Zak and her husband, Scott Powers, lock hands during a recent hospital visit. The two met 20 years ago.

'My life hangs in the balance'

If it's true that opening your heart, revealing your feelings, unleashes freedom and makes you whole, Erika turned to one of the things she loves most in an effort to save her life. Writing.

It was early April. She sat at her computer, her keyboard clacking. She wasn't going to leave her husband, Scott Powers, and their daughter Loïe behind without trying her damnedest to stay on this Earth for as long as possible.

There was too much at stake.

UnitedHealthcare had overruled her treating physicians and denied the transplant, saying ""unproven health services is not a covered benefit."" The words burned, like chemo. Her first appeal went nowhere, and she felt trapped in a labyrinth of red tape.

The young mother -- frail from having lost 20 pounds in the past year, her skin and eyes yellow from jaundice -- felt the only way to get a new liver was to plead her case directly to the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, David Wichmann.

Her frame may be tiny, but don't mistake that for weakness. She is one of the strongest women you will ever meet.

As she typed, Erika bared her soul. Of longing to live. Of seeing her daughter grow up. Of the need for ""my only option,"" a liver transplant.

""Given that my life hangs in the balance based on this review,"" she wrote, ""it is unconscionable that it has not been undertaken with the level of competence and professionalism anyone would expect of UHC.""

She blasted what she called the ""shockingly incompetent manner"" in which the country's largest insurance company handled her case. She outlined what she described as a series of errors made in the review process -- ranging from UHC saying her liver failure stems from ""chemotherapy toxicity"" to an insurance medical director who erroneously said she had ""life-threatening lesions.""

""Neither are true,"" she wrote Wichmann. ""(UHC's) handling of my case has been plagued by unnecessary delays, incomplete responses, inept scheduling, contradictory statements, and worst of all repeated factual errors regarding my medical history.

""Most importantly, decisions based on inaccurate information and analysis have already delayed my listing and transplant two months.""

Loie has been with her mother throughout the process. Erika calls her ""my tiniest, most amazing companion.""

One review doctor noted she had a ""9cm tumor"" in her liver, she wrote, apparently unaware that was actually the hole from the ablation surgery resulting in her chronic liver failure.

""I have been doing every single thing I possibly can do to stay alive for these past four years, scratching and clawing by day and praying every night an opportunity like this would come along,"" Erika wrote. ""Now, when the promise of my long-term survival is actually greatest, I need UHC's support more than ever.""

She sent the letter via FedEx on April 11.

Her concerns were valid. Her transplant team at the Cleveland Clinic made clear to UHC's appeals unit the primary cause of her liver failure was not from chemo toxicity or cancer, but instead was the result of ""a consequence of complications following microwave ablation.""

""Of note, what mainly drives the indication of liver transplantation in this case is liver failure and NOT liver metastases from colorectal cancer, which makes the patient's post-transplant oncologic outcome more encouraging,"" wrote Dr. Federico Aucejo, the director of the Cleveland Clinic's Liver Cancer Program, in an appeal on Erika's behalf on March 6. He did note that she had some chemotoxicity, which was a secondary cause of liver failure.

""The opinion of the experienced Cleveland Clinic multidisciplinary liver transplant committee (is) that liver transplantation would prolong this young patient's life substantially, and that there is NO other treatment alternative that could match this outcome at this point in time.""

Two days after sending her letter, Erika and her husband were told the UHC executive team had received it and that her case was undergoing further review.

Several times, the family said it was told a decision would be made by a certain date; those dates came and went without a decision.

As time wore on, Erika grew ill with a high fever and was hospitalized for several days. It was the fifth time she'd been admitted since February 2, the day Cleveland Clinic doctors approved her for a transplant.

On Instagram, she posted an illustration with the words ""waiting, waiting, waiting"" on a pink backdrop with black crosses.

""Waiting for insurance to approve the only thing that will save me: a liver,"" she wrote. ""Waiting for my liver to fail completely; waiting to die. Waiting to be saved.""

Erika has undergone multiple surgeries and faced more than 70 rounds of chemotherapy.

'Wait or die'

More than 100,000 Americans are on wait lists for organ transplants, and every hour someone dies while waiting for the life-saving surgery, said Dr. Andrew Cameron, the chief of transplant surgery at Johns Hopkins and the surgical director of its liver transplant program.

For liver transplants, 20,000 Americans are on the wait list and only 7,000 will receive a new liver in 2018, according to Cameron, who is not connected to Erika's case.

""The lucky few undergo a transformative life-saving procedure,"" he said. ""Those who don't get that lottery ticket wait or die.""

Transplant teams at hospitals spend hours upon hours -- months even -- assessing and debating whether a patient is a good candidate for a transplant, Cameron said, typically with more than a dozen doctors weighing in.

It is deeply disturbing, he said, when an insurance company overrules the ""decision made by a thoughtful, careful transplant team to utilize one of society's limited resources -- that precious gift to save somebody's life.""

The negotiated cost for a liver transplant for an insurance company is roughly $200,000, Cameron said, adding it is ""exceedingly rare"" for an insurer to deny a transplant.

""That is highly unusual and highly undesirable,"" Cameron told CNN.

In Cleveland, Dr. Aucejo is trailblazing the field for patients like Erika, having performed the only two transplants in America this century on people suffering from what is called unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer.

It's groundbreaking and could prove transformative.

""I hope that we can achieve good results and set precedent,"" he said.

Dr. Skye Mayo, a surgical oncologist at Oregon Health & Science University, has treated Erika Zak since 2015.

When you're trying such a new approach, Dr. Aucejo said, it can be difficult getting insurers to agree to treatment and he wished getting them aboard could be done ""in a more expeditious way.""

He explained that in the late 1980s and 1990s, surgeons tried transplants on patients like Erika with ""unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer,"" but the ""outcomes were not good.""

Only 18% of the patients lived past five years, so the transplants were stopped, Dr. Aucejo said. But, he emphasized, most of the bad outcomes were the result of technical complications and post-transplant management, not from the cancer returning. The field of transplants has greatly improved in the decades since, he said.

Doctors in Europe, primarily in Norway, have begun changing the field, he said, finding that about 50-60% of patients with Erika's condition survive a transplant past five years.

That is a substantial difference, he said.

Dr. Mayo, Erika's surgical oncologist in Oregon, said no one at the insurance company reached out to him during the review process ""to help explain the facts of her case.""

That is troubling, he said, especially when it's one of the most complicated cases a doctor will ever see.

""It is frustrating when it seems that the facts aren't all being considered,"" Dr. Mayo said.

""Her life now is not limited by her cancer,"" he said. ""It's limited by the fact she will go into liver failure and die within the next several months if she doesn't have a liver transplant.""

Erika wrote a note for her daughter if she does not survive: ""I am with you always; even if you can no longer see my face or feel my hands through your hair.""

When opposites attract

Erika was in the prime of her life. At 34, she'd given birth to her first and only child, Loïe, the little girl who Mom calls ""my tiniest, most amazing companion.""

She'd been married to the love of her life for four years. She and Scott met in 1998 when he was at Brown University and she was at the Rhode Island School of Design, both in Providence.

The two were polar opposites. He was the MVP of Brown's soccer team and majored in economics. She was into the arts and majored in textile design. He was from the tightly wound East Coast, she from the free-wheeling West Coast.

The connection wasn't immediate, so Erika had a mutual friend slip a tiny drawing to Scott. It contained her phone number; he called it.

Soon they clicked. Scott made her laugh and feel beautiful. Erika saw in him someone who was kind and devoted; in her, he found the woman who he'd always searched for, with a captivating sense of humor and a sailor's mouth.

They tied the knot on Halloween in 2009 in the wine country of Healdsburg, California.

Her career was taking off, too. She was working for Old Navy, choosing and designing the fabrics, prints and plaids for the company's baby and toddler division. While she was pregnant, she was promoted to senior textile designer.

""It was all coming together,"" she wrote on her blog. ""And then, like that, my foundation crumbled.""

During the final trimester of her pregnancy, she'd experienced pain in her stomach. It was thought to be nothing more than part of the difficulties of pregnancy. But in the weeks after delivery, the pain grew excruciating and she felt a lump on her side.

On April 8, 2014, she received the awful news -- that she had stage 4 metastatic colon cancer that had spread to her liver. Her daughter was just 3 months old.

""Worst Day Ever"" read the headline of her blog.

She had survived cancer once before. At 28, she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Her thyroid was removed, and life continued as normal. It was nothing close to a stage 4 diagnosis.

In the years after her colon cancer diagnosis, she blogged about most everything. Of losing her father to Alzheimer's at age 83. Of the pain over two friends' deaths -- including an oncologist she'd met in a cancer support group.

""Have you ever cried and screamed so hard that the blood vessels around your eyes burst?"" she wrote.

In her blog posts, she was brutally honest about her cancer and the effects of chemotherapy.

Erika and Scott Powers met in college while they were both in school in Rhode Island.

She'd sit on the shower floor in a fetal position, screaming and sobbing. It was ""anguish and pain and longing for my former life and utter disbelief for the war my body was waging on itself,"" she blogged.

Her fingertips felt like they had been ""burned on a hot pan most of the time."" Her hands cramped into weird, contorted positions. Her hair was dry and brittle, like straw. Her energy was so drained she felt twice her age.

As a teen, she'd suffered debilitating depression and anxiety that was so bad at times, she said, ""I hoped that I could just disappear forever.""

""It's funny how afraid I am of that now: disappearing. How much I want to live. How important it feels to be here,"" she wrote on December 1, 2016, two and half years into her cancer battle.

She would face multiple surgeries and undergo more than 70 rounds of chemo. On February 28, 2017, she wrote:

""This is chemo day. Scream in your pillow day. Hide in the shower day. Lie to your baby day. Tell her you're going to work day. Vials and vials of blood day. Tell your doctor you're angry day. Make your husband cry day. Poison your body day.""

On another day, she penned: ""Cancer is a slow form of torture. It strips you of dignity; of peace of mind; of stability.""

On April 4, 2017, nearly three years to the day of her diagnosis, she and her daughter had a soul-crushing conversation. The cancer had been eradicated from her colon shortly after the diagnosis, but it remained in her liver.

""Mommy, are you going to last?"" Loïe asked.

""What do you mean, Loïe?""

""Will you be here forever and ever?"" the girl asked.

""I really don't know, babe.""

As she awaited word from her insurer about the transplant, Erika said, ""I'm mad and grouchy, but I still feel like I have a fighting chance.""

Six days later, Erika underwent the ablation surgery at a facility in New York to target two small tumors on her liver. Something went wrong. She ended up with the hole in her liver.

To save her life, surgeons had to block off the veins and arteries going to her liver. The entire central part of her liver died, Dr. Mayo said. Two bags are now attached to her abdomen to drain the bile.

With bile going immediately outside her body, instead of through the liver and her body, Erika was susceptible to extreme sickness and potential fatal bleeds.

""All of those things culminated in what is now liver failure for her,"" Dr. Mayo said. ""She's in this cycle right now where she's losing on a daily basis some of her body's most vital fluids.""

The cancer in her liver, meanwhile, was progressing on a path, he said, where ""she would die of cancer."" She could no longer tolerate any standard form of chemo treatment.

Her doctors in Oregon last fall tried one last treatment to fend off her cancer: a groundbreaking immunotherapy cancer drug called pembrolizumab, known by its brand name Keytruda.

Her sky-high tumor marker levels fell to normal. ""She had an incredible response to this new drug,"" Dr. Mayo said. ""I think all of the cancer remaining in her body is dead at this point. What she will die of is liver failure.""

With a new liver, he said, her problems with bleeding and high blood pressure could be resolved. Her jaundice would be gone, too.

But transplant surgery is not without major risks.

Most of those who've received a transplant with unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer, Cleveland's Dr. Aucejo said, experience a recurrence of cancer within 12 months.

Most of the cancers that return can be treated with standard care, like chemotherapy or surgery, he said, profoundly prolonging their lives.

For a small subset of patients, though, the cancer comes back aggressively and it's not treatable with chemo or surgery, he said. ""Unfortunately in that subset of patients, the survival is more dismal.""

While it's impossible to predict the outcome, he said, Erika shows ""features that may do well."" There's no evidence cancer has spread beyond her liver, he said.

Plus, patients who had their colon cancer removed two years or more before the transplant, Dr. Aucejo said, tend do well. Erika had the cancerous portion of her colon removed in 2014: ""That's a good indicator.""

Dr. Aucejo also emphasized the criteria for transplant qualification is stringent and that Erika shows promise.

""We're talking about distributing limited organs,"" he said. ""Again, we have to be very careful that we're not giving organs to people who are not going to benefit from it when there's people dying with standard indications because there's not enough organs.""

Erika Zak comes to the hospital every three weeks for a groundbreaking immunotherapy drug. Her doctors says that without it, she would have died of cancer.

'This is so messed up'

In the days and weeks after Erika fired off her letter to the CEO, her husband, Scott, worked the phones.

He felt lost in an endless loop of delays and broken promises as to when the insurer would reach its decision.

Finally, they were told a decision would come May 2.

Erika couldn't sleep the night before. She pulled out her phone and recorded a message, weeping for much of the video.

""My life is literally in their hands, and every day I feel myself kind of fading away more and more,"" she says. ""I don't want to leave. I don't want to die.""

The next day came. Each minute crept by.

Shortly after 2 p.m., Scott's phone rang.

It was their point of contact with UnitedHealthcare.

He had crushing news: Denied.

He explained Erika's case was sent back to the three reviewing doctors. One of them, he said, ""changed his decision from 'not promising' to 'promising.'""

However, the other two doctors ruled the transplant not to be promising: ""The bottom line is they're upholding that decision.""

The doctor who sided in favor of the transplant, their UHC contact told them, was the only one of the three who talked directly with her transplant surgeon.

Scott grew furious. ""Honestly, you know that is messed up,"" he said. ""I don't know who you've got to go to, but I would go to someone now and have someone call us, because this is so messed up.""

Scott Powers has advocated for his wife since she was first diagnosed with cancer.

Scott pressed for more information. He got little.

""Scott, I know what you've been through,"" the UHC rep told him. ""I know what you're going through.""

Erika sat silently for the first 10 minutes of the conservation, absorbing the news and what it meant for her fate. But at those words, it was time to speak up.

""Hey!"" she shouted. ""This is Erika, and you've never heard from me before. You don't know what we're going through. Because I'm dying.""

Through tears, she said, ""I need a liver transplant, and I need it now.""

The UHC rep confided he ""was not hoping for this outcome. I was hoping that I'd have good news.""

He suggested Erika and Scott fax over any new information they thought might be relevant. He also acknowledged the delays in recent weeks were not in keeping with the company's policies.

""Someone needs to be accountable for this,"" he said. ""You know, why, when we have these guidelines in place, did we not follow them?

""That needs to be looked into,"" he said, adding, ""I'm not trying to sweep anything under the rug.""

He apologized for having to be the bearer of bad news, saying his goal had been to end the day on a positive note.

""Like I said, I wish I had better news.""

After more than 30 minutes, he ended with: ""Have a good night, OK.""

Not the words the couple wanted to hear.

Erika went numb. Heartbroken and angry didn't even begin to describe her feelings.

Scott felt equally distraught. ""I just want her to get a liver,"" he said. ""She deserves that.""

The CEO never responded -- not by email, phone or letter.

Erika Zak says her will to live is motivated by her daughter, Loïe. Here, they play on the couch as the family dog, Maddie, watches.

A sudden change

Five days later, on Monday, May 7, a surprise call came. Erika and Scott were preparing Loïe for school when Scott's phone rang.

They had spent the weekend trying to figure out their next move, while trying not to focus too much on when Erika might need Death with Dignity. They knew they had one appeal left, and they didn't want to blow it.

They hadn't sent any new information since the last call.

It was their UHC rep on the phone. This time, he had good news: The insurer would cover Erika's transplant.

When Scott heard she'd been approved, he jumped up and down. Erika watched him from across the room.

There was no explanation for the change. They were told to focus on Erika's health and next steps.

Erika called her mother, who unleashed a guttural scream at work.

Loïe has grown excited at the prospect of her mother's transplant. Erika just wants to be able to walk her to school or take her to the playground.

Dr. Mayo was preparing for surgery when he took Scott's call. Elation spread across the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University where doctors, nurses and staff celebrated.

In Cleveland, Dr. Aucejo heard the welcome news from his transplant coordinator. He'd not spoken with anyone at UHC about the case in the five days since the previous denial.

""They had decided on their own. We hadn't gotten back to them,"" he said. ""I'm happy they ended up sharing our vision.""

I had been speaking with Erika and Scott for this story over the last month and had reviewed her medical records extensively. During the May 2 phone call in which Erika was told her transplant had been denied, Scott told the UHC rep that the couple had been speaking with a member of the national news media.

I was on a flight to Oregon when they received the joyous news. ""UHC just called and approved Erika. Unreal. Know you're in flight but call whenever,"" Scott texted.

When we met a couple hours later, Erika's emotions were still raw. She thought this would be her last Mother's Day. Now, suddenly, she has hope for more.

Glancing at her daughter and husband, Erika broke down in tears.

""I can't imagine not being here,"" she said. ""It's not because I keep the family together or anything. It's just the love I have for them.""

""Mommy, why are you crying?"" Loïe said.

""I'm crying because I love you.""

Loïe placed her fingers in her mother's right hand.

""Love you,"" Loïe said.

As she and Loïe locked hands, the tattoo on Erika's wrist displayed a fitting message: ""Be brave.""

During her cancer fight, Erika and her twin sister got matching tatoos with one message: ""Be brave.""

Epilogue

UnitedHealthcare declined to answer CNN's questions about the handling of Erika's case, except to issue this one-sentence statement:

""We had on-going conversations with her husband and contacted him as soon as the decision was made to approve the transplant request.""

Even after the approval, Erika said she still wanted to move forward with the story, to speak up for others who've experienced the pain of similar denials. To let them know they're not alone. To encourage them to be their own best advocates.

It can mean the difference between life and death.

""No one should have to fight and work that hard,"" she said, ""especially when I have all these doctors saying it will save my life.""

Since the approval, the family has been preparing to move to Cleveland for Erika's surgery and recovery at the Cleveland Clinic. Erika was officially notified Friday morning she was placed on the liver transplant wait list.

It's impossible to know how long the family will be in Cleveland or when the transplant will occur. Transplant candidates are given what is known as a ""MELD score,"" ranging from 6 to 40. Those closest to 40 are given the highest priority.

Erika's MELD score has hovered around 22. If her score is still in that range, Dr. Aucejo said, her transplant could be a few months away.

""But this varies a lot,"" he said. ""There are many variables at play here.""

A patient for a liver transplant, he said, is typically hospitalized 7 to 10 days for the procedure, with a recovery time of 4 to 8 weeks before the patient resumes normal activities.

Would Erika have had the transplant by now if the surgery had been approved in February?

Every day Erika says she can feel her body deteriorating. ""I don't want to die,"" she says.

""That is very speculative, at the least,"" Dr. Aucejo said. ""I couldn't say that.""

He chose his words carefully, saying it's a ""complex dynamic"" between hospitals and insurance companies and he doesn't want to upset that balance.

""She's been approved and that's what matters -- and hopefully we can move forward with her transplant.""

Dr. Aucejo said he can somewhat understand the insurance company's initial reluctance at coverage because the procedure is so rare for patients with Erika's condition.

""It's a new territory,"" he told CNN. ""I can't blame anybody.""

If Erika receives her transplant and succeeds, Dr. Aucejo said, she could help set precedent for many others down the road.

(CNN) I talk about suicide every day. I've seen suicide from more angles than I'd wish on anyone: I've lost friends to suicide, seen the immediate aftermath of a suicide death, and survived two of my own suicide attempts. In the years after my most recent attempt in 2006, it felt like I was alone in what I'd been through. I didn't know anyone else who was open about having attempted suicide and lived; all I could find online were statistics, and a handful of anonymous stories wrapped with happy endings like neat little bows. They lacked the warmth of human idiosyncrasy. I couldn't connect.

Thanks to a long history of prejudice, there's a culture of silence around disclosure of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. No one wants to be kicked out of college discharged from the military or fired from a job for speaking the truth or asking for help. These are real consequences faced by real people every day. The culture of silence prevails, and it's got to stop.

Attempt survivors have a lot to teach us about suicide. But we have to be there to listen.

In 2010, I started interviewing and photographing attempt survivors as part of a series called "" Live Through This. "" I wanted to give them a platform to talk openly and honestly about their experiences with suicidality -- the messiness of the ride, the struggle, the resilience -- as a way to reclaim their narratives in a public space, using their names and likenesses with pride. No more silence. No more hiding.

Statistics paint us a generalizable picture of the population affected by suicide -- rates are highest among white men of middle age and beyond 40% of transgender folks attempt suicide in their lifetime, etc. -- but we often get lost in the statistics. We forget that suicide is a deeply complex, deeply personal issue, unique to every person it affects.

I've interviewed and photographed 185 suicide attempt survivors in 36 US cities. They range in age from 19 to 69, with different upbringings, sexual orientations and gender presentations, and a variety of trauma experiences. They come from different socioeconomic, professional, racial and religious backgrounds. Suicide doesn't care who you are. Like little else in this world, it doesn't discriminate.

According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released recently, 54% of those who died by suicide in the United States between 1999 and 2016 did not have a known mental health diagnosis, which indicates that systemic issues and devastating life events play a more impactful role in suicidal despair than we've previously acknowledged. We can't keep looking at suicide through the myopic lens of mental health. Suicide is a complex issue. Linking it solely to mental health is reductive and doesn't tell the whole story. It's a much larger public health issue, with a PR problem. We need to connect in order to care. The overwhelming majority of those already engaged in the conversation have previously been affected by suicide in some way; everyone else is disengaged and disinterested.

In the past, we've seen taboo subjects destigmatized when more people began to talk about them. Women in the 1950s were both embarrassed of and afraid to talk about the lumps in their breasts that threatened their lives, but a wave of feminist-powered activism in the 1970s changed everything. One by one, women spoke up. One by one, their communities listened. Now, we no longer fear saying the ""C"" word out loud. Hundreds of millions of dollars in federal research funding are earmarked for breast cancer annually. Support groups are available and encouraged for those affected. Every October, we're awash in a sea of pink ribbons, worn by those currently suffering, those who survived and those who support them. Rates of death attributed to breast cancer have been decreasing since 1989.

Suicide rates have been rising steadily since 1999. We need a similar sea change in suicide prevention.

Finish two points ahead of Fiji with Paris win

Paris, France (CNN) After six months, ten tournaments and over 2,700 tries, the men's Sevens World Series title was decided by the final game in Paris.

South Africa, who went into the tournament seven points adrift of Fiji, faced England in the last match of the season knowing a win would see them take the spoils.

In a rain-soaked Stade Jean-Bouin on Sunday, the Blitzboks duly delivered -- winning the Cup Final 24-14 and successfully defending their championship crown.

It was a cruel blow for Fiji, who suffered a shock defeat to England in the quarterfinals and had to watch on in Paris as their Series lead slipped away, despite having won five of the previous six tournaments.

225,225,2018-05-18 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Traveling can wreak havoc on our diets, but packing a nutritious snack or meal before heading out the door can get us started on the right healthy eating track and perhaps give us a bit of wiggle room for indulgences before arriving at our destination.

But what travel foods are the most munch-worthy? To find out, I asked 10 nutritionists for their favorite snacks or meals when traveling by road or air. Below, their responses.

Nut butter and jam sandwich

""Individual containers having no more than 3 ounces of liquids or gels are allowed through security -- and this restriction applies to yogurt, peanut butter, hummus, jam and apple sauce. However, sandwiches are acceptable. I travel with a sandwich made with toasted (prevents sogginess) sprouted whole-grain bread, natural nut butter and an all-fruit jam because it does not need refrigeration and provides a good balance of protein, carbohydrates, fat, fiber, vitamins and minerals. Toss it in a Ziploc bag with baby carrots, and you're good to go. If you are a grazer, deconstruct the sandwich and bring along unsalted dry-roasted nuts, unsulphured dried fruit (or a banana) and rice cakes."" -- Layne Lieberman , registered dietitian nutritionist, author of "" Beyond the Mediterranean Diet: European Secrets of the Super-Healthy

Homemade trail mix

""I always make my own trail mix to take with my during my travels. I roast several varieties of nuts, bake granola in the oven with some honey and add dried fruit, whole-grain cereals and maybe a few pieces of chocolate. It is great because I can change it up every time and I know the ingredients, portion size and all of the calories associated with it. (A lot of store-bought trail mix can have tons of added sugar, oil and calories.) It's also balanced with carbohydrates, protein and fat, so I know it will help me feel and stay full. You can pack some extra in your checked luggage if it is a long trip."" -- Wesley Delbridge , registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics

Kind nuts & spices bars

""While I'm not much for bars as a day-to-day staple, I think bars are made for traveling; they're so convenient and easy to carry. The Kind nuts & spices bars have about 200 calories, so it's a pretty substantial snack and is mostly made up of satisfying protein, fiber and healthy fats from nuts. They've got only 5 grams (about 1 teaspoon) of sugar, which easily fits into my daily budget. Because I have celiac disease, I also need snacks that are reliably gluten-free, and this can be hard to find on the road. The Kind bars are really easy to find; many coffee shops carry them, and every airport sells them, so I always know I can find something healthy and suitable to eat if travel finds me at the airport and starving in between meals."" -- Tamara Duker Freuman , New York City-based registered dietitian

Frittata muffins

""My favorite travel meal is homemade spinach, red pepper and cheese frittata muffins. Simply make a frittata using a muffin tin so you have egg muffins to grab-'n'-go. Eggs provide high-quality protein, which fills us up and improves our mood. Being in a good mood is important, as traveling can be stressful. Adding the veggies to the mix gives additional vitamins, minerals, nutrients and fiber for a well-balanced, colorful mini-meal. The frittatas should be eaten within two hours or packed in an insulated lunch bag with ice."" -- Sarah Koszyk , registered dietitian, sports nutritionist, author of "" 365 Snacks for Every Day of the Year

Oatmeal

""One food that is always in my carry-on travel bag is oatmeal. I either toss in oatmeal packets or the new oatmeal kits that are all-in-one, perfectly balanced meals on the go. With an oatmeal packet, all you have to do is ask the flight attendant or coffee barista for hot water. Simply stir your oatmeal into the hot water and let it sit until thickened. You can grab cinnamon, honey and brown sugar that is available at all coffee shops, and eat. I often throw in a few almonds or walnuts that I have on hand to make a balanced meal. With the new oatmeal kits like Wild Friends , the cup and the peanut butter are provided. ... All I need is hot water, and I'm ready to eat a healthy meal that will keep me from eating unhealthy fast food, and full for the next three hours!"" -- Amy Shapiro, registered dietitian and founder of Real Nutrition , a nutritional counseling and weight management practice in New York

Crispy roasted chickpeas

""After having one too many achy stomach grumbling experiences traveling without food, you'll now always find a tasty snack in my carry-on that's a good source of plant-based protein and fiber; it's a particularly satisfying duo. That's exactly what you'll find in these Saffron Road crunchy chickpeas (vs. munchie chickpeas); it's one of my favorite travel-worthy picks. With so many varieties to choose from, I can always find one that suits whatever flavor mood I'm in.

""A simple way to make your own roasted chickpeas is to toss canned, drained chickpeas with olive oil and seasonings of choice, then bake in a 425-degree oven for about 25 to 30 minutes."" -- Jackie Newgent , registered dietitian nutritionist, private cooking coach, author of "" The All-Natural Diabetes Cookbook

Amrita's high-protein bars

Miso soup

""I love miso soup because it's hot and satisfying. The strong umami taste is perfect for blunted taste buds during travel. And soups provide a sense of fullness and satiety in a modest package. I look for all natural and organic brands that have tofu for a bit of protein, and seaweed, which is a rich source of minerals, including calcium, magnesium and iron. You can find miso soup 'packets' that are slim for travel; you just need to ask the flight attendant for a warm beverage cup and hot water.""-- Kate Geagan , registered dietitian, author of "" Go Green, Get Lean

Homemade granola bars

""My favorite snacks for travel are my homemade granola bars because they are packed with fiber, protein and healthy fats, keeping me satisfied until I get off the plane. I use the same formula with oats, nuts, seeds and dried fruit but change up the flavors based on the time of year. For instance, I love my gingerbread granola bars for the colder months but might swap the ginger for cocoa powder or cinnamon now that the weather is getting warmer."" -- Kara Lydon, registered dietitian, intuitive eating counselor and blogger at The Foodie Dietitian

There is no such thing as ""spot reducing"" when it comes to fat loss

(CNN) If you ask almost any fitness professional how to lose your love handles, they will tell you two things: No amount of abdominal crunches will make a difference if you don't first improve your diet and exercise regimen.

And there is no such thing as ""spot reducing"" when it comes to fat loss, so you can't target this area alone.

Love handles, the pinchable fat on both sides of your stomach that leads to a ""muffin top"" appearance, are especially stubborn. They do not respond as quickly to diet and exercise changes as the more dangerous visceral fat that is deep within your abdomen and leads to more of a ""potbelly"" appearance.

If you are a woman and your waist is larger than 35 inches around or a man with a waist size greater than 40 inches, you will lose the deep belly fat first. This is actually better for your health, as visceral fat has been linked to numerous medical issues, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, pre-diabetes and inflammation.

To lose the subcutaneous fat that forms not-so-lovable love handles (or excess fat on your hips, thighs and buttocks), it's going to take even more time and effort.

228,228,2018-06-21 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Jerusalem (CNN) The wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was charged with fraud and breach of trust Thursday over the alleged misuse of state funds at the couple's official residence.

In a case known as the ""Meals Ordering Affair,"" prosecutors say Sara Netanyahu used state money to pay for $100,000 worth of meals at the prime minister's residence, according to an indictment filed in Jerusalem's magistrate's court on Thursday.

Sara Netanyahu also illegally paid approximately $10,000 for private chefs, prosecutors said.

The charges carry a maximum sentence of 8 years in prison.

Her lawyers slammed the indictment, describing it as ""false and hallucinatory"".

""It's the first time in Israel and in the world that the wife of a leader is put on trial for food entrees,"" her legal team said in a statement. ""There was no fraud, no breach of trust or any other felony. The food was not for the Netnayahu family, but for other people, including workers in the residence. We're certain in the end that justice will speak. Truth and logic will prevail.""

The indictment is a blow to an embattled power couple already facing several other criminal investigations. Benjamin Netanyahu has been named a suspect in two separate criminal investigations and was questioned as a suspect in a third. Police say they have enough evidence to indict the Israeli leader on charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust in those cases.

From April 2009 until March 2013, Sara Netanyahu ordered meals from some of the most expensive restaurants in Jerusalem, according to the indictment, which painstakingly detailed each transaction by month. In December 2011, prosecutors say she ordered meals to the prime minister's residence totaling 24,164 shekels -- more than $6,500 dollars. Just a few months later in April 2012, the family ordered meals amounting to 26,061 shekels -- more than $7,100.

Under Israeli law, if there is no cook in the prime minister's residence, it is permissible to order prepared food. But prosecutors say the Netanyahu family had a cook in the house and yet still ordered the food, with Israeli taxpayers footing the bill.

Sara Netanyahu also used state funds to pay waiters to serve the meals on weekends and during private events, according to prosecutors, who said the hand-picked waiters were registered as ""extra manpower"" or ""cleaners"" to hide the fact that they were being illegally employed.

Prosecutors allege that Sara Netanyahu submitted claims ""knowing that the claims were not true, believing they were not true, and through these claims, they have received goods by fraud."" Prosecutors pointed to the ""severity of the circumstances,"" citing the ""sum of money, the planned, continuous, and systemic action, the character of the false presentations, and the carrying out of those deeds in the official residence of the Prime Minister.""

Prosecutors also charged the former Deputy Director-General of the Prime Minister's Office, Ezra Saidoff, with fraud and breach of trust. Prosecutors say he coordinated with Sara Netanyahu, managing the meal payments and invoices to conceal them from oversight. He was also charged with forgery.

A lawyer for Saidoff, Yehoshua Reznik, insisted Saidoff had done nothing wrong. ""Mr. Saidoff acted with integrity and according to the law in all his actions and were done in coordination with all of the relevant parties in the office. The submission of the indictment sheet against Mr. Saidoff is fundamentally wrong and does not coincide with the factual and judicial situation as it appears from the evidence in the case,"" Reznik said.

The latest developments increase the pressure on the Prime Minister, who has already faced numerous calls from opposition politicians to resign. Like his wife, Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence, decrying the investigations as a ""witch hunt"" and saying ""there will be nothing because there is nothing.""

Netanyahu has insisted he will not step down as Prime Minister, though an indictment against him would likely lead to his government coalition partners forcing him out.","Sara Netanyahu, wife of Israeli PM, charged with fraud",http://cnn.com/2018/06/21/middleeast/sara-netanyahu-indicted-intl/index.html
229,229,2018-05-22 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Germ-free childhoods followed by infections later in life can trigger the onset of childhood leukemia, a new study suggests.

The first step is a genetic mutation before birth that predisposes a child to the risk of developing this form of leukemia. The second step is exposure to certain infections later in childhood, after clean early childhoods that limited exposure to infections.

More specifically, children who grew up in cleaner households during their first year and interacted less with other children are more likely to develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the paper says.

The author, Institute of Cancer Research Professor Mel Greaves, suggests the cancer could be preventable.

Greaves reviewed more than 30 years of research, including his own, on the genetics, cell biology, immunology, epidemiology and animal modeling of childhood leukemia and reached this conclusion. Greaves said he had long wondered ""why or how otherwise healthy children develop leukaemia and whether this cancer is preventable.""

""This body of research is a culmination of decades of work, and at last provides a credible explanation for how the major type of childhood leukaemia develops,"" he said in a statement. ""The research strongly suggests that (this cancer) has a clear biological cause, and is triggered by a variety of infections in predisposed children whose immune systems have not been properly primed.""

However, other experts warn that more specifics needs to be confirmed and emphasize that hygiene and safety are still crucial.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia , known as ALL, is a form of blood cancer that is most often diagnosed in children ages zero to 4 years old, though older children and adults can also be diagnosed. It develops quickly, over days or weeks, building up in the blood and spreads to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, liver and nervous system. The main form of treatment is chemotherapy.

Rates of the disease are increasing globally. One study estimated there were 53,000 cases worldwide in 2016. Around 5,960 new cases of ALL are estimated to occur in the United States in 2018, with 1,470 deaths according to the American Cancer Society. Each year, around 810 people are diagnosed in the UK , according to Cancer Research UK.

While a genetic mutation plays a role in predisposing someone to the disease, just 1% of children born with this mutation go on to develop the disease, according to the paper. Rates are more common in advanced, affluent societies, which suggests the second step could be caused by factors relating to modern life.

Previous claims have linked electromagnetic waves and other environmental factors to the disease, but Greaves dismissed this link in his paper.

The body of research ""busts some persistent myths about the causes of leukaemia, such as the damaging but unsubstantiated claims that the disease is commonly caused by exposure to electro-magnetic waves or pollution,"" said Greaves.

Greaves instead believes that when a baby is exposed to infections during its first year, its immune system is strengthened. But later infections, without the initial priming, can trigger leukemia in those with the genetic mutation.

Population studies have found that early exposure to infection in infancy such as day care attendance and breastfeeding can protect against ALL, probably by priming the immune system, according to the study.

Greaves emphasized that infection as a cause applies only to ALL. Other types of leukemia, including infant leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, probably have different causal mechanisms.

""Preventing childhood leukaemia would have a huge impact on the lives of children and their families in the UK and across the globe,"" said Paul Workman, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, London.

However, other experts are more cautiously hopeful, emphasizing that genetics and pure chance are still significant factors for developing ALL.

""If we could stop this type of leukaemia from happening in the first place it would be enormously exciting, but many more questions still need to be answered in the research lab before we will know for sure whether that could become a reality,"" said Alasdair Rankin, director of research at blood cancer charity Bloodwise.

""There is no proven link yet with a specific infection,"" said Dr. Donna Lancaster, consultant pediatric oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. ""This [new study] still needs further investigation and any exposure of young children to infection has to be balanced with the risk of the infection.

Sheena Cruickshank of the British Society for Immunology also pointed to the potential risk of exposing children to infections, emphasizing that hygiene and safety are still crucial to maintain.

""It's also important to remember that infections themselves can pose a significant risk for young babies with a developing immune system,"" said Cruickshank in a statement. ""Parents should not be unduly alarmed by this review.""

The research may be a step toward developing preventative measures. However, Charles Swanton, chief clinician of Cancer Research UK, stressed that the causes and prevention methods are still unconfirmed.

""This research sheds light on how a form of childhood blood cancer might develop, implicating a complex combination of genetics and early exposure to germs, dirt, and illness,"" Swanton said. ""We want to assure any parents of a child who has or has had leukaemia, that there's nothing that we know of that could have been done to prevent their illness.""",Leukemia: Could germ-free childhoods could trigger illness?,http://cnn.com/2018/05/22/health/leukemia-clean-childhood-study-intl/index.html

(CNN) All of Europe is currently on hold -- and holding its breath. Business as usual is at a standstill, even though the EU is mired in its deepest crisis since its founding and other urgent matters, like a trade war with the US, are begging for redress.

Why?

Because the German state of Bavaria has a regional election scheduled for mid-October.

It may sound absurd -- and indeed it is -- but Bavaria's conservative party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), which has ruled in Bavaria since 1949, is panicked that it might lose the absolute majority in its southern German stronghold. Polls show it kilometers ahead of all of the opposition parties -- and thus a given to win and remain in office -- but this time around in need of a junior coalition partner, perhaps the Greens or the Liberals, to constitute a majority.

The CSU is in this unfamiliar but not-so-desperate position because Germany's own far right party, the xenophobic Alternative for Germany, or AfD, is cutting into its traditional constituencies. In the 2017 general election, the AfD, running for the first time nationally, took 10% of the Bavarian vote and the CSU dropped by 10%, capturing 39% of the vote.

In order to win back its stray sheep, the CSU has responded in exactly the wrong way, namely by loudly championing all of the far right's causes: anti-immigration, the security state, militarized EU borders, racial profiling, and Germany-first economics. The CSU, for example, objects to Germany giving even an inch in reforming the eurozone along the lines favored by French President Emmanuel Macron.

Just as Austria's conservatives in the 1990s foolheartedly played into the court of its far right, thus lending it legitimacy and voters, the CSU is throwing fuel on the fire in Germany. The more it apes the AfD, the larger the far-right party grows. Currently in the polls the AfD is at 13.5% in Bavaria and 16% nationally, all-time highs.

All of this would hardly matter to people beyond the Alps if the CSU were not a member of Merkel's shaky center-left government, the far right was not on the rise across Europe, and the EU was not at odds with itself. Moreover, the CSU's stubborn, demagogic campaign has given the Trump administration opportunity to effectively intervene in German politics on behalf of the far right, another step toward upending the postwar transatlantic alliance, until now the bedrock of Atlantic security since 1945.

Now, this does matter as it is a highly precarious, wholly unprecedented state of affairs, which could well unseat German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who looks weaker than ever before. That would leave Macron the lone heavyweight standing for liberal values in Europe.

In its lurch to the far right, the CSU has not been attacking the AfD, as one might expect, but rather Angela Merkel personally and the center-left government, of which it is part. The CSU's most vocal antagonist -- there are several in the chorus -- is Horst Seehofer , a lumbering, straight-faced bear of a man, who is Merkel's interior minister, as well as head of the CSU.

Topic number one in the nasty, public internecine wrangle between Merkel and the CSU is Germany's refugee policy, which the Bavarians have prioritized because the AfD and its hard-right European allies have. Merkel's detractors assert that Germany is being overrun with refugees of Islamic faith who pose a danger to the security of ordinary Germans and a threat to western civilization as such. This is the same line propagated by Central Europe's strongmen in office in Poland, Hungary, and Austria, as well as the Trump administration and now Italy too. (One difference, though, the CSU is not for Germany taking zero asylum seekers, but a limited number.)

In fact, Germany's intake of asylum seekers has plummeted since 2015, when nearly a million refugees, most fleeing Syria's war, arrived in an unprepared Germany. This year, less than 50,000 (as of April) have applied for political asylum, the reduced number a result of Merkel's imposition of ever stricter policies and other contingencies.

Thus, there is no refugee crisis in Germany as there is in countries such as Turkey , Pakistan and Lebanon where many millions of refugees reside. Italy and Greece are the European countries on the frontlines, but they're getting scant help from Germany or any other EU countries.

The dust-up in Germany thus is symbolic, although there's nothing figurative about the CSU's unswerving onslaught against Merkel since 2015. Seehofer's most recent bugbear is Germany's acceptance of refugees at its border who either don't have papers of any kind or who have already applied for political asylum in another country. Again, the numbers of such persons coming to Germany is really quite small, and Germany is, as every EU state is, required by international law to accept people fleeing political persecution.

Merkel and the rest of the German government insist on an all-EU solution to refugees and immigration -- as they have for years. Seehofer, Germany's interior minister, has audaciously tried to pressure Merkel, saying either she and the other EU nations devise a solution or he closes Bavaria's borders.

EU leaders have thus agreed to an emergency mini-summit in Brussels this weekend to throw Merkel a lifeline. The problem, however, is that most EU countries object to a proportional distribution of asylum applicants, which is Merkel's wish -- and rightly so. The numbers of refugees per country would be tiny if every EU country would take their share according to population size.

But no. And the Central Europeans aren't the only ones who dig in their heels.

Merkel's further option is to reassert the primacy of the EU's so-called Dublin II regulation for asylum applicants, which means that refugees can only apply for asylum in the EU country that they enter -- and then must remain there until a decision is made on their status.

Of course, this raises hackles in frontline states Greece and Italy, which feel swamped with refugees out of Africa and the Middle East. This completely unfair status quo is one of the explanations for Italy's far right coming to power there.

Another option is the creation of screening centers in northern Africa to process refugee claims before they arrive in Europe -- but the African nations object. Another proposal, clearly appealing to Europe's right wing, is more financing for securing EU's external borders to keep refugees from applying for asylum in the first place.

Seehofer and his CSU have staked everything on the issue, thus putting Merkel under extreme pressure. It's even conceivable that should Merkel fail to deliver, the CSU would pull out of the Berlin coalition and let the government fall. There are already murmurings about possible successors to Merkel.

The end of Merkel's tenure would not however solve anything. New elections would probably even boost the AfD, which is the prime mover behind the entire imbroglio in the first place.

(CNN) The Australian Prime Minister's move to ban relationships between ministers and their staffers brings politics in Canberra in line with corporate standards around the country.

The trigger was a scandal involving Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joy ce, whose 24-year marriage broke down last year around the same time he had an affair with a staff member, who is now pregnant with their baby.

While Turnbull's move is overdue to address the culture in Canberra, the early reaction seems to be that he has missed a significant aspect of why Joyce's actions were so concerning to the public.

That is, not the personal relationship itself with a staffer, but the subsequent wheeling and dealing which saw Joyce's mistress handed plum jobs in other offices, alongside Joyce receiving rent-free accommodation from a party donor when he moved out of the matrimonial home.

Late Thursday, Turnbull announced that ministers ""regardless of whether they are married or single, must not engage in sexual relations with staff.""

""I am not here to moralize. But, we must recognize that whatever may have been acceptable or to which a blind eye was turned in the past, today, in 2018, it is not acceptable for a minister to have a sexual relationship with somebody who works for them,"" the Prime Minister said.

Turnbull made it clear that his Deputy PM would be in breach of the new rules, if they'd been in place during his affair, making Joyce's position untenable.

It was seen as a direct rebuke of the Nationals leaders' actions, even though the PM is powerless to formally reprimand or remove him. Because Joyce leads a separate political party, Turnbull can't sack him, unless the Nationals do so in a party room coup.

Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce addresses a press conference in Sydney on July 5, 2016.

Joyce is standing fast, and his supporters claim there are few if any signs of numbers moving against him, despite intense media pressure.

There are only 21 Nationals Party MPs and Senators amongst Australia's elected representatives, meaning that Joyce only needs to retain the backing of 10 colleagues to hold firm.

On Thursday, the Prime Minster even suggested Joyce consider his position.

""Barnaby has acknowledged his fault, his error, his grief about his conduct. He has to consider his own position obviously. These are matters for Barnaby Joyce to reflect on,"" Turnbull said.

Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull (L) and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce (R) address the media during a press conference in Sydney on July 5, 2016.

Coup ahead?

A political standoff therefore appears in the offing. The Nationals, Australia's largest party representing the regions, has only removed one leader in its 90-year history in a party room coup.

Momentum for a fresh coup early in the week died down as Nationals MPs came out one by one arguing that Joyce deserves more time to rebuild credibility.

Joyce is a powerful political actor, described by former PM Tony Abbott has the best ""retail politician"" of his generation. His earthy style connects with regional voters.

At the last election when Turnbull's Liberal Party lost more than a dozen seats, the Nationals under Joyce's leadership not only held all of their seats but picked up one more. In short, Joyce saved Turnbull's prime ministership.

The issue now is whether Joyce can rebuild into the retail politician he once was in the wake of this scandal. Liberals don't think so, and so far a majority of Nationals do.

Joyce was due to take over as the acting Prime Minister next week when Turnbull heads to the US for meetings with President Donald Trump, but Joyce is instead taking a leave of absence to try and avoid his tenure becoming a circus.

Because the Foreign Minister and Liberal Party deputy leader Julie Bishop will also be overseas, the leader of the government in the Senate Mathias Cormann will assume the Acting PM role.

Turnbull's move gives him moral authority, stamping out relationships which place staffers in unequal relationships.

But it also invites greater media scrutiny of what has previously been described as the private lives of politicians.

The changes to the ministerial code of conduct remove the cultural barrier to such reporting.

Some of Turnbull's colleagues are concerned about the ""can of worms"" this will open up, as one minister told me shortly after the announcement.",Australian minister's affair leads to sex ban with staffers,http://cnn.com/2018/02/15/opinions/australia-minister-sex-ban-intl/index.html

Fortunately, they're both adorable, which might not be enough to sustain an ABC series that might as well have been titled ""Castle 2.""

The premise again pairs an actual crime fighter with a dabbler in that arena -- in this case, a private eye (""CSI: Miami's"" Eddie Cibrian) and an actress (""Hart of Dixie's"" Rachel Bilson) who once starred in a popular TV cop show.

After a tabloid run-in that left her in rehab, Bilson's Sam Swift is out and looking for redemption in her next big role. She's eager not to mess things up, and hopes to add to her authenticity by shadowing Cibrian's Eddie Valetik, who grudgingly agrees to the assignment as a favor to Sam's agent.

Much sniping, squabbling and sleuthing follows, with Eddie griping about babysitting and saying curmudgeonly things like, ""I like actors. What I don't like are stars."" Sam, meanwhile, keeps trying to solve cases by drawing upon her TV-informed knowledge, which proves occasionally useful, and just as often misguided and dangerous.

The real trick, of course, is to find a way to extend this unlikely partnership beyond the pilot, and the writers -- ""Castle's"" Terri Edda Miller and Andrew W. Marlowe -- accomplish that with a not terribly convincing twist. It's worth noting that both of the characters appear to have lives, and relationships, beyond the central pairing, which of course won't prevent the flirty banter and ""Will they or won't they?"" conceit baked into the premise.

234,234,2018-06-18 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) ""Incredibles 2"" is a huge hit, and ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" isn't. The former exceeded box-office forecasts, while the latter flew well below them.

The natural assumption would be that one movie works, and the other doesn't. But that's not really the case, reflecting how the movie business is now analyzed and pored over like primary results -- an expectations game,where the numbers drive perception, everyone occupies the role of pundit and prognosticator, and the public often sends mixed messages.

Subjectively, both ""Incredibles"" and ""Solo"" are good, solid summer entertainments, derived from established franchises. Yet while Pixar's long-deferred sequel shattered box-office records for animated movies, Lucasfilm's latest addition to the ""Star Wars"" universe fell far short of the standard established by other sequels and spinoffs.

For reasons that still remain something of a mystery, the audience simply didn't show up for ""Solo"" in the anticipated numbers. But it's easy to draw an inference that disparate commercial fortunes serve as a referendum on their creative quality, when the truth is that it has more to do with the limitations of box-office tracking, which like any attempt to predict behavior, has an element of uncertainty baked into it.

Perhaps for that reason, it was refreshing to chat with someone over the weekend who had really enjoyed ""Solo,"" and expressed enthusiasm about a possible sequel to it. When told that was very unlikely to happen -- companies like Disney generally don't double down on bets that, at this point, are projected to lose them money -- she sounded mystified, wondering how they could let the story end where it did.

The Deaf community uses a capital ""D"" to differentiate between people who identify with Deaf culture and identity, and the physical lack of hearing. To learn more about the disability community, watch ""United Shades of America"" on CNN Go .

(CNN) Jerry Coen, a former inmate of the Georgia state prison system, was clean-cut in a bright Nike polo when we connected on Skype. Though we had never met before and were hundreds of miles apart, we were tethered to one another by a shared language and community, and he gave me a smile that mirrored my own -- one of relief at being able to communicate directly to another Deaf person in American Sign Language (ASL). It's a simple act that, for a long time, Coen was denied.

""From the minute you go in, you're trapped in every way,"" he said. ""You're trying to communicate but you can't understand the rules, or any of the information from the loudspeaker; it's a total communication breakdown.""

On Wednesday, the ACLU of Georgia filed a lawsuit against the Georgia Department of Corrections, the State Board of Pardons and Paroles and several individual defendants, alleging systematic discrimination and abuse of its deaf and hard-of hearing inmates. Coen, 44, is one of 14 plaintiffs in the suit who says he suffered under the department's ableist practices, including denied requests for sign language interpreters, denial of medical and mental healthcare, and violence at the hands of guards.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which protects basic civil rights for deaf and disabled people, is supposed to apply to incarcerated people. The law guarantees ""reasonable accommodations"" for disabled people to have equal access to public places. For deaf people, reasonable accommodations often include sign language interpreters, hearing loops or other assistive technology, access to videophones and closed captions. The reality of our nation's prison systems, however, reflects not only a failure to reach the standards of that law, but of widespread neglect and willful mistreatment.

Coen, like a lot of deaf and hard-of-hearing inmates, has limited written English skills, making communication outside of sign language extremely difficult. ASL is a distinct language, with a syntax closer to Japanese than English, rendering even written materials inaccessible to many. Like other populations vulnerable to abuses by the prison industrial complex, deaf and hard-of hearing people experience risk factors starting in childhood that increase their chances of incarceration -- chief among them is language deprivation . When a child doesn't gain language fluency during the brain's "" critical period "" from 0-5 years old, one's capacity for intellectual development is diminished substantially. Since over 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents, language exposure requires a proactive approach that many just don't get.

Subsequent isolation leads to increased instances of learning disabilities and emotional and mental health problems. Difficulty communicating with one's family also puts deaf children at increased risk for sexual abuse, more than three times that of their hearing peers.

These factors compound at the intersections of race, ethnicity and class, so deaf and hard-of-hearing people of color experience the worst rates of abuse throughout all stages of interaction with the justice system. Once incarcerated, this trend continues: According to the ACLU complaint, plaintiff Carlos Herrera, who understands no written English, was unable to read the ""Offender's Handbook,"" leaving him unaware of the administrative grievance process for him to address the other abuses he suffered.

Coen, who filed several grievances over the course of his detainment, said his complaints were dismissed or his paperwork eternally left as ""pending."" His family drove hours to visit him, in part because he was unable to contact them via phone. (According to the Deaf rights advocacy group HEARD, only seven prisons in the country have videophone access for deaf inmates.) Coen was disciplined for ""bad behavior"" for not following the rules he couldn't understand, at one point placed in solitary confinement for a week. He still doesn't know why he was there, having been denied an interpreter at the disciplinary hearing. He was also handcuffed with his hands behind his back at the hearing, preventing him from using gesture to communicate.

""They say I had anger problems. Of course, I had anger problems. I was frustrated!"" Coen says he had no access to any of the rehabilitative programs run by the prison -- 12-step, anger management and educational programs are all rendered useless for deaf inmates without interpreters. He also told me he was denied an interpreter for doctors' appointments, at which he says he tried writing back and forth but that the ""words were too hard."" He adds he was also denied mental health care, though he repeatedly requested an evaluation -- at one point writing, ""I really need help.""

""The guards were so cruel,"" Coen said. ""Once one of them got mad and took my hearing aid and crushed it."" Coen filed a grievance over the exchange, but the Department of Corrections rejected the complaint, writing the destruction of his property ""does not effect [sic] him personally.""

Being a deaf inmate is often referred to by disability-rights advocates as a ""prison within a prison,"" with little to no human interaction among fellow inmates, guards or their families. ACLU Disability Rights Program Fellow Zoe Brennan-Krohn said in an email, ""it can be almost impossible for incarcerated people with disabilities to share their experiences of trauma and discrimination with the outside world.""

It's no surprise, then, that with no access to mental health or educational services, fewer tools for reintegration into society, and often no clear explanation of the terms of their release, deaf inmates return to prison faster than their hearing counterparts. While austerity measures are frequently used as excuses for not providing accommodations, the provision of an interpreter would certainly be the lesser monetary burden on taxpayers than reincarceration over a miscommunication.

A Georgia Department of Corrections spokesperson, Joan Heath, told the Associated Press Wednesday that the agency doesn't comment on pending litigation, but that improvements were being made within the system to better things for hard-of-hearing inmates.

It's difficult to get people to pay attention to the rights of inmates, especially those who are doubly or triply marginalized. ""The intersection of disability discrimination with our criminal legal system leads to enormous injustices,"" said Brennan-Krohn. ""We hope more people will learn about these glaring violations of civil rights and human rights.""

In the current political climate, it's easy to be overwhelmed by the pervasiveness of injustice across society. Even in my own work as an advocate for the Deaf community, I too often allow the rights and needs of those incarcerated to fall by the wayside. But trickle-down liberation doesn't work. Rather, if we allow authorities to exploit the civil rights of the most vulnerable, those violations serve as precedents to strip the rights from others.

America is fast learning that the way we treat inmates and detainees is a reflection of our country's values, and inextricable from our own moral and political futures.

But what about the positive role models our girls are seeing? Certainly, the #MeToo movement has called attention to the need to create more substantial roles for women of all ages on the big and small screens and to get more women behind the scenes in director and screenwriting roles.

Even before the past six months when women's voices have been heard in ways they haven't been before, there were signs -- exciting signs -- of shifting portrayals of young women, even in children's programming.

Research shows that kids develop stereotypes at early ages. A Common Sense Media analysis of more than 150 articles, interviews and books and other research found that kids between the ages of 7 and 10 start to attribute certain qualities to women and men, such as that women are emotional and men are aggressive.

Let me say that one more time. Between 7 and 10.

Helping young girls and boys during these ages see realistic portraits of girls and boys can have enormous benefits, which brings me to ""Andi Mack,"" Disney Channel's No. 1 show in video on demand. The show just wrapped its second season and has been renewed for a third.

Think about the storyline, which is uncharted territory for mainstream children's programming: The main character, Andi, learns that the person she thought was her older sister for 13 years is actually her mother and that the two people she thought were her parents are actually her grandparents. Andi grapples with these life-changing circumstances with the support of her two best friends: the gender-stereotype-bashing Buffy, who believes she is as strong -- or stronger -- than any of the boys, and Cyrus, who has only recently shared with his friends that he is gay.

My girls, ages 10 and 11, and I watch the show -- together -- every Friday night. We recently had a chance to sit down with the show's creator and three of its stars.

'A girl can do anything a boy can do'

TerrI Minksy, the creator and executive producer of ""Andi Mack,"" wanted to create a show that mothers could watch with their daughters. She said she didn't create the characters with female empowerment in mind but very much was focused on the point of view of the girl, because girlhood is when girls begin to get a sense of their own power or lack thereof.

""There's always this 'you can grow up to be whatever you want,' but we haven't seen a female president in the United States. We don't see female faces when you're looking at anything where decisions are being made,"" said Minsky, who made the pilot with a predominantly female team.

""I just feel like it has to start with the kids as represented in the shows as having the power over their world, and hopefully that translates to people watching it without specifically calling it female power.""

Sofia Wylie plays Buffy, who tries out for and makes the boys' basketball team (she also ends up tutoring the captain of the team). Sofia, 14, believes that her character can serve as an empowering role model to girls who watch.

""I would definitely say Buffy sends a message that a girl can do anything a boy can do and there's really no difference,"" said Sofia, also an accomplished dancer who has performed on stage with Justin Bieber and on ""America's Got Talent.""

""So many people say, 'Oh, yeah, boys are just like stronger,' and when a boy says that, I'm going to contain myself now,"" she says to laughter as she indicates how frustrated that statement makes her feel. ""It's not true. If a woman wants to put their mind to something, they can be just as intelligent and just as strong physically and mentally in every way. They can be even better than a man.""

Even today, in 2018, a woman who is competitive -- especially in the workplace -- may be viewed differently than a man. A man may be considered assertive, a woman aggressive. Sofia says her character tackles that double standard as well.

""People think if you're competitive, that means you're mean,"" she said. ""No, she's competitive for a separate reason, because she's been told that she has to be strong."" In one episode, we learn that Buffy feels she needs to always be strong to help her cope when her mom, who is in the military, is away during months-long deployments.

A story line with #MeToo resonance

One of the recurring storylines that also tackles gender stereotypes head-on is Andi's crush on the handsome, athletic and very popular Jonah Beck. During season one and the first half of season two, Andi is basically obsessed with Jonah. At some point, it appears they may actually be boyfriend and girlfriend in the way 13-year-olds innocently begin relationships. She makes him a bracelet. She beams when she sees him. But he never seems to truly understand Andi and never does for Andi all the things she does for him.

And then, Andi has had enough. With the support of her friends Buffy and Cyrus and her mom, Bex, she finally decides to tell Jonah that she has been obsessed with him and that she can no longer continue doing what she has been doing. It is the moment when, I would argue, many women watching (and many who have experienced #MeToo moments) ask themselves, ""Why didn't I say that when I was in a similar situation?""

"" allowfullscreen>

Lilan Bowden, who plays Bex, Andi's independent and individualistic mother, says she wishes she had ""Andi Mack"" when she was a girl. Instead, the shows she watched all repeated the same story line: The girl has a crush on the boy, the boy finally says he likes her back, and they get together.

""That was the message that I felt like I received over and over again: Just do the nice thing. If you're nice and you keep being nice and you don't stop being nice, eventually, you'll get what you want,"" Bowden said. ""And to have that character to say, 'I was nice, and you didn't appreciate it because you're not nice enough back to me' was huge.""

Lilan Bowden, right, plays Andi's mother on the show ""Andi Mack.""

Minsky said the episode was written more as a natural progression of Andi's character and less in response to the #MeToo movement.

When Andi expresses herself to Jonah, she's the one who is in charge for the first time, said Minsky, who also created ""Lizzie McGuire,"" a live-action and animated series that was also a Disney Channel hit.

""It's always the girl giving and embarrassing herself and putting herself out there and taking chances, and the boy's sitting back, and you don't know how he feels ... and then she finally expresses herself, and he's like 'Oh, wow, I really enjoy that you're obsessed with me,' and I kind of feel, 'yeah, I bet you did.' "" (In another sign of the show's relatable nature, it tackles anxiety when Jonah has a panic attack after Andi tells him she is moving on.)

Peyton Elizabeth Lee, who plays Andi, said she, Sofia and Bowden cheered when they read that episode because it was a sign that Andi was ""finally finding her voice.""

""Because she's just been so caught up in 'Jonah's cute, and he's fun, and he has so many friends, and he's popular, and he's athletic and whatever,' but when it really comes down to it, he wasn't giving her enough credit for everything she was doing for him,"" said Peyton, 13, who has appeared on ABC's ""Scandal"" and ""Shameless"" on Showtime.

""I think she was realizing that she's worth more, so it was a really exciting thing ... where she's saying 'I was obsessed with you,' and it's Andi realizing that she doesn't need him to feel complete.""

Gender equality in media? Long way to go

There is no question that we need to see more realistic and authentic female characters on television and in film.

Research commissioned by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in the Media in 2014 shows how far we need to go. It found that the percentage of female characters in the work force in TV and film was less than 25%, when women make up just about half of the actual work force.

Fictional male judges and lawyers outnumbered female characters in those same roles 13 to 1; the breakdown of men to women was 7.6 to 1 when it came to characters in computer science and engineering.

We know that when you see it, you can be it. In a survey of 1,000 women in the United States and the United Kingdom, conducted by the Davis Institute and J. Walter Thompson and unveiled in 2017, 71% of respondents in the US and 63% in the UK said that if we saw more corporate leader characters who were women, it would make it easier for women to become leaders in the corporate sector.

Sixty-four percent of respondents in the US and the UK said that seeing more female characters as politicians would make it easier for women to succeed in politics.

Bowden, who also regularly performs improv and sketch comedy, hopes shows like ""Andi Mack"" are a marker for what is to come.

When she got to Hollywood and was auditioning, there was a very limited selection of roles for women, she said. ""It's almost like a paying of dues where ... you're pretty much just the eye candy,"" she said. ""I didn't want to be a model. I wanted to be an actor, but there's so many roles that are written for women where they just kind of pigeonhole you into being a model.

""This show is all these dynamic female characters that aren't relying on beauty at all, and that's not an experience I felt like I had when I was first auditioning,"" she said.

With surveys showing that girl confidence dips around puberty , having strong female early-teenage role models who speak truthfully and aren't afraid to stand up for what they believe can only be a positive.

""I think you can take so many things away (from the show) but just being confident in yourself,"" Sofia told my daughters. ""I think that's the best thing about all of our characters is, we're all ourselves.""

Added Peyton, ""A lot of shows showcase if you're just nicer, it all works out. If you're nice, you get friends. You have a boyfriend, but it's just not like that, and you have to find that balance of being nice, but being careful. ... You have to figure out which way you want to go.""",Looking at children's programming through a #MeToo lens,http://cnn.com/2018/03/02/health/childrens-programming-female-empowerment-role-models/index.html
238,238,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) An international election watchdog has criticized the conditions under which the Turkish election was fought, saying they were skewed in favor of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his party.

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said Erdogan had benefited from excessive media coverage and raised questions about the transparency of the vote. But it did not find any significant irregularities on election day.

Erdogan, who secured a new five-year term as President on the first round of voting on Sunday, re-enters office with a vast array of new powers at his disposal, following a narrowly-won constitutional referendum last year.

Under the new system, the office of prime minister is abolished, parliament's powers curtailed and the president is accorded wide-ranging executive authority.

Opposition leader Muharrem Ince conceded defeat, and warned that Turkey would suffer from ""one-man rule"" at the hands of Erdogan.

Erdogan claimed victory even before the electoral authorities had confirmed the result. The election commission later confirmed Erdogan the winner, and also said Erdogan's Justice and development Party (AKP) and its allied Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) had retained their parliamentary majority.

While the commission gave no figures on Erdogan's victory, state-run news agency Anadolu put Erdogan on 52.5%, well ahead of Ince on 31%, with more than 96% of the votes counted.

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said that the vote lacked ""conditions for contestants to compete on an equal basis.""

""The incumbent president and his party enjoyed a notable advantage, also reflected in excessive coverage by government-funded, public and private media,"" OSCE special coordinator Ignacio Sanchez Amor told a press conference Monday.

In its report, the OSCE also raised concerns about transparency in the vote count, pointing to changes in the law that replaced political party representatives with civil servants as chairs of ballot box committees. It also pointed to the relocation of polling stations on security grounds as a concern, an issue that opposition parties said were attempts to make voting more difficult in their strongholds.

A polling station worker holds a ballot in the mainly-Kurdish city of Diyarbakir in southeastern Turkey on Sunday.

'We're now in a one-man rule'

The results were a blow to Ince and his Republican People's Party, known as the CHP. Ince ran a spirited campaign that threatened to force Erdogan into a damaging runoff and deny his party control of parliament.

Conceding defeat, Ince warned that constitutional changes ushered in by Erdogan earlier in the year represented a threat to the country's democracy.

Turkey's President and leader of ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) Recep Tayyip Erdogan addresses supporters.

""A single person is becoming the head of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary and this is a concern for a threat to the survival of the country,"" he told journalists. ""Turkey has departed from democratic values and Turkey has broken its ties with the parliamentary system which it had.""

""We're now in a one-man rule -- there's no mechanism to prevent arbitrary rule. We continue to have great concerns about this situation.""

Having defeated the twin threats of a reinvigorated opposition and a weakened currency, Erdogan addressed cheering supporters in the capital, Ankara, saying the winner of the election was democracy, the national will and the nation itself.

""The winner of this election is each and every individual of my 81 million citizens,"" he said.

""Turkey has decided to take the side of growth, development, investment, enrichment and a reputable, honorable and influential country in all areas in the world.""","Erdogan won the Turkish election after an unequal battle, monitors say",http://cnn.com/2018/06/25/europe/turkey-elections-erdogan-monitors-intl/index.html

Humans are ""accidental hosts"" of the worm, which is often cured by surgical removal

(CNN) In selfies, a woman documented a lump under her skin for weeks before doctors were able to remove it -- and it didn't stay in one place, according to a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The lump appeared after the unnamed woman, 32, visited a rural area outside Moscow. First, it was a small bump under her left eye. Five days later, it appeared above the eye. Her upper lip was bulging 10 days after that.

Doctors ultimately gripped the bulge with forceps and, using local anesthesia, pulled out a parasitic worm known as Dirofilaria repens.

""The parasite can appear and disappear in few minutes,"" Dr. Vladimir Kartashev, a professor of medicine at Rostov State Medical University who saw the patient, told CNN in an email. ""Doctors who are not familiar with the disease don't believe ... the patients. That's why I asked the patient to make selfies.""

But Kartashev had seen ""at least 10 patients with the same presentation before,"" and the migrating form can be ""extremely confusing,"" he said.

Growing up, she knew the word ""Korea"" before she even understood what it meant.

""I'd heard that word since before I could talk,"" she told CNN. ""It was just part of our life.""

Her father, Karle Seydel, was 24 when he left his wife, daughter and months-old son in Seattle, Washington to join the eventually hundreds of thousands of United States troops sent to the Korean Peninsula to fight in a bloody conflict which, almost 70 years later, has still not officially ended

The remains of thousands of US soldiers are still in North Korea, despite decades of effort by families and the US military to repatriate them.

Following his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore this month, US President Donald Trump said the remains of hundreds of soldiers will be handed over in the near future

But while this may bring relief to some families after more than 60 years of trauma and uncertainty, the remains of many more thousands of soldiers in North Korea are as yet unaccounted for and, with even the children of Korean War soldiers aged in their 60s, for some time is quickly running out.

War and division

The Japan-colonized Korean Peninsula was divided in two following Tokyo's surrender at the end of World War II, with the Soviet Union occupying the North and the US the South.

Two new ideologically opposite countries were established in 1948: The southern Republic of Korea (ROK) and northern Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).

Strongman leaders in both sought full reunification of the Peninsula under their rule, and in 1950 tensions spilled over into war.

North Korean forces, with the backing of both China and the Soviet Union, outmatched their South Korean counterparts, and in the early hours of the conflict US officials on the Peninsula warned of North Korea's ""complete air superiority"" as ROK forces struggled to repulse North Korean tank units.

""The North Korean objective in invading South Korea is outright control over the Korean peninsula,"" said an intelligence report prepared for US President Harry Truman shortly after tanks rolled over the border. ""North Korea presently intends to attain a decisive victory through: the capture of Seoul in the next 7-day period.""

It warned that South Korean forces were ""militarily inferior"" to their Northern counterparts and could not repulse the invasion alone.

A Marine Corps honors brigade fires a volley over the graves of those who fell during the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir.

US representatives began lobbying the United Nations Security Council, then only five years old, to take action.

On June 27, Truman told the American people he had ""ordered United States air and sea forces to give the Korean Government troops cover and support.""

The first hot conflict of the still evolving Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union, Truman and his advisers viewed the situation in Korea as part of a wider battle against Communism, even drawing up plans to ""wipe out all Soviet air bases in the Far East,"" and dispatching US naval assets to Taiwan to repulse an expected Chinese invasion, should the war intensify.

Before hostilities ceased in Korea on July 27, 1953, more than 1.2 million soldiers were killed on all sides, as well as an additional 1.6 million civilians, many killed by a brutal US bombing campaign which left most of North Korea in ruins

The armistice agreement signed on that day established the 250-kilometer (160-mile), heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, formalizing the division of the Peninsula and separating families on either side of the de facto border as each country moved further and further apart even as governments in both still advocated for official unification

Identifying remains

Also cut off from the outside world, left behind inside an increasingly isolated North Korea, were the remains of thousands of US troops never recovered from the battlefield.

According to the US Department of Defense, 7,697 personnel from the Korean conflict are still unaccounted for, 5,300 of whom are believed to be north of the 38th parallel.

Since 1990, the remains of 340 soldiers have been handed over by North Korea via the DMZ.

An additional 200 sets of remains are believed to have been identified by Pyongyang as likely belonging to US troops, which officials in Washington expect to be handed over in the coming days.

While arrangements have yet to be made, a spokeswoman for US Forces Korea said the remains will likely be handed over via the United Nations authority at the DMZ, as in the past.

After a repatriation ceremony, they will be transferred to a state-of-the-art military facility in Hawaii, the largest skeletal identification laboratory in the world, where they will be identified ""using forensic anthropology, odontology, DNA and other scientific methods.""

First, skeletal remains are examined to ascertain a ""biological profile,"" including sex, race, stature and age at death, as well as information that can be gleaned about the cause of death or medical conditions that could be used to identify the remains.

Most important are DNA evidence and dental impressions that can be taken from the remains, as these are the best chance of linking them to missing military personnel.

Honor guards carry a casket containing the remains of a United Nations Command soldier killed inside North Korea during the Korean War, during a joint repatriation ceremony at Yongsan garrison in Seoul on April 28, 2016.

For years, the military has encouraged family members of Korean War soldiers to donate DNA that can be potentially used to identify their relatives' remains, taking three cheek swabs per person to build up a collection of cells that can be matched to bones and other material recovered from battlefields or disinterred from unmarked graves.

""The US has a very well established team dealing with such remains for a long time now,"" said Dr. Philip Beh, a professor at the University of Hong Kong's Department of Pathology. ""Once the bones get back to the US there's a lot they can do.""

Key to carrying out identification based on remains is how well they have been exhumed and stored.

""If it has been stored in a pretty dry and clean facility, then in terms of getting measurements from the bones, that's very doable,"" said Beh. ""How much in terms of DNA you can collect from the bones really depends on the conditions that they may be in.""

He added that if the set of bones is relatively complete, and particularly if dental remains are recovered, identification could potentially be done in a matter of days.

Long search

Around 90% of missing Korean War soldiers have some kind of family DNA information on file for them, according to the DOD

One of those who has donated DNA is Hebert, who joined other members of her family in providing as much data as possible to the military in the hope that it will one day lead to the remains of her father, Karle Seydel.

US military records show that 1st Lt. Karle Seydel was killed on December 7, 1950, during the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir , a successful effort by Chinese troops to push US forces back into South Korea.

""Karle was a terror on that hill,"" fellow soldier John Hinds wrote later in an account shared by the Hebert family with CNN. ""I didn't get to know him too well but my memory of him in that battle is vivid as we assaulted the hill he was fearless and looked like someone out of a John Wayne movie.""

At the time of her husband's death, Rosanne Seydel was staying with her parents in coastal Washington state, caring for her two young children. They received the news by telegram, not knowing what information the message would contain until they collected it from a local town.

""They had to pick it up,"" Hebert said. ""It's not like in the movies.""

A column of troops and armor of the 1st Marine Division move through communist Chinese lines during their successful breakout from the Chosin Reservoir in North Korea. The Marines were besieged when the Chinese entered the Korean War Nov. 27, 1950, by sending 200,000 shock troops against Allied forces.

In a later telegram to Rosanne in February 1951, Maj. A. R. Carson of the US Marine Corps Personal Affairs Branch wrote that Karle ""lost his life as a result of a missile wound sustained while he was engaged in combat.""

""I am sorry to tell you that ... his remains were not recovered,"" he said. ""You are assured that every effort is made to recover the remains of our gallant marines who have fallen in battle.""

""You will be promptly notified of any further information received,"" the message continued, adding that ""it is presumed"" Rosanne would pass on the information to Karle's mother.

Five years later, in 1956, Seydel's Marine record was updated to note the ""non-recoverability of remains.""

An end to war

Decades later, Rosanne, now 92, is still hoping her husband's body will be found.

Earlier this year, she and Herbert traveled to South Korea as part of the Revisit Korea Program organized by the ROK's Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs.

They were in the country when President Moon Jae-in met with Kim Jong Un and signed an historic accord pledging to work towards the end of the Korean War

""To finally go there, to be in Korea that historic week was fantastic, dreamlike, and so rewarding,"" Hebert said.

Rosanne Seydel and Ruth Hebert hold the portrait of First Lieutenant Karle Seydel, who was killed on December 7, 1950 during the Korean War.

During the trip, one man was informed that the remains of his brother had been recovered in South Korea. ""He was so thrilled for the rest of the week,"" Hebert said. ""He was just glowing, this search had gone on for so much of his life.""

While she did not leave the Peninsula with her father's remains, she returned home with a newspaper bearing a large full page picture of Moon and Kim and the headline ""Koreas to declare end to Korean War.""

As she watched Trump meeting with Kim in Singapore weeks later, Hebert was remind of the lyrics of a widely covered 1950 song by Ed McCurdy: ""Last night I had the strangest dream, I'd ever dreamed before. I dreamed the world had all agreed, to put an end to war.""

While hundreds of remains are due to be handed over soon, a formal end to the war and improved relations between North Korea and the US are likely necessary for the recovery of the remains of thousands of other soldiers still in the country.

Many of those corpses, the result of large, bloody battles, will be buried in unmarked and mass graves, which will require careful exhumation and make ascertaining which bones belong to whom far more difficult.

""You would have to send teams in, have to survey the ground, get a sense of what the lie of things are,"" said Beh, the University of Hong Kong expert. ""It would be a long, long exercise.""

At present, there are no plans to do so, and having US military investigators inside North Korea would require a massive step forward even for a relationship that has seen major improvements in recent months.

For many family members of the missing, time is running out. During Hebert's trip to South Korea, ""there were a number of very senior adults, a lot of gray and white hair.""

241,241,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) President Donald Trump has hit on a new exit strategy as he struggles to mitigate the most disorientating political crisis of his presidency: the splitting up of undocumented migrant families.

His obvious conclusion is that even though his hardline populism got him into the mess, only a more unfiltered dose of Trumpism will finally sweep it away.

Trump fired off some of his most raw and authoritarian tweets about immigration yet Sunday and is also cranking up his trade war rhetoric to solidify the safe space where he always returns when he's in trouble: the embrace of his political base.

""We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country,"" Trump wrote in a tweet that hammered undocumented migrants on Sunday.

""When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order,"" he wrote.

The President also intensified his assault on trade -- like immigration, a pillar of his 2016 election campaign -- a few weeks ahead of a trip to Europe looming as yet another clash with America's closest allies.

""The United States is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial Trade Barriers and Tariffs on goods going into their country, remove those Barriers & Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the U.S.A.,"" he wrote. ""Trade must be fair and no longer a one way street!""

Trump's trust in these key themes is significant because it shows his reliance on a method that has been wildly successful, but which failed him last week.

Usually when he gets in trouble, Trump is been able to whip up another outrage or drama to keep up the breakneck speed of a careening political career that needs incessant controversy and anger to ensure that no single drama lingers for sufficient time to derail it.

But despite the President's efforts, the Trump train has been stalled on the tracks for days.

Images of scared children and depictions of shattered families that tested the nation's self-image as a beacon of compassion thwarted the President's efforts to return to full steam ahead.

There was unusual dissent from loyalists in a Republican Party that Trump has thoroughly changed and monopolized. His declaration that he did not cause the problem and that it was the fault of Democrats failed to bite. His own bid to bail himself out with an executive order ending separations only heightened a sense of incompetence as the White House couldn't explain how it would reunite families.

The administration even gave up explaining itself. For four straight days last week, there was no White House press briefing, adding to the sense of disarray.

As a new week dawns, Trump will need to extricate himself from the mess before it does more damage to his party ahead of the midterm elections in November and try somehow to regain his dominance of the political narrative.

If his administration can finally get a handle on the family separations, it's possible the crisis could fade. However, Trump may not get much help from Congress since House Republicans face long odds in their effort to pass a bill that includes codifying an end to separations in law, which would almost certainly be dead on arrival in the Senate.

If that's the case, it's possible a standalone measure on the issue could gain momentum.

Indications over the weekend however were that the steps the administration is using to deal with the human toll of separations will cause a new round of controversy.

CNN's Tal Kopan, citing an administration official, reported that immigrants in detention were being offered the chance to sign voluntary deportation orders to be removed from the country more quickly than if they waited for a judge.

In the case of parents separated from their kids, they're also told that if they sign the paperwork, then they will be reunited -- if they choose to be -- before they are deported from the country.

Trump as a strongman

On the political front, the President, characteristically, is choosing to attack.

His tweet on immigration was a classic maneuver by a populist leader with authoritarian instincts.

His use of the phrase ""invade"" was borrowed from a strongman's playbook in which outside forces, often of a different ethnicity, are used by a leader to portray his nation as vulnerable to forces that want to change its character.

The tweet sparked immediate alarm from critics who worry about the philosophical direction of Trump's political project.

""What President Trump has suggested here is both illegal and unconstitutional. Any official who has sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws should disavow it unequivocally,"" said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project.

Trump used a similar formulation last week when he sought to exacerbate German Chancellor Angela Merkel's political woes as she faces a backlash against her refugee policies, erroneously claiming crime had risen in Germany as a result.

""Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!"" Trump tweeted on January 18.

The media is often accused of overreacting about Trump's authoritarian reflexes on Twitter. Yet this is a President who has constantly sought to test the limits of his power. He has pressured the Justice Department over special counsel Robert Mueller's probe. He has publicly speculated about pardoning himself if the special counsel finds he transgressed. He has cozied up to dictators while slamming America's friends.

There are still many unanswered questions about how the separation crisis will shape the Trump presidency in the long term.

On the one hand, the suffering of children and the imagery that it sketched look likely to be a long-term stain on the administration and will be remembered by history as one of the most emotive moments of his entire presidency.

It's possible that this is a turning point that brought home the changes being wrought in America's character by the Trump presidency and could influence moderate Republican voters and independents who he needs to win re-election.

Maybe a new moral line was drawn in the sand over separations and public outrage could begin to constrain the President more on one of his signature issues.

With Republicans already struggling to cling to power in the House in November, pollsters will be trying to gauge the impact of the last week -- particularly in the suburbs and among women who live there -- in districts that could swing the midterm election.

Yet there's also a case that spending a week at war with the media on immigration will only strengthen the bond between Trump and the loyal voters who put him in the White House -- the same group who must come out in droves in November to stave off a GOP defeat.

There is a strong argument that Trump understands the instincts of his key voters on immigration better than other Republicans and the media -- even if his actions are seen by critics as an abrogation of the moral values on which America is built.

But it's also the case that his wider political prospects cannot afford another week like the last one.","After family separation crisis, Trump returns to his tried-and-true tactic: ratchet up the rhetoric",http://cnn.com/2018/06/25/politics/trump-immigration-trade-rhetoric/index.html

An initial police report found that the 23-year-old had attacked her parents, inflicting fatal wounds to her father's chest, and her mother's chest, waist and legs.

Their bodies were found by police after a relative called authorities, telling them that no one had answered the door at the apartment in Tuen Mun, a residential neighborhood of Hong Kong.

A 30-centimeter knife, which was suspected to have been used in the attack, was recovered at the scene, police said.

The couple's daughter Pang Ching-yu was also found dead at the scene. Police said they found a suicide note in Pang's bedroom saying she was bothered by long-term eczema.

243,243,2018-03-26 00:00:00,cnn.com,"The world is obsessed with fad diets and weight loss, yet few of us know how a kilogram of fat actually vanishes off the scales.

Even the 150 doctors, dietitians and personal trainers we surveyed shared this surprising gap in their health literacy . The most common misconception by far, was that fat is converted to energy. The problem with this theory is that it violates the law of conservation of matter, which all chemical reactions obey.

Some respondents thought fat turns into muscle, which is impossible, and others assumed it escapes via the colon. Only three of our respondents gave the right answer, which means 98% of the health professionals in our survey could not explain how weight loss works.

So if not energy, muscles or the loo, where does fat go?

The enlightening facts about fat metabolism

The correct answer is that fat is converted to carbon dioxide and water. You exhale the carbon dioxide and the water mixes into your circulation until it's lost as urine or sweat.

If you lose 10 pounds of fat, precisely 8.4 pounds comes out through your lungs and the remaining 1.6 pounds turns into water. In other words, nearly all the weight we lose is exhaled.

This surprises just about everyone, but actually, almost everything we eat comes back out via the lungs. Every carbohydrate you digest and nearly all the fats are converted to carbon dioxide and water. The same goes for alcohol.

Protein shares the same fate, except for the small part that turns into urea and other solids, which you excrete as urine.

The only thing in food that makes it to your colon undigested and intact is dietary fibre (think corn). Everything else you swallow is absorbed into your bloodstream and organs and, after that, it's not going anywhere until you've vaporised it.

Kilograms in versus kilograms out

We all learn that ""energy in equals energy out"" in high school. But energy is a notoriously confusing concept, even among health professionals and scientists who study obesity

The reason we gain or lose weight is much less mysterious if we keep track of all the kilograms, too, not just those enigmatic kilojoules or calories.

According to the latest government figures, Americans consume 3.55 kg (125 ounces) of food and beverages every day. Of that, 430 grams (about 15 ounces) is solid macronutrients , 17 grams (0.6 ounces) is fibre and the remaining 3.11 kg (110 ounces) is water

What's not reported is that we inhale more than 660 grams (23 ounces) worth of oxygen, too, and this figure is equally important for your waistline.

If you put 3.55 kg (125 ounces) of food and water into your body, plus 660 grams of oxygen (23 ounces), then 4.2 kg (148 ounces) of stuff needs to come back out, or you'll gain weight. If you're hoping to shed some weight, more than 4.1kg will have to go.

The 430 grams (15.2 ounces) of carbohydrates, fats, protein and alcohol most Americans eat every day will produce exactly 770 grams (27.1 ounces) of carbon dioxide plus 290 grams (10.2 ounces) of water (about one cup) and about 31 grams (1.1 ounces) of urea and other solids excreted as urine.

An average 75kg (165 pound) person's resting metabolic rate (the rate at which the body uses energy when the person isn't moving) produces about 590 grams (21 ounces) of carbon dioxide per day. No pill or potion you can buy will increase that figure, despite the bold claims you might have heard.

The good news is that you exhale 200 grams (7 ounces) of carbon dioxide while you're fast asleep every night, so you've already breathed out a quarter of your daily target before you even step out of bed.

Eat less, exhale more

So if fat turns into carbon dioxide, could simply breathing more make you lose weight? Unfortunately not. Huffing and puffing more than you need to is called hyperventilation and will only make you dizzy, or possibly faint. The only way you can consciously increase the amount of carbon dioxide your body is producing is by moving your muscles.

But here's some more good news. Simply standing up and getting dressed more than doubles your metabolic rate. In other words, if you simply tried on all your outfits for 24 hours, you'd exhale more than 1,200 grams (42 ounces) of carbon dioxide.

More realistically, going for a walk triples your metabolic rate, and so will cooking, vacuuming and sweeping

Metabolising 100 ounces of fat consumes 290 ounces of oxygen and produces 280 ounces of carbon dioxide plus 110 ounces of water. The food you eat can't change these figures.

Therefore, to lose 100 ounces of fat, you have to exhale 280 ounces of carbon dioxide on top of what you'll produce by vaporising all your food, no matter what you eat.

Any diet that supplies less ""fuel"" than you burn will do the trick, but with so many misconceptions about how weight loss works, few of us know why.",Where fat goes when you lose weight,http://cnn.com/2018/03/26/health/lose-weight-where-does-it-go-partner/index.html
244,244,2018-06-22 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Julian Zelizer is a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University, editor of "" The Presidency of Barack Obama: A First Historical Assessment "" and co-host of the ""Politics & Polls"" podcast. Follow him on Twitter: @julianzelizer . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) According to a new CNN poll conducted by the SSRS, a stunning 42% of Americans believe that President Trump should be impeached and removed from office -- close to the 43% who felt the same way about President Richard Nixon during the climactic months of Watergate in March of 1974. The percentage is far higher than the 29% who said in 1998 that they favored President Clinton being impeached.

Is it possible that impeachment might really be on the table?

The truth is that the odds of impeachment remain extremely low -- barring Robert Mueller's team revealing some kind of ""smoking gun"" evidence of impeachable activity by President Trump of the most extreme degree. Otherwise, despite the new polls, Trump will likely remain in office regardless of the outcome in the midterm elections -- at least until January 2021.

Currently, impeachment is a pipe dream. Members of the Republican Congress have made it painfully clear that they have no interest in doing anything that seriously threatens the President. The political antennae on most representatives and senators signal to them that doing anything serious to challenge the President will come at an extremely high cost. The surprise primary defeat of Mark Sanford, who Trump called a ""nasty guy,"" added to these kinds of fears.

Trump's support within the Republican electorate remains strong -- in the same poll, 87% of Republicans and those who lean in the GOP's direction were against impeachment. Despite all of his troubling decisions and rhetoric, Republicans keep registering that their support for Trump is not seriously wavering. Even some of his most controversial decisions, such as the separation of families trying to enter the United States, have much more solid support in red parts of the electorate.

House Republicans have not even been willing to conduct a serious investigation into the evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. With a strong economy to boot, the GOP is placing its bets on the incumbent.

Republicans are even hoping to use the threat of impeachment as a way to whip up their own base in the midterm elections. At a rally in Michigan in April, Trump warned that Democrats would impeach him if they took control of the House.

What if there's a Democratic Congress?

But what if Democrats actually regain control of Congress in the midterm elections this coming November? There are some candidates running who are calling for impeachment and promising that the Democrats won't be afraid to take this step if necessary. Despite Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi throwing cold water on the idea during a recent conversation with CNN's Chris Cuomo , other Democrats are hoping that the situation might change dramatically should the midterms go well for them.

If there is a Democratic Congress in January 2019, however, the odds for impeachment will still be very low. Fresh with congressional power for the first time since 2014, many Democrats will be wary about investing their political energy in impeachment, just as most Democrats stepped away from that option in 1987.

During the Iran Contra scandal, the nation learned that high-ranking officials in Ronald Reagan's administration had sold arms to Iran and used the proceeds to provide support to the Nicaraguan Contras despite a congressional ban on doing so.

Speaker of the House Jim Wright felt that Democrats were best served focusing on their policy agenda and taking advantage of the weakened state of the administration. Putting the nation through the traumatic process of impeachment, Wright concluded, would not serve voters or the Democrats.

When impeachment backfired

During the Clinton administration, the Republicans came to the opposite conclusion and chose the impeachment route in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. It backfired -- with President Clinton's approval ratings soaring.

Democrats have watched as President Trump has systematically attempted to discredit the Mueller investigation as a partisan ""witch hunt"" and won't have trouble imagining him doing the same to a Democratic Congress.

Unless Robert Mueller offers a clear-cut case to remove Trump -- one that would command the support of two-thirds of the Senate, which means some Republicans joining in a positive vote -- Democrats would probably decide to concentrate on pushing their policy agenda. They would try to strengthen their party for the 2020 election and capitalize on having a damaged Republican President in office who could drag down his entire party.

While the possibility of a second Trump term will scare Democrats, the opportunity for a one-term presidency and major Democratic victory will surely excite many members of the party to use their two years building a winning coalition rather than being all about taking down Trump.

Many Democrats would also rightfully be concerned about unleashing the impeachment process in our destructive age of partisan polarization. There is a good reason that Congress historically had been so resistant toward using this mechanism, fearing that it would become a normalized tool of combat like the filibuster has been in recent decades -- but potentially even worse because impeachment has the potential to overturn the results of an election.

Given the extreme nature of the current political moment, with false statements easily masquerading as truth and radical political voices gaining mainstream platforms in the Oval Office and on national television, Democrats will think hard about pulling the trigger for a process which could easily fail -- or place a very conservative Mike Pence in the presidency.

They know that if the party goes through with this, Republicans will be clamoring to do the same to a Democratic president in the future. This does not mean that impeachment should always be off the table. But it should be a mechanism of last resort given how fragile our political institutions have become.

If you are a Democrat, the best way to check President Trump is to build the political pressure that is necessary for a muscular Congress to conduct oversight that checks the executive branch and, more importantly, to take the steps that are necessary to defeat him in 2020.

When she was 9, Shalom and her younger sister were napping under a table at their mother's restaurant in Nigeria. Her mom, unaware of the sleeping girls below, placed a pot of hot oil on the table. Someone accidentally knocked the pot over, scalding the sisters.

The girls were rushed to the hospital, severely burned. Eventually, an aunt got them visas so they could come to the United States and undergo several surgeries.

Shalom Blac was burned in a kitchen accident when she was 9 years old.

A dark place

After the accident, Shalom's life took a ""huge, huge turn.""

""Kids that I used to play with, they were either scared of me or some would call me 'monster' and 'two-face' and just laugh. I started thinking about committing suicide because of the bullying.""

As a little girl, Shalom loved playing with her mother's makeup. But she first learned how to properly wear it during her hospital stay in the United States.

""They were teaching me how to do makeup even though I wasn't good. I used to just have concealer all over my face and go to school. It was horrible.""

Then, one day while watching YouTube, she came across cosmetics tutorials that changed her life.

""That's how I picked up on how to do a lot of different stuff. And I started applying that to how I want my makeup to look and how I want to look with makeup. ""

A girl in one particular YouTube video really struck a nerve.

""She was a young girl who was battling cancer, and she was completely bald. I was just like, 'Oh, my, how is she so young and so brave to come on camera in a public place?' So I just decided to challenge myself and do the thing that scares me the most.""

Shalom started making her own YouTube videos. Without makeup, she let the world see her as she is, scars and all.

""I just decided to do a video and then post a picture of me without my wig, which was a big deal. I was so scared, but seeing people tell me how my picture or my videos have inspired them really pushed me to do more and share with people.""

Shalom Blac is known for her transformative makeup videos on YouTube and Instagram.

YouTube sensation

Shalom's transformation videos, in which she demonstrates how she uses makeup to change her looks, went viral. People were not only amazed by her beauty expertise but by her bravery and confidence.

""I wanted to stop feeling sorry for myself. And I didn't want people to feel sorry for me. I wanted to be happy.""

Now, she's helping others by sharing her tips and performing makeovers for other burn survivors.

But her main goal is to help others see what she has now found for herself: the beauty inside.

246,246,2018-06-24 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Carson City, Nevada (CNN) Dennis Hof, the Nevada brothel owner who just days ago ousted a Republican state lawmaker in a primary, is already workshopping new campaign themes for the general election.

Over a plate of ribs and chicken fingers at Living the Good Life, a diner and lounge in Carson City, Hof complains about state tax hikes, local efforts to outlaw prostitution and government grabs for landowners' water and more.

""Here's what I'm thinking: Make Nevada Nevada Again,"" he tells CNN.

Sound familiar?

Hof, the 71-year-old star of HBO's ""Cathouse"" series and Republican nominee for Nevada's 36th District in the State Assembly, is fashioning himself as the ""Trump from Pahrump."" He's a brash candidate who courts the kind of controversy and attention other politicians seek to avoid. And he says his career in politics is all possible because of Donald Trump.

""This is the new breed of politicians because of what Donald Trump has done. He's opened that door. Before this, who would have ever elected somebody who said, on tape, 'Grab 'em by the pussy'? Nobody ever would do that,"" Hof says.

Now, he says, voters seem to have decided, ""I'd rather have that than the guy that's going to lie to me and raise my taxes and sell me out to the special interests.""

Just like Trump in 2016, Hof's candidacy is forcing Republicans to grapple with uncomfortable realities about their party's restive base in Nevada, which is a swing state in presidential years and one of the nation's most important in 2018's midterm elections. The governor's office, a key Senate seat and two competitive House seats are on the ballot.

Nevada GOP chairman Michael McDonald, meanwhile, has been an ally, Hof says, pointing to a letter McDonald wrote lambasting Hof's then-opponent, Republican state Assemblyman James Oscarson, for his conduct during the primary.

Hof says he believes Republicans who don't back him could face backlash from rural, white voters in areas like Nye County, where several of his brothels are located. Huge margins of victory in those counties are crucial for Republicans in statewide elections, when the party's candidates need those votes to make up for losses in the Democratic stronghold of Clark County, the home of Las Vegas. And Hof has the support of some Nevada evangelical leaders , who are important drivers of Republican turnout.

A 'flamboyant, loud-mouthed guy'

Hof says he was inspired to run for office by Trump's candidacy.

""I'm riding the Trump wave,"" he says. ""He's Christopher Columbus.""

Both had reality television shows and books. Hof admits to cribbing his title, ""The Art of the Pimp,"" from Trump.

What the two have in common, Hof says, is a ""can't buy him, can't break him"" approach to politics. Both entered the arena late in life, already wealthy and with no real ties to corporate donors or lobbyists outside their own business interests.

""I'm not afraid of anything,"" Hof says. ""I'm a brothel owner. I'm a rebel.""

But the similarities go farther.

Trump starts his mornings by turning on ""Fox and Friends"" and taking to Twitter. Hof spends his evenings watching the Fox News shows of Tucker Carlson -- who he says he's known for 15 years and texts most days after Carlson's show -- and Sean Hannity.

Hof calls Roger Stone, the flamboyant Richard Nixon veteran who has at times been close with Trump, the head of his campaign. He says Stone has urged him to use the legislature to ""get your feet wet"" ahead of a future run for governor, and wonders whether Trump -- or, in Hof's words, ""The Man"" -- has blessed the idea.

And Hof calls himself a ""flamboyant, loud-mouth guy.""

Hof, like Trump, faced accusations of sexual assault during his campaign . Two former prostitutes alleged he sexually assaulted them several years ago. Hof has denied those allegations and says they are part of a smear campaign against him, and prosecutors did not pursue charges, citing the statute of limitations.

Much like Trump, who was known to tip off the New York tabloids, Hof's penchant for controversy is a marketing strategy. Nevada law severely restricts advertising for brothels, so Hof relies heavily on press coverage.

Much of it, Hof admits, is a ""PT Barnum"" act -- such as in 2012, when he launched a ""Pimpin' for Paul"" campaign to have visitors at his Moonlite BunnyRanch brothel donate to Ron Paul's presidential campaign.

It was a ""gigantic media score,"" he says.

'It's gonna be just like Trump'

Hof says he decided to try to take down three-term Oscarson after Oscarson in 2015 backed Gov. Brian Sandoval's package of tax hikes, including a new ""commerce tax"" on businesses that make more than $4 million per year.

""It just pissed me off,"" Hof says.

First, he tried as a Libertarian -- taking 39% of the vote against Oscarson in the 2016 general election. In 2018, he ran again, this time as a Republican running with Grover Norquist's support, and took 43% of the primary vote to Oscarson's 36%.

It's a deep red district, and though Democrats are fielding a candidate in school principal Lesia Romanov, Hof is heavily favored to win.

Hof acknowledges Trump's agenda has hit roadblocks on Capitol Hill, and that the transition from brawling businessman to member of a legislative body wouldn't be easy.

""It's gonna be just like Trump -- frustrating as hell,"" Hof says.

Hof says he's now working on selling a documentary series on his campaign. The working title: ""The Art of the Pimp: From Prostitutes to Politics, Where the Real Whores Are.""

He also says he wishes he could out ""these dirty SOBs"" in the legislature who are customers at his brothels.

And Hof says -- for irony's sake -- he wants to buy an aging hotel across from the state capitol and turn it into a brothel.

""One whorehouse on one side of the street. And the biggest whorehouse, the legislature, on the other side of the street,"" he says. ""People get it. They know they're whores.""","'I'm riding the Trump wave.

248,248,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Late-night comics like Samantha Bee, Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel and Bill Maher have all generated controversy, to varying degrees, by being blunt and outspoken about the Trump administration.

Jimmy Fallon -- who has largely sought to stay out of that fray -- has discovered that in the current climate, there's a price to be paid for comedic timidity as well.

""The Tonight Show"" host became the unlikely target of a presidential tweet on Sunday, when President Trump -- apparently responding to delayed coverage of a Fallon interview conducted by the Hollywood Reporter -- said that the host is ""now whimpering"" about the criticism he received for tousling then-candidate Donald Trump's hair during a September 2016 appearance.

For Fallon, becoming the target of the president's ire feels a bit like adding insult to injury, to the extent that unlike his late-night rivals, he has fastidiously sought to continue making a light, funny show, and in the process, seen his claim to ratings supremacy dramatically diminished.

Since Trump's inauguration, ""The Tonight Show"" has gone from the clear leader to trailing ""Late Show With Stephen Colbert"" by a wide margin in total viewers -- 3.8 million to 2.7 million, according Nielsen data, for the September-through-May TV season. Because Fallon appeals to an audience that's likely somewhat less attuned to politics, he has maintained an edge in the young-adult demographics used primarily to negotiate ad buys, but even that gap has significantly narrowed.

249,249,2018-04-11 00:00:00,cnn.com,"It's our emotional intelligence that gives us the ability to read our instinctive feelings and those of others. It also allows us to understand and label emotions as well as express and regulate them, according to Yale University's Marc Brackett.

Most of us would probably like to think that we can do all of the above. We spot and understand emotions in ourselves and others and label them accurately in order to guide our thoughts and actions.

But many of us tend to overestimate our own emotional intelligence, according to Brackett, a professor in the Child Study Center at Yale and founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence.

That's important because experts say the ability to read, understand and respond to emotions in ourselves and other people is a crucial factor in predicting our health, happiness and personal and professional success.

So maybe we all need to take a breath and invest a little more time in schooling ourselves on what it means to be emotionally intelligent.

Understanding emotional intelligence

The theory of emotional intelligence -- and the term itself -- originated at Yale and the University of New Hampshire. Peter Salovey, the 23rd president of Yale University, and John ""Jack"" Mayer, professor of psychology at the University of New Hampshire, wrote up the theory in 1990, Brackett said.

Their work demonstrated how emotions had a marked impact on an individual's thinking and behavior, said Robin Stern, associate director for the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and an educator, author and licensed psychoanalyst.

Experts have continued to build on that framework to refine definitions of what exactly is at the core of of emotional intelligence. ""Emotional intelligence is being smart about your feelings. It's how to use your emotions to inform your thinking and use your thinking to inform your emotions,"" she said.

It's having an awareness of how your emotions drive your decisions and behaviors so you can effectively engage with and influence others, said Sara Canaday, a leadership speaker and author. Individuals who are emotionally intelligent tend to be empathetic, can look at situations from an alternative point of view, are considered open-minded, bounce back from challenges and pursue their goals despite any obstacles they might face, according to Canaday.

""Some people think of emotional intelligence as a soft skill or the ability or the tendency to be nice. It's really about understanding what is going on for you in the moment so that you can make conscious choices about how you want to use your emotions and how you want to manage yourself and how you want to be seen in the world,"" Stern said.

""People with more emotional intelligence are healthier, happier and more effective,"" Brackett said.

Why it matters

Canaday further suggests that emotional intelligence is a better predictor of career success than an impressive résumé or a high IQ score.

Wait, really?

Well ... just reflect on your own work experiences, Canaday suggests.

Has anyone you worked with ever been let go or asked to leave, even when they had the competency or technical skills for the job?

""We might be hired for technical talents, but we are often fired because we lack emotional intelligence,"" Canaday said.

Individuals with a low level of emotional intelligence can be successful, she said, but she argues that those individuals could be even more successful if they had a higher level of emotional intelligence.

""It is how well you can collaborate, how well you engage with others and influence. It's the stories you can tell, the way you can bring data to life in a way that connects with others. Those are the things that are going to set you apart.""

Testing emotional intelligence

Behavioral scientists have created a number of emotional intelligence self-assessments, usually broken down into ""your ability to manage yourself, your ability to manage relationships, your self-awareness and your social awareness,"" according to Canaday.

Your results will be measured along with others who have taken the assessment to give some indication of where you fall on the spectrum from low to high emotional intelligence.

But Brackett warns that ""measurement is a tricky subject.""

In his early research, he found that people tend to overestimate their emotional intelligence, which is why he believes you must measure it through performance assessments. In a performance assessment, people are required to problem-solve; they must decode facial expressions or strategize in an emotionally tense situation. That way, their knowledge and skills can be tested as opposed to their beliefs about them.

Another form of an emotional intelligence test is a ""360 assessment.""

In the workplace setting, a 360 assessment is a process involving feedback from colleagues and supervisors evaluating a person emotional intelligence. Canaday believes that we often ""see ourselves differently than others do.""

When a coworker takes the 360 assessment of you it provides an opportunity to compare it to your self-assessment. Another way to take a 360 assessment without undergoing a formal test is to ask a trusted adviser, perhaps a current or former boss, to evaluate your emotional intelligence, she said.

But, Canaday cautions, If you ask for someone's feedback, be prepared to accept what they share. ""This stuff can feel very personal. On one han,d we say we want to learn and grow, but on the other hand, we want to be accepted just the way we are, and those two human traits run counter.""

Can I improve my emotional intelligence?

So maybe you need to improve your emotional intelligence. How do you do that?

From the earliest ages, children should be taught how to recognize their emotions, understand what those emotions mean and label them accurately in order to to express and manage themselves, Stern stern.

For adults who did not receive a solid education on emotional intelligence, improving will require some hard work. Canaday suggests creating an action plan including specific goals. ""Pick one or two areas where you want to grow, and get some advice on how to best start to embody whatever factor of emotional intelligence you are trying to develop.""

If you are trying to gain better control of your anger, for example, you might find a healthy outlet for it -- whether it be yoga, meditation or boxing.

Canaday also suggests seeking out perspectives from those who may not agree with you. ""Be intentional about that. Take active steps to do that. If you constantly surround yourself with people who believe just like you do, then you are hearing the same conversations, and you are not growing, and you are not learning to be open to perspectives.""

Brackett advises seeking out strategies that are effective for managing emotions. Practice them and then evaluate how those strategies are working for you. It's important to ""spend time reflecting on and thinking about your influence and how people respond to your emotions, be more self- and socially aware about your presence.""

Stern suggests prolonging the time between when you are triggered by something and when you respond. Pause, slow down and take a deep breath. Imagine what your best self looks like. Taking the time to pause and think about what your best self would do in each situation may help you avoid letting your emotions control you. You are allowing yourself time to manage your emotions.

How we talk to ourselves can also have a huge impact on our emotions and our health if that self-talk is not positive, Stern says. She suggests that we would never talk to another individual the way we often talk to ourselves.

251,251,2018-06-18 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Adana, Turkey (CNN) Quarrels between men end when a woman throws her headscarf on the ground, according to Turkish tradition.

So presidential candidate Meral Aksener is going from town to town collecting these colorful pieces of cloth, known as ""yemeni,"" from her supporters.

The 61-year-old is leading what she calls the yemeni revolution to bring an end to the aggression of Turkish politics. If she becomes the one to finally end President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's long reign, she will put the headscarves on display in Cankaya, the former presidential palace in Ankara.

""Turkey has been ruled by a very harsh male for a very long time,"" she told CNN in the southern city of Adana, on the campaign trail.

Some abroad call Aksener Turkey's Iron Lady, but others at home call her Asena, a mythical blue she-wolf that led Turkic tribes away from danger. But there are other names she prefers.

Presidential candidate Meral Aksener describes herself as a mother-like figure in Turkish politics.

""Some people call me sister, but there are many young people who call me 'Mother Meral,' and I like being a mother,"" Aksener said.

Aksener is the only woman running for president in the June 24 elections, but her appeal is not based solely on her gender. Her conservative and longtime nationalist credentials are what make her most likely to lure support from Erdogan's base, even though she polls third.

The main opposition candidate, Muharrem Ince, is in second place and has galvanized his own center-left base. But he is unlikely to split the conservative vote in the way Aksener can.

Aksener's rise

Aksener and her envisaged revolution have been drawing crowds across Turkey. Women at the Adana rally eagerly handed their headscarves up to the candidate on stage.

Esra Demirkol, a fervent supporter who waited for hours to get a photo, jumped on stage to hug the candidate.

""For the future, for our kids, for our country for many reasons, I will vote for Meral Aksener. A woman's touch makes everything better. I want a mother to rule our country,"" said a breathless Demirkol as she returned from stage.

Aksener's Iyi Party (Good Party) is new to the political scene, but Aksener is a veteran politician. She served as interior minister for eight months at the height of the dirty war against Kurdish separatists when human-rights abuses were rampant in Turkey.

When questioned about those allegations, Aksener is defiant, claiming there was not a single human-rights violation by the government during her time as minister.

""There was a human rights group at those times, they were publishing lists for missing people. I sent them a signed paper saying, 'Let us search for your missing together.' And they did not have any other publications for the rest of my ministry period,"" she said.

But during her stint as interior minister, she also gained credibilty for standing up to the military, which tried to overthrow the civilian government in the 1997 so-called ""post-modern coup.""

Once again, it is her defiance that is fueling her popularity -- Aksener broke with her longtime Nationalist Movement Party, MHP, last year over its alliance with the President.

'We do not have checks and balances'

Aksener, like all the opposition candidates, has vowed to roll back a change to Turkey's political system that Erdogan won last year in a referendum.

He was widely accused of a power grab with the vote, in which he sought to change the country's parliamentary system to an executive presidential one, giving himself sweeping new powers.

The vote was seen as unfair, as his government has imprisoned dissidents and crushed the free media following a failed coup in 2016. He won by a narrow margin, and a radical change to Turkey's system will come into effect after the election.

""I have been struggling with Erdogan and his extrajudicial behavior for the last two-and-a-half, three years,"" Aksener said.

""The elections we are going into, it is what Erdogan wants. It is not a presidential system as in Western democracies. We do not have checks and balances.""

A supporter listens to Aksener speaking at a rally in Gaziantep, Turkey.

With Ince polling second, Aksener may not be the opposition candidate to face off against Erdogan, should the vote go to a run-off round.

But she has already been instrumental in shaping this election. In the previous presidential vote, opposition parties banded together to back a single candidate to challenge the incumbent. This time around, Aksener refused to join and announced her own candidacy. Soon other opposition parties followed and put forward their strongest candidates, giving more options for people to vote against Erdogan.

Opposition parties including Aksener's have committed to support whoever faces off with Erdogan, should the vote go to a second round.

People from the small southern town of Samandag welcome Aksener on the street.

Mustafa Koseler, a 76-year-old supporter of MHP, Aksener's former party, will back the Iyi Party after decades of loyalty. He fears that Turkey will end up a ""one-man dictatorship like Bashar Assad, like Hafez Assad, like (Mohamed) Morsy, like (Moammar) Gadhafi"" under Erdogan's rule. He is looking to Aksener to preserve the country's democracy and prevent the change to Turkey's political system.

""We do not want one-man rule,"" he said at the rally in Adana. ""We want our republic, democracy and parliament to function as it is today. We want our members of parliament to have a say. In the new system, they won't.""

What Aksener is promising is a new dawn for her country. Her Iyi Party's blue logo is emblazoned with a golden sun, promising the optimism of a new movement.

When voter Guler Yasa in Adana is asked why she supports Aksener, she refers to this logo.

""Because she is turning her face to the sun. She will make a new sun rise over our country,"" Yasa said.",Meral Aksener: The mother figure taking on Turkey's Erdogan,http://cnn.com/2018/06/18/europe/turkish-elections-meral-aksener-intl/index.html
252,252,2018-05-23 00:00:00,cnn.com,"La Jolla, California (CNN) To face each day, Claire Wineland undergoes hours of breathing treatments. It's a reality of living with cystic fibrosis she's come to accept.

But last month, as the nebulizer hummed loudly in her La Jolla, California, hotel room, she breathed in medicine through her mask and hoped this day would be the first step toward something different.

She'd traveled from Los Angeles with her mother, her best friend and her pit bull, Daisy, who flopped down on the floor atop one of Claire's ever-present oxygen tubes. A full day of appointments at a nearby medical center awaited her, when she would begin the evaluation process to see whether she might be a candidate for a double-lung transplant.

A year earlier, Claire vowed that she'd never have the major surgery.

""It's not for me and never has been,"" she said at the time.

She was more comfortable dealing with the illness she knew than taking on the unknown. She preferred to focus on leading a purposeful life than worrying about death and how to dodge it.

Claire Wineland sits in her hotel room with dog Daisy before heading to evaluations at the Center for Transplantation at UC San Diego Health.

A series of irreversible setbacks and some painful soul-searching, however, have prompted an about-face in her thinking. Claire, 21, needs new lungs, or she will die -- sooner than she's willing to accept.

The only question is: Did her change of heart come too late?

Feeling trapped

It wasn't as if the clouds parted and she suddenly saw the light. Claire's new outlook was the result of a messy and humbling self-reckoning.

She had long managed to push through physical discomfort to lead a life that mattered. After emerging from a 16-day medically induced coma at age 13, she envisioned the Claire's Place Foundation , which today provides financial support to struggling families affected by cystic fibrosis. She appeared in brutally honest viral videos in which she talked about topics like death and did it with a smile. Since she was 14, she had been taking to stages and wowing audiences with beyond-her-years wisdom. Along the way, she nurtured a love of travel.

She was wrapping up a three-city tour last fall when pneumonia landed her in a Philadelphia hospital for two weeks.

Doctors there sat her down and told Claire she had to stop flying. Period. They told her that her lungs could collapse and that she ran the risk of dropping dead on a plane, she said. They warned that it would be painful and laid out what it would feel like if an air pocket in her lungs burst.

""You will feel like you're being stabbed to death ... and then blood will stop flowing to your brain,"" she remembered them saying. ""And I was like, 'OK, I got the message! Copy that!' ""

She took a three-day train ride home and began to settle down.

Because her body works so hard to breathe, Claire must take in about 5,000 calories a day and relies on a feeding tube to absorb calories while she sleeps.

Cystic fibrosis affects more than 30,000 people in the United States (and more than 70,000 worldwide), according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation . The disease causes an overabundance of mucus, which traps infections and blocks airways in the lungs, complicates digestion, affects the pancreas and other organs and, eventually, leads to respiratory failure.

The median survival age is about 40, according to the foundation -- a great improvement from the 1950s, when surviving long enough to attend elementary school was rare.

Claire became uber-diligent with her care. She was on top of her dozens of medications, including her shots for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, endured as best she could the feeding tube at night, even though it made her throw up, and spent extra time with her breathing treatments. For four hours daily, she said, she wore a vest to shake her lungs and loosen mucus. She also tried supplements like turmeric and found comfort in the nettle infusions she drank throughout the day.

But even with all of this, her lung function continued to decline. In one year, she said her working lung capacity fell 10 points -- from 35% to 25%. Short walks and visits to the beach left this lover of the outdoors exhausted. Simple grocery shopping became too tough to manage. She had no energy for local speaking engagements and lost her income flow. She felt homebound, trapped and unable to do what mattered to her most.

CFers, as she refers to people with cystic fibrosis, often talk about ""the Wheelchair Decision"" with dread, Claire said. But when breathing and getting around became too difficult and she got hers in February, it initially felt ""like freedom.""

With her best friend, Larissa, taking on the role of ""designated wheeler,"" the duo could tool around outside. The day she got the wheelchair, they went on a seven-hour adventure around Los Angeles' Venice Beach, where Claire lives, visiting the canals, going to the park, soaking in the ocean breeze.

And while most of the time, she has no qualms about needing a wheelchair, there are accessibility issues, the sidewalks are a mess, and she can't be pushed through sand. Inevitably, she's had those moments when she thinks, ""It sucks that I need this. It's painful that it's gotten this far.""

Claire breathes in medicine through a nebulizer as Larissa pounds her back with cupped hands to help loosen mucus in her airways.

Then Claire, who's undergone more than 30 surgeries and been in the hospital a quarter of her life, received another jolt during a March hospital stay. Medical staff discovered that her portacath wasn't working. The small dome under the skin of her chest provides a central line into a vein, allowing easy administration of IV treatments -- such as antibiotics, which she must take regularly to beat back constant infections. A portacath replacement means surgery, and Claire's pulmonary function was -- and remains -- at a level too dangerous for her to go under anesthesia.

Though the portacath was fixable, Claire didn't know it would be at the time. A wave of terror washed over her. She fell apart and realized it was time to take the transplant idea seriously.

""I can't go under anesthesia. I can't fly. I can't do anything,"" she remembered feeling with a panic. ""I have completely locked myself in a position of not being able to do anything besides die.""

Ready for the race

After leaving the La Jolla hotel, Claire was wheeled into the Center for Transplantation at UC San Diego Health, prepared to meet with members of the lung transplant team.

She'd eaten a McDonald's McGriddle sandwich the day before -- a secret she employs to put on an extra pound or two before weigh-ins -- just in case they asked her and her 95-pound frame to step on a scale. She was armed with questions and a notepad, ready to studiously record all she'd learn. Since she'd been here less than two years earlier and decided against pursuing the transplant path then, she was eager to tell them why this time was different.

A nurse who serves as the lung transplant coordinator, Megan Serletti, spent several hours educating Claire, her mom and Larissa about the process.

Megan Serletti, top, a nurse who works as a lung transplant coordinator, leads Claire and her mom, Melissa Nordquist Yeager, into the transplantation center.

They talked about the battery of tests that would determine whether she would qualify to get on the waiting list, some of which Claire knew well and described as ""gnarly."" They discussed the lung allocation score, the number Claire will get if she's approved that measures how sick she is and determines where she sits on the priority list.

They discussed what life on a waitlist looks like: the necessity that she stay within a four-hour drive of the center, the importance of not ignoring phone calls, the exercise she'd need to grow stronger and the multitude of blood draws and exams she'd have on her schedule.

""We call a transplant your marathon,"" Serletti said. ""We tell people to train for your marathon. The day you get called is the day of the race.""

There were forms to sign and questions she'd need to consider. For example, would she be willing to accept lungs from a prostitute?

""I'm fine if a donor had sex in exchange for money,"" Claire quipped. ""Way to bring the hustle.""

How about from someone who was an IV drug user and contracted hepatitis C, a condition that is treatable?

""Honestly, I'd just laugh if I got new lungs and caught something else,"" she said. ""I already have the body of someone who's been around the block.""

Serletti spoke of the realities after surgery, including the drugs Claire would need to take for the rest of her life, the physical and emotional challenges she might face, the changes in lifestyle she'd have to honor.

Claire wrote everything down. She curled her legs into the chair, revealing the tattoo on her left ankle: the thumbs-up ""Don't Panic"" logo from ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.""

""None of it spooked me,"" Claire said afterward, over lunch in the transplantation center's courtyard. ""Now that I'm looking at it as something I have to do, I don't care about any of the side effects. I'm willing to deal with anything.""

'We both just started crying'

To qualify for new lungs, a person must be sick enough to need a transplant yet strong enough to withstand the surgery and recovery.

There were 1,436 candidates for lung transplants as of April 20, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing , which manages the nation's organ waiting lists. Of those, 122 had a primary diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Last year, of the total 2,449 lung transplants performed, CFers accounted for nearly 11% of the recipients.

Unlike previous introductory meetings, when her heart wasn't in it, Claire takes in every word during this education session about lung transplants.

A lung transplant is not a cure, but it can extend a life, if all goes well.

Of those who received lung transplants (not just CFers), dating to 2000, an average of 84% survived after one year, nearly 54% survived five years, and slightly more than 30% survived 10 years or more, according to the organ sharing network's data.

Deciding to go for a lung transplant, let alone a double-lung transplant (the only option for CFers), is no small matter.

Claire first visited a transplantation center at UCLA when she was 14 but said that was too early for the idea to make sense for her. At 17, she checked out the program at Stanford University but was turned down, her mom explained, because they could tell that Claire wasn't interested. She checked out the option again, at the very place she had returned to now, when she was 19.

While her peers were being tasked with picking out prom dresses or decorating dorm rooms, she was being asked to contemplate her mortality.

She prayed that she'd want it as much as she knew her parents and doctors did, but her heart wasn't in it, she said. She was still happy with what she had and, as an adult, able to make her own decisions.

Her parents, who split up when Claire was 3, struggled to make peace with her choice.

""Just think of it as insurance, even if you don't want to do it,"" her mother, Melissa Nordquist Yeager, pleaded at first. ""Get on the list so you can change your mind.""

But ever since she'd been a small child, Claire had a sense of self, an understanding of her condition and a sort of intuition Yeager needed to trust -- even if it made her uncomfortable.

Her dad, John Wineland, said Claire ""has a relationship with her body that is sacred"" and described his daughter's thinking: ""This is the body I came in with. This is the body I'm going out with.""

And as her parent, he said, ""I have to live with it.""

To see her struggle and deteriorate over the past year was both sobering and excruciating for them. So when Claire broke down and said she'd changed her mind, they were thrilled, excited and terrified.

""I was blown away, so grateful, happy and hopeful. It was a sign that she wasn't willing to give up,"" remembered Yeager, who was with Claire at the hospital in March and heard the news first.

""I called her dad, and we both just started crying,"" Yeager said.

""I'm just praying my ass off, really, that everything goes smoothly, that she can get a shot at more time on the planet,"" Claire's dad said. ""There are a lot of hoops she has to jump through to be accepted.""

'Are you ready?'

It's not uncommon for CFers to change their minds about transplant, social worker Leslie Fijolek assured Claire.

Fijolek, who serves on the transplant team, remembered Claire from the last time she visited UC San Diego Health. Fijolek's job is to think about ""who are these [new] lungs going to live with,"" she said, get a sense of the care system recipients have in place and provide support to make the process successful for everyone involved.

Is Claire compliant in taking her medications? Is she prepared to relocate near the transplantation center, where she'll need to be for at least three months after the transplant if she gets one? Who'd move with her and drive her to appointments?

""How's your mood been? Any depression and anxiety?"" Fijolek asked.

Leslie Fijolek, a social worker, asks Claire hard questions to see whether she's prepared to take on what a transplant would mean.

Claire mentioned how her decline, starting last fall, threw her into a depression. They talked about how she'd lost the ability to manage her physical decline, how she'd like to find a therapist who works with patients facing chronic illness, how she turns to arts and crafts projects to get out of bed -- and out of her head -- on rough days.

Photos on a cell phone are passed around, showing the papier-mache tree she's been working on and how the bark and surrounding foliage are remarkably true to life.

Fijolek turned serious, locked eyes with Claire and said what everyone in the room already understood: ""You know you need a transplant.""

""I was so young. I was so naïve,"" Claire answered, describing where she was before. ""All the side effects used to scare the shit out of me. My relationship to transplant and all it entails has changed.""

Fijolek, who was all too familiar with Claire's past ambivalence, pushed her further.

""Let's say you got listed in about two weeks; it means you can get a call at any time,"" she said. ""Are you ready?""

Claire assured her she is.

""It's a big change from where you were,"" the social worker said.

""I didn't want to waste anyone's time,"" Claire answered.

Her mother sat by, fanning herself with a medical brochure, listened and wiped a tear from her eye.

All she had

The last appointment of the day was with one of the transplant team's pulmonologists.

Dr. Kamyar Afshar explains the importance of Claire building her strength so she can handle the transplant, if she's given one.

Dr. Kamyar Afshar got down to the nitty gritty. He wanted to know what antibiotics still worked for her, how many bowel movements she has a day and the last time she coughed up blood.

""Two days ago,"" she told him. ""It's usually one or two times a month.""

He prescribed walks every day to build up her endurance and suggested she increase her continuous oxygen flow from her normal 2 liters per minute to 6 liters per minute when exercising. He looked down at her worn Birkenstocks and said, ""Your shoes will have to change.""

The doctor cranked up her oxygen and told her that if she wanted to get a transplant, she'd need to be able to do 15 sits-to-stands in a minute. He said this was non-negotiable. She won't be able to use her arms after the surgery to get up from a chair or bed, he explained.

He asked her to climb off the exam table and show him some squats.

Claire -- who used to do yoga six days a week, loved to swim and even went through a phase when she did difficult workout videos like P90X with her dad -- crossed her arms in front of her chest and showed the doctor all she had.

For the first time that day, her cheeks had color.

""I don't anticipate you'd be on the list for too long,"" Afshar blurted out.

Given her blood type and her condition, he said, she'd probably get a transplant within three months of being approved -- if she's approved.

The first full day of evaluation appoitnments complete, Claire and her mom breathe sighs of overwhelmed relief.

Claire's eyes opened wide, and her mom appeared to melt into her chair. Suddenly, it seemed real.

""Three months!"" Yeager said outside the center. ""That made me want to throw up a little bit.""

""I'm a little overwhelmed,"" Claire said. ""I need to go back to the hotel and binge-watch 'Real Housewives.' I want to see white women fight over nothingness.""

Hoping for a chance

The truth is, according to Claire, not longing for different lungs for most of her life served her well.

She was able to ""work with what I had in front of me,"" she said, rather than fixate on what she didn't have. She also suppressed that part of herself that might have simply dreamed of something more.

""If I had told myself things could be better than they are now, I think I would have driven myself crazy with frustration and jealousy over other people's lives,"" she said.

In changing her mind, she said she had to swallow some of her pride and ""open this floodgate of emotion that I kept really deeply buried.""

A slew of tests still awaited Claire, but she was now all in. She had opened herself up to the possibility that life -- for her -- could be different and not as challenging.

""For the first time ever, I'm going there, and it's really scary,"" she said. ""Now that I actually want something better, what if it doesn't happen? What if I don't get it? What if it goes wrong?""

The trees -- located in Zimbabwe, Namibia, South Africa, Botswana and Zambia -- have died completely, or partly, according to the study. Some of them dated back to the times of the ancient Greeks.

Researchers found that nine of the oldest 13 baobab trees and five of the six biggest ones have partially or completely perished in the past 12 years.

The baobab tree, often referred to as the ""tree of life"" for its ability to produce nutrient-rich fruit even during Africa's harsh dry season, can live to be 3,000 years old, and can grow as wide as the length of a bus. In the past, they have been used as a prison, a barn and a bus shelter, according to the website of Kruger National Park in South Africa

The Chapman baobab tree in Botswana, which collapsed in 2016.

When they've lost their leaves, the trees appear to be upside-down, with their branches resembling roots that extend upward. Given their age and their resilience to the often-harsh weather conditions in Africa, they have been the source of local stories and legends.

Two of the six men have been arrested and charged, while police said they are looking for the other four. A man who helps run a school in the village also has been arrested and charged in connection with abetting the attack.

Police said the attack took place Tuesday in Kochang village in Khunti district in the state of Jharkhand, the same region where two teens were raped and then set on fire last month.

The anti-trafficking activists who were raped have been discharged from a hospital and are being kept in a safe house, police said. The women have been given police protection and trauma counseling.

The five women were performing a street play with three men on the issue of human trafficking when armed men on bikes disrupted the performance.

258,258,2018-06-24 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) The following contains spoilers about the ""Westworld"" season 2 finale.

""Westworld"" closed a chaotic second season with a finale that encapsulated it -- combining operatic highs, thoughtful dialogue and time-bending twists. The ungainly mix of those elements, however, has made the HBO series near-impenetrable -- a show that's alternately too blood-soaked, convoluted and cerebral to keep its elaborate machinery running smoothly.

The 90-minute episode, written by producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, felt like an effort to provide closure on some fronts while hitting the reset button on others, and benefited from drawing together several key characters who had been scattered throughout the year. But in terms of heightening interest in Season 3, for this critic -- who has come to view watching the show with a greater sense of obligation than enthusiasm -- the finale's big swings didn't hit it out of the park.

If the first season dealt with the dawning consciousness of the robot hosts -- after having been cruelly exploited as the playthings of the human guests -- the second moved into a new phase, as those characters pursued their independence and rebelled.

Too many detours and digressions, however, made the series less compelling -- and more significantly, reduced the incentive to invest the time and brain power seemingly required to contemplate its various turns, beginning with the reams of analysis and speculation devoted to them.

259,259,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) More than 11,200 calls concerning children's exposure to buprenorphine, an opioid medication used to treat opioid use disorder, were made to US poison control centers from 2007 to 2016, a new study found. Eighty-six percent of the exposures were in children below the age of 6; 89% of the exposures were unintentional.

""This is never prescribed for children under 6. It is a significant risk to them,"" said Henry Spiller, director of the Central Ohio Poison Center and an author of the study, published Monday in the journal Pediatrics . ""We're not quite sure why it stands out so much. Perhaps the parents who have this may not think it's as risky as their other opiates because it doesn't have the big effect that the other opiates do for them,"" he said, in reference to the medication being left out or within reach of children who then try it.

Experts view these numbers as an unintended consequence of medical therapy being provided to those who need it, said Dr. Jason Kane, an associate professor of pediatrics and critical care at University of Chicago Medicine Comer Children's Hospital.

Among the 11,275 children exposed, the overall exposure rate per 1 million increased by 215.6% from 2007 to 2010 (from 6.4 to 20.2), followed by a 42.6% decline from 2010 to 11.6 in 2013, before increasing by 8.6% to 12.6 in 2016.

""This is not the first study to show these data, but it is the latest study to show a medication whose design it is to help adults with narcotic or opioid addiction is ending up poisoning, mostly unintentionally, children and in particular those who are most vulnerable,"" said Kane, who was not involved in the new research but led a recent study that found the number of opioid overdoses among children had nearly doubled since 2004.

Buprenorphine is both a stimulant of opiate receptors and a blocker, explained Spiller, who is also a diplomat of the American Board of Toxicology. As a result, it does not provide the same ""high"" that other opiates do, but it is still an opiate.

""In adults, the respiratory depression, the part that slows the breathing and you stop breathing, is limited, and so there's a lot less respiratory depression in adults,"" Spiller said. ""That's why it was felt to be safer. Unfortunately, in very young children under 5, preschoolers, toddlers, infants ... that protection isn't there, and they do get this respiratory depression. It does affect their breathing.""

Adolescents may not have the same risk as 5-year-olds, but they aren't immune, he added. ""Real significant effects are additive. They get worse when you start adding in things like alcohol, maybe another drug, other things.""

In fact, though adolescents made up just 11% of total exposures, 77% of those exposures were intentional (with 12% suspected suicides), and more than 25% used buprenorphine with at least one other substance, according to the study.

""It was surprising that adolescents were actually using it for abuse. It's very specific,"" Spiller said. ""You have to be in a program to get this. It's carefully managed. It's not widely available. ... It is available on the street, but essentially, the majority of this is from these management programs and someone's in therapy, someone in the house, them or a family member.""

Though more than 60% of the buprenorphine abuse and/or misuse was in male adolescents, female adolescents accounted for almost 60% of the suspected suicides within this group, the authors note.

""In adolescents, there's a risk where we start to see an increased risk of suicide attempts, just as a part of adolescence,"" Spiller said. ""But if this is in the home, this is a really potent drug. They may attempt to add this in or use this as whatever drug they're using for suicide attempts.""

The study's authors expect that with about 2.1 million people in the United States having an opioid use disorder and 11.5 million misusing prescription opioids, the number of children and adolescents who are exposed to buprenorphine will continue to rise.

""You'd be hiding under a rock if you didn't realize there's a big opioid crisis going on, and this is one of the treatments for that addiction,"" Spiller said. ""A number of these programs are trying to expand to accommodate a lot of these opiate-addicted patients, so I would expect to see more of this.""

Nearly a quarter of the children under 6 who are exposed spend time in intensive care, Kane noted.

""This burden we're putting in the health care system is entirely preventable,"" he said. ""These are children who do not need a hospital if not but for the fact that they were accidentally poisoned by medications that were not designed to be taken by them.""

The study's authors recommend exposure prevention aligned with the children's age group. For example, manufacturing unit-dose packaging instead of an entire bottle of pills would help prevent unintentional exposure among young children, while locking medications away on a shelf can help keep teenagers out.

The approval of a buprenorphine subcutaneous implant in 2016 may also reduce children's access, the study noted because the patients with an implant would not have pills for children to get into.

Other suggestions include disposing of any unused medications, keeping child-proof caps on containers and leaving medications in their properly labeled boxes or bottles, Kane said.

""Seven children under the age of 6 died as a result of an accidental poisoning from this drug, which was present in someone's home, prescribed with the goal of making someone else better,"" Kane said adding, ""that's a striking thing for me.""","Kids' exposure to addiction drug rose 215% in three years, study says",http://cnn.com/2018/06/25/health/buprenorphine-children-poison-control-calls-study/index.html

261,261,2018-06-20 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Washington (CNN) North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ended a celebratory visit to China's President Xi Jinping on Wednesday with tea, praise, handshakes -- and a message for the US.

Amid lingering questions over Pyongyang's willingness to denuclearize and an escalating trade war between the US and China, Kim's trip reinforced the idea that Beijing remains a key player -- a variable that President Donald Trump needs and yet one that remains outside his control.

Administration officials have said that they will maintain sanctions on North Korea even as talks continue, and stand ready to intensify that economic pressure should Pyongyang fail to cooperate. But China, North Korea's biggest trading partner, ultimately has power over whether sanctions on Pyongyang truly bite.

With tensions climbing between Beijing and Washington over trade, some analysts point to the warmth on display during Kim's visit to Beijing as a warning from Xi that Trump's moves on trade could undermine the most ambitious goal -- peace with North Korea -- on his foreign policy agenda.

""I think China is sending a message to Trump: You want to put trade tariffs on us and have our cooperation with North Korea? You can't have both,"" Bill Richardson, the former US energy secretary, ambassador and repeat US envoy to North Korea, told CNN.

Complex relationships

Kim's visit was his third pilgrimage to Beijing in as many months and came just days after the North Korean dictator's high-profile June 12 summit with Trump in Singapore.

Publicly, Xi has vowed to maintain a constructive role in facilitating efforts toward denuclearization and supported North Korea's commitment to that goal despite issues with the US over trade.

But tensions are rising. On Monday, Trump ordered the US trade representative to prepare new tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports. Trump was reacting angrily to Beijing's decision to match $50 billion in tariffs he placed on Chinese goods on June 15 to protest China's ""unfair trade practices.""

""Again and again the US has been provoking a trade war,"" China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday. He said China does not wish to fight a trade war, ""but is not scared of one.""

""We advise the US side to return to reason, and stop words and actions that harm itself and others,"" Geng said.

On Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert cautioned against conflating disagreements over trade with China's cooperation in talks with North Korea, noting that the US maintains complex relationships with many countries.

""We have areas where we work with China and have -- and we have strong relations, but there are also areas where we're not always in agreement with China, and we will certainly bring those to light,"" she said, highlighting the ""good work that President Xi and the Chinese government have done in helping to bring North Korea to the negotiating table.""

""We want to have a constructive relationship with the government of China. In order to do that, we need to repair, make some progress on some issues related to trade,"" Nauert said.

According to Mintaro Oba, a former Korea desk officer at the State Department under President Barack Obama, it is not yet clear whether trade tensions between the US and China are having an impact on negotiations with North Korea, but he warned that Xi could temper his cooperation if tensions continue to rise.

""The Chinese are still trying to preserve the space to climb down from this,"" he told CNN. ""But if the Trump administration continues to escalate the fight on trade so far that relations sour in a major way, it's possible the Chinese will feel less and less inclined to cooperate on enforcing and generating pressure on the North Korean regime.""

China has helped make the Trump administration's ""maximum pressure"" campaign against North Korea effective, US officials say, but historically Beijing has been slow to apply sanctions against Pyongyang or has looked the other way on Chinese companies doing business with Pyongyang and on North Korean smuggling.

Beijing fears a regime collapse next door that could send desperate refugees flooding across its borders and even worse, the prospect of US troops moving into North Korea as a stabilizing force, bringing them right to Chinese borders.

Looking for leverage

Xi feted Kim during his visit, underscoring the newly warm ties by sending crowds of jubilant children to greet Kim waving Chinese flags and jumping up and down.

The Chinese leader praised Kim for his handling of the US meeting last week in Singapore and conveyed his satisfaction with the results of the summit as well as Pyongyang's goal of economic development, according to Chinese state media CCTV.

As Trump continues to demand credit for his role in making ""initial steps toward a deal"" with North Korea by establishing a personal rapport with the young dictator, Kim is pulling all the levers available to strengthen his own negotiating position.

His relationship with China is one of them, according to Richardson, who said Xi holds the power to loosen sanctions that are biting the North Korean economy by looking the other way on cross-border smuggling and energy restrictions imposed by the US and United Nations.

""I believe Kim Jong Un is trying to delay denuclearization and do it at his own pace,"" he said, noting that can be accomplished only with sanctions relief from China -- a step the North Korean leader views as an apt reward for rapprochement with Trump.

While Trump has publicly claimed to have ""solved"" the North Korea issue during his made-for-television meeting with Kim, the reality of the situation remains more complex as Kim continues to seek negotiating leverage.

""Kim's logic is pretty simple: more options, more leverage,"" said Oba. ""Without engagement with the United States, Kim going to Beijing would make him look desperate and highlight North Korea's dependence on China.

""And without China clearly backing North Korea, the United States might feel more free to abandon diplomacy and ramp up pressure. Now he gets to look independent and strong while playing both sides to get the best possible situation for North Korea.""

Critics argue that Kim has only been emboldened by Trump's failure to demand specific concessions when the two met face-to-face.

Sources have told CNN that there is nothing to suggest that North Korea has begun destroying its missile launch sites, despite Trump's repeated claims to the contrary and his declaration last week that the country is no longer a nuclear threat.

Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies nuclear proliferation, told CNN that Trump's decision to suspend August's joint military drills with South Korea, without demanding North Korea take concrete steps toward disarmament, concedes strategic flexibility to both Kim and Xi.

North Korea and China have long pushed for an end to US military exercises with Japan and South Korea, suggesting that Pyongyang would stop military exercises in return, known as a ""freeze for a freeze.""

""Now that Trump seems intent on escalating the trade war with China, if Kim Jong Un decides to skirt the margins of 'freeze for freeze,' there isn't a snowflake's chance in hell that China sees that as a violation justifying putting any screws on North Korea,"" Narang said.

He referenced a recent headline to further illustrate his point.",Kim Jong Un ends visit to China with a message for the US,http://cnn.com/2018/06/20/politics/kim-xi-meeting-trump-summit/index.html
262,262,2018-01-03 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) High-intensity interval training will be the No. 1 fitness trend in the coming year, while smartphone exercise apps that prompt your activities will be out -- or so says the Worldwide Survey of Fitness Trends for 2018 .

Such training, known as HIIT, typically involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise followed by a short period of rest or recovery: intermittently sprinting for 30 seconds, for example, during a moderate-pace jog.

The US national physical activity guidelines recommend 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week with additional muscle-strengthening exercise for adults and 60 minutes a day for children, noted Walter R. Thompson, author of the report and prtesident of the American College of Sports Medicine. ""So if you step it up a little bit and get your heart rate up and move from, say, walking to jogging, it decreases to 75 minutes per week.""

HIIT is a worthy way to meet your physical activity guidelines, he said. ""But there's a word of caution with that: Anytime you do high-intensity anything, there may be an increased risk of injury.""

If you doubt your ability to safely exercise in high-intensity bursts, Thompson recommends that you ""get a good physical exam"" before starting a program.

Over the past 12 years, the editors of the American College of Sports Medicine's Health & Fitness Journal have circulated an electronic survey to thousands of professionals, including personal trainers and physical therapists, to predict the biggest health and fitness trends for the coming year.

This year's survey, which included responses from 4,133 fitness professionals around the globe, placed ""group training"" -- classes involving more than five participants -- in the No. 2 slot. Meanwhile, ""wearable technology"" -- such as activity trackers and smartwatches -- came in third, and ""body weight training"" -- the use of your own body weight as a form of resistance while doing modified pushups and other exercises -- came in fourth. ""Strength training,"" or the use of barbells and weights, placed fifth.

Thompson said the survey was developed for two purposes, the first being ""to help guide the fitness industry.""

Although most of the industry is ""commercial properties,"" the survey is also helpful to community-based organizations, corporate wellness programs and medical fitness centers.

""They need some direction as to what will be the next trend in the industry so that when they use their valuable resources for something, they know it's going to work,"" Thompson said.

""We also do it from the perspective of people who use the gym, the clients,"" he said. ""It helps them identify gyms across the country that are offering the best kinds of exercise programs.""

Three new trends found a place on the top 20 list: ""licensure for fitness professionals"", ""core training"" and ""sport-specific Training."" Licensure refers to the general trend toward more regulation of fitness professionals, such as personal trainers. Core work stresses strength and conditioning of the stabilizing muscles of the abdomen, thorax and back. Sport-specific exercising is usually geared toward younger athletes and focuses on a single sport, such as tennis or boxing.

Meanwhile, ""work-site health promotion"" (which ranked 16th in last year's survey) and ""outcomes measures"" (previously 18th) fell from the top 20 list. In other words, incentive programs in employer-based health care benefits plans and comparison measurements to improve performance are no longer fashionable among the gym set.

One of the biggest surprises on the 2018 list was the ""re-emergence of group exercise programs,"" said Thompson, who remembers ""back in the day when that was all we did.""

Personal training, which was introduced around 2000, reduced the popularity of group training, he noted. However, after the recession, less expensive group training sessions re-emerged and apparently continue to thrive. ""It's got to help increase revenue and decrease expenses,"" Thompson said.

Another trend for 2018 will be older adults being welcomed back into fitness clubs.

Most gyms ""still see their greatest revenue source as the 25- to 35-year-old age bracket,"" Thompson said. But the ""really smart clubs"" are changing music and lighting during slower times when the typical gym-goer is at work, ""so that now, the 60-year-old feels comfortable going into the gym,"" he said. ""It makes total sense.""

Finally, yoga remains in the top 10, where it has been since the survey started, Thompson said. ""Yoga keeps reinventing itself.""",The top fitness trends for 2018,http://cnn.com/2018/01/03/health/exercise-trends-survey-2018/index.html
263,263,2018-06-21 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Doctors don't know what causes Alzheimer's disease or the best way to treat it, but they have new evidence to suggest that a common virus may play a role in who develops the condition.

In a study published Thursday in the journal Neuron , researchers say they've found strong evidence to suggest that two strains ofthe human herpes virus -- 6A and 7 -- may contribute to the disease that robs people of their memory and cognitive functions.

Someone in the United States develops Alzheimer's every 65 seconds , and by midcentury, it's expected to be every 33 seconds, according to the Alzheimer's Association . With costs of carerunning into the trillions of dollars by that time, scientists are working urgently to understand the disease in hopes of finding a cure or at least an effective treatment. Alzheimer's is the sole disease in the top 10 US causes of death that has no significant treatment available.

The researchers in the new study looked at data on 622 brains from people who had had signs of the disease and 322 from people who did not seem to be affected by it. The brains with Alzheimer's had levels of the herpes virus that were up to twice as high as in people who did not have the disease.

Some scientists have long believed that viruses play a role in the development of Alzheimer's. One of the most prominent theories is that Alzheimer's may start in the brain as a response to injury from a virus. Another theory is that Alzheimer's is a mix of disease process in the brain, but experts don't know for sure.

""I don't think we can answer whether herpes viruses are a primary cause of Alzheimer's disease. But what's clear is that they're perturbing networks and participating in networks that directly accelerate the brain towards the Alzheimer's topology,"" Joel Dudley, a geneticist and co-author on the study, said in a statement. Dudley is a member of the ASU-Banner Neurodegenerative Disease Research Center.

The researchers were surprised by the results of the study, he said. ""The title of the talk that I usually give is, 'I Went Looking for Drug Targets, and All I found Were These Lousy Viruses,' "" he said.

Dudley believes the new study could help scientists identify virus biomarkers in the brain that could one day help diagnose the disease and assess a person's risk. He also hopes it could be the beginning of research that would provide new targets in the brain for drugs to treat the condition.

""This is the most compelling evidence ever presented that points to a viral contribution to the cause or progression of Alzheimer's,"" said study co-author Dr. Sam Gandy , a professor of neurology and psychiatry and director of the Center for Cognitive Health at Mount Sinai in New York.

The scientists caution that people shouldn't be alarmed by their discovery. This particular set of herpes viruses is common. About 90% of adults have been exposed to the herpes virus by age 50, research shows, and not all of them will go on to develop dementia.

""While these findings do potentially open the door for new treatment options to explore in a disease where we've had hundreds of failed trials, they don't change anything that we know about the risk and susceptibility of Alzheimer's disease or our ability to treat it today,"" Gandy said.

Keith Fargo , the Alzheimer's Association's director of scientific programs and outreach, said that more research will need to be done to prove that there is a connection between herpes viruses and Alzheimer's.

""However, if viruses or other infections are confirmed to have roles in Alzheimer's, it may enable researchers to find new antiviral or immune therapies to treat or prevent the disease,"" Fargo said. ""The Alzheimer's Association welcomes new ideas in the Alzheimer's field and new avenues to pursue for potential treatments and prevention strategies.""","Herpes virus may play role in Alzheimer's, study says",http://cnn.com/2018/06/21/health/herpes-virus-alzheimers-study/index.html
264,264,2018-06-19 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Modern scientists face several pressing mysteries in their quest to understand the laws of the universe. A recent discovery could represent a very substantial step forward in solving a couple of them.

Researchers operating at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), recently announced evidence for the discovery of a new kind of particle called a sterile neutrino . If confirmed, the existence of sterile neutrinos would be a remarkable breakthrough for the scientific community.

But the excitement wouldn't stop there. If, in fact, this type of particle exists, it is a candidate for dark matter , a hypothesized form of matter that hasn't been directly observed, but would explain many astronomical puzzles (like the fact that galaxies rotate faster than can be explained by the matter we see they contain and the known laws of gravity).

Dark matter is five times more prevalent than ordinary matter and, if the recent measurement holds up, this would be a huge deal.

Even more tantalizing, if sterile neutrinos were observed, they were not observed by a dark-matter-seeking experiment. Instead, they are a proposed solution to a different problem involving a subatomic particle that seems to be constantly changing its very identity. This subatomic particle is called the neutrino.

Fermilab is America's leading particle physics laboratory and it has embarked on an ambitious plan to lead neutrino research for the next few decades. When researchers made their recent observation, they weren't looking for dark matter. Instead they were studying neutrinos.

While sterile neutrinos are still hypothetical, ordinary neutrinos are solidly accepted physics. There exist three known types of ordinary neutrinos , like the three flavors of Neapolitan ice cream. Because ordinary neutrinos interact only via the weakest of the forces that act on particles smaller than atoms, they are the ghosts of the subatomic world and can penetrate the entire Earth essentially unscathed. It is possible to stop neutrinos, but it would take more than a lightyear of solid lead to absorb half of them.

Neutrinos are made in nuclear processes (think nuclear reactors and atomic explosions) and in particle accelerators. In 1998 , it was observed that the three types of neutrinos could "" oscillate ,"" which is they would change their identity, with type 1 turning into one of the other two types and then back to 1 in an endless cycle.

With the observation of neutrino oscillation , the world's physics community turned their attention to the phenomenon. They were interested in learning such things as the speed at which the neutrinos oscillated and the rate at which a particular neutrino type turned into each of the other two. Another important parameter was the difference in the masses of the neutrino types because neutrino oscillation depends not on the specific mass of neutrinos, but rather how much they differ from one another.

Studying neutrinos became an intellectual industry. There were dozens of independent experiments telling a consistent story, each reporting similar values for the parameters being studied. Well, except for one.

The Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector , or LSND collaboration used a beam of neutrinos generated by the accelerator complex at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for their research. But what they found was that their measurement was inconsistent with the reports of other scientists. The only way they could make sense of their measurements was if there existed not three types of neutrinos participating in neutrino oscillations, but rather four or more.

Further, these extra kinds of neutrinos were not the ordinary kind. Remember that ordinary neutrinos are affected by the weakest of the subatomic forces. These new types of neutrinos did seem to oscillate, but didn't feel this weak force. Thus, they were called sterile neutrinos , to indicate their indifference to the forces the other neutrinos experienced.

These sterile neutrinos could have significant mass and are therefore a possible candidate for dark matter . After all, dark matter is an undiscovered particle that experiences gravity and none of the other known forces. The non-interacting sterile neutrino perfectly fits the bill.

Normally when only one experimental result differs from all of the others, it is considered to be a mistake of some sort. While rare, that sort of thing happens in frontier research -- blunders can occur or sometimes it's just a mathematical fluke.

In general, the neutrino science community treated the LSND experiment as one of these -- a curiosity that was likely wrong. However, scientists are a cautious bunch and it was possible that LSND found something that other researchers missed, so a follow-on experiment was proposed and conducted, called the MiniBooNE experiment, this time located at Fermilab.

Unlike all the other experiments, which produced results that contradicted the LSND anomaly, MiniBooNE's measurement agreed with LSND. If the MiniBooNE measurement is correct, then it appears that LSND might have been right all along. Further, if one combines the MiniBooNE and LSND data, the aggregate measurement satisfies the criterion for claiming a discovery

Ordinarily, an announcement like this would blast its way across the scientific world, with a trip to Stockholm for the brilliant discoverer, but caution is still warranted. While LSND and MiniBooNE announced compatible results, it turns out that some of the same researchers who were part of the LSND effort were also part of the team that published the MiniBooNE experiment results.

This means that the new measurement is not completely independent of the first one. And, of course, there are all those other measurements that disagree.

So, did LSND and MiniBooNE find something that the rest of the scientific community missed? Maybe. It's entirely possible that these researchers were the clever ones, with an insight that the rest of the neutrino research world overlooked or a capability that the others lacked.

Or possibly, the two experiments made a similar mistake, resulting in a similar misleading result. Given the stakes for how this announcement might alter our understanding of the fundamental rules of nature, it is important to be incredibly cautious.

265,265,2018-06-21 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Whether you're preparing for a day at the beach or an outdoor picnic this summer, make sure to put sun protection on your to-do list.

Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States, and UV light exposure is its most preventable risk factor. But according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2014, over a third of adults reported having a sunburn, the skin's natural response to UV damage, in the previous year.

Here's what you'll need to know to protect your skin against damage.

How to prevent sunburn

A common misconception is that the only way to protect against UV radiation is by wearing sunscreen, says Dawn Holman , a behavioral scientist at the CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control. Instead, she recommends using a ""layered approach"": combining sunscreen with staying in the shade and wearing clothing made from tightly woven fabric, sunglasses and wide-brim hats.

UV light comes in two forms: UVA rays, which tend to cause premature aging of the skin known as photoaging, and UVB rays, which typically cause skin cancers and sunburns. SPF, short for sun protection factor, is a measurement of protection against UVB rays without factoring in UVA radiation.

SPF is essentially a calculation of the additional protection sunscreen gives its wearer compared with bare skin, says Dr. Alexandra Kuritzky , a dermatologist in Vancouver and a clinical instructor in the Department of Dermatology and Skin Science at the University of British Columbia.

""It's a multiplier, and it's unique to the individual, because if one individual might be able to, say, spend 30 minutes outside before they sunburn, their SPF 30 product, for instance, is going to protect them for longer than it would an individual who burns after 10 minutes with sun exposure,"" she added.

But the US Food and Drug Administration cautions against thinking of SPF as relating to time of solar exposure. Rather, it relates to the amount of sun exposure the wearer gets.

SPF recommendations

Another way to think about SPF is as a percentage of UVB rays blocked. An SPF of 15 blocks about 93% of UVB radiation, while an SPF of 30 blocks around 97%. This means the relative benefit of using a higher SPF decreases as the number increases.

Still, the FDA and the CDC recommend choosing a sunscreen with at least an SPF of 15, while the American Academy of Dermatology suggests at least an SPF of 30.

Holman thinks of the FDA and CDC's recommendation as a bare minimum. ""This is a situation where you want to know your skin,"" she said, adding that a fair-skinned individual might want to use a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or 50.

Of course, sunscreen lives up to its SPF only when it is applied correctly, and most people don't apply enough of it. One ounce of sunscreen, enough to fill a shot glass, is considered the amount needed to cover exposed areas of the body, according to the American Academy of Dermatology . It recommends applying sunscreen to dry skin 15 minutes before going outside.

For spray-on sunscreen, an ounce can be hard to estimate, so Kuritzky says to apply it ""as if you're spray-painting,"" making sure to rub it in with your hands afterward and taking care to avoid inhaling the product.

Best sunscreens for your summer

When selecting a sunscreen, it's important to know what type of sun protection the product will give you. ""Broad-spectrum"" means the product can protect against both UVA and UVB radiation.

You'll also want to know about when you need to reapply, especially if you're planning on swimming or sweating. ""Water-resistant"" means the sunscreen will offer protection for 40 minutes, while ""very water-resistant"" means twice as long, or 80 minutes. As a general rule, though, the American Academy of Dermatology recommends reapplying sunscreen approximately every two hours . As of 2011, the FDA disallowed manufacturers from labeling sunscreens as ""waterproof"" because all sunscreens eventually wash off.

Sunscreens may also advertise ""physical"" or ""chemical"" protection, which refers to whether they put a physical barrier -- such as with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide -- between your skin and the sun, or a chemical one -- with oxybenzone or octinoxate, for example. While earlier sunscreens provided purely physical protection (think the white cream that lifeguards put on their noses), most modern ones combine physical and chemical protection for aesthetic purposes, Kuritzky said.

The active ingredients of sunscreens are regulated by the FDA, so FDA-approved sunscreens are safe for adults and children over 6 months. However, Mayo Clinic dermatologist Dr. Dawn Davis previously told CNN that people with sensitive skin or allergies might want to look for physical sunscreens containing zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, as they are usually hypoallergenic.

In addition, the FDA recommends that sunscreen not be worn by infants younger than 6 months, suggesting instead that they be kept in the shade and avoid sun exposure from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., when UV rays are at their strongest.

How to treat a sunburn





To But what to do if you didn't apply sunscreen at the right time, or in the right amount and now you can home with a sunburn?To treat a sunburn , Dr. Joshua Zeichner, director of cosmetic and clinical research in the department of dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, previously said you should take an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen or aspirin.

Then, rinse off with cool water and use a moisturizer over the next few days to replenish dehydrated skin. Make sure to stay hydrated by drinking water and eating hydrating foods , too.

Debunking sunscreen myths

Sunscreen myth No. 1: Sun protection is important only sometimes.

People need to use sunscreen year-round, rain or shine: Skin protection can be vital even indoors, Kuritzky said. Window glass blocks UVB radiation, but UVA rays can still penetrate, which over time causes the skin to thicken and wrinkle

And it is not just one kind of person who should be prioritizing sun protection, Holman said.

""We see across the board, regardless of someone's race or ethnicity, the need for sun protection,"" she added.

However, some age groups burn more often than others. Over half of US high school students reported a sunburn in 2014, compared with a third of adults, according to the CDC . Sunscreen use may play a role in that statistic: The same study found that only 13% of girls and 7% of boys routinely used a sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher when they were outside on a sunny day.

Sunscreen myth No. 2: I can get a healthy tan.

According to Holman, there is no such thing as a healthy tan.

""We know that a tan is a sign that your skin has been damaged; it's actually your skin's way of showing that it's been damaged and alerting you that, hey, I've got too much sun exposure,"" she said.

Sunscreen myth No. 3: It's too late to use sun protection now.

Blistering sunburns in adolescence and early adulthood can increase skin cancer risk substantially, but don't let memories of terrible sunburns discourage you from making an effort to protect your skin.

(CNN) I was two years old when my mother left me in India with my grandparents to come to the United States. She was fleeing an abusive marriage, and needed to find a job and a safe place for us to land. I didn't understand.

Padma Lakshmi

Every day, I'd sit on a step outside our house waiting for my mom to come back from work in America. The anguish of separation may have even contributed to a skin condition I developed around that time -- terrible blisters all over my body in the summer heat, so bad my head had to be shaved.

Today, I am far removed from that lost little girl who desperately missed her mother. But as I watch the Trump administration forcibly separating children from parents as they make their way to the United States looking for refuge, my heart breaks.

According to government figures, more than 700 children were separated from their parents from October 2017 through April 2018, including more than 100 children under the age of 4. Many of them came from violent countries in Central America to seek asylum in the United States and presented themselves to immigration officials without breaking any rules.

That was before Donald Trump's administration officially instituted a new ""zero tolerance"" policy to criminally prosecute migrants who enter the United States without authorization, even those seeking asylum -- and remove their children. It's a policy that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly has called a ""tough deterrent,"" remarking nonchalantly that ""the children will be taken care of -- put into foster care or whatever.""

268,268,2018-06-20 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Although he's older than the Giza pyramids and Stonehenge, the 5,300-year-old mummy of Otzi the Tyrolean Iceman continues to teach us things.

The latest study of the weapons he was found with, published in the journal PLOS ONE on Wednesday, reveals that Otzi was right-handed and had recently resharpened and reshaped some of his tools before his death. They were able to determine this by using high-powered microscopes to analyze the traces of wear on his tools.

The upper half of the Iceman's body was accidentally discovered by a vacationing German couple hiking in the North Italian Alps in 1991. Otzi was found with a dagger, borer, flake, antler retoucher and arrowheads. But some of the stone was collected from different areas in Italy's Trentino region, which would have been about 43.5 miles from where he was thought to live.

""Through analyzing the Iceman's toolkit from different viewpoints and reconstructing the entire life cycle of each instrument, we were able to gain insights into Otzi's cultural background, his individual history and his last hectic days,"" Ursula Wierer, study author and archaeologist, wrote in an email.

""The Iceman travelled with a compact lithic toolkit formed by few worn out, repeatedly resharpened tools, mostly used for cutting plants. Ötzi was a righthander and had a quite good skill in pressure flaking by using his own functional retoucher.""

And when compared with artifacts recovered from the Copper Age, when the Iceman lived, it appears that his tools were stylistically influenced by other Alpine cultures. Clearly, the 46-year-old Iceman, who lived in the South Tyrol region of Northern Italy between 3100 and 3370 BC, survived by staying on the move.

That is, until he was violently killed.

These new findings add to the wealth of knowledge we've gained about this mysterious figure. Here's what else we know about the Iceman and how he was killed.

Cold case

Otzi became a glacier mummy through a unique set of circumstances. He was crossing the Tisenjoch pass in the Val Senales valley of South Tyrol when he was shot in the back with an arrow by a Southern Alpine archer and became naturally preserved in the ice. Otzi, his clothing and his tools were remarkably well-preserved.

The arrowhead is still embedded in his left shoulder and wasn't found until 2001. He would have bled out and died shortly after because it pierced a vital artery. There is also a wound on the back of his head, but that may have occurred when he fell after being struck by the arrow.

A cut on his right hand, indicating hand-to-hand combat, never had a chance to heal before he died. This means that conflict happened before he was shot, perhaps hours or days before, and may have led to the second conflict that killed him.

The injury to his right hand would have made it difficult for Otzi to prepare his weapons in case of another attack. This is most likely why the bow and arrows found with him were unfinished: to replace ones that were lost or damaged in the previous conflict.

But the motive for his killing is unclear, because he was found with a very valuable copper ax. It is the only one of its kind ever discovered and could have functioned as a weapon and tool, as well as a status symbol. During the Copper Age, copper axes were owned by men of rank and buried with them. Copper was the first metal used to make weapons and tools.

During the Copper Age, metal was extracted and smelted, creating new trades and professions. This increased long-distance trade, boosted exchanges among cultures and led to the rise of new social groups.

Since 1998, Otzi and his artifacts have been on display at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, Italy. He was nicknamed Otzi because he was found in the Otztal Alps of South Tyrol.

His clothing, made from leather, hide, braided grass and animal sinews, provides a unique window into the past because other clothing from that time has never been recovered. His hide coat, leggings, loincloth, belt, fur shoes and bearskin cap would have kept him warm in the cold, wet climate.

He also carried a type of wooden backpack, containers made of birch bark rather than breakable pottery, the ax, an unfinished longbow, a quiver of arrows in progress, a flint dagger, a retoucher to sharpen blades, birch fungus to start fires or use as a therapeutic, and a stone disc to attach things to his belt.

One of the most-studied mummies

Otzi was briefly ""thawed out"" in 2010 so researchers could take tissue samples, and remarkably, he was so well-preserved that red blood cells were recovered. His nuclear genome was isolated in 2011. This revealed not only his blood type but his ancestry, appearance, medical conditions and predispositions to disease.

A reconstruction of Otzi, based on forensics and 3D modeling, showcases what he may have looked like in life.

He stood at 5 feet 2 inches tall and had a slightly muscular build of 110 pounds, a narrow and pointed face, tanned skin, brown eyes, long dark hair and a shaggy beard. His blood type was O-positive, and he was lactose-intolerant.

Otzi had a high risk of cardiovascular disease and traces of Borrelia, tick-borne bacteria that cause Lyme disease, in his genome. Bacteria in his stomach could have led to stomach ulcers. He had intestinal whipworms.

His age was considered old at the time, and he probably had arthritis. There are tattoos all over his body, specifically in places that might be considered therapeutic for someone with arthritis -- especially because they couldn't be seen if he was clothed.

On his father's side, Otzi had common ancestors with those who lived in Sardinia and Corsica and migrated to Europe from the east. His mother's side could be traced to a population from the central Alps that doesn't exist anymore.

His last meal, most likely an hour before his death, included grain and ibex and deer meat.

But many questions remain. What was his occupation? Why was he nomadic during a time of settlements? Why was he killed? The ongoing investigation into Otzi may uncover those answers in the future.","Weapons reveal how this 5,300-year-old ice mummy lived -- and died",http://cnn.com/2018/06/20/health/otzi-tyrolean-iceman-mummy-new-study/index.html
269,269,2018-04-24 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Gallup released new polling this week with an eye-popping headline: Donald Trump's re-election numbers are very similar to those of Barack Obama in 2010 and Bill Clinton in 1994.

Wait, WHAT? The narrative of Trump's first 15 months in office has been that he is at historic polling lows. Then this.

What gives? In an attempt to suss that out, my friend -- and resident CNN big brain -- Harry Enten and I exchanged a bunch of emails trying to figure out the Gallup result and what, exactly, it tells us about Trump, Republicans' chances in 2018 and Trump's own fortune heading into his 2020 reelection race.

I've reproduced that email conversation below.

: I was struck by this new Gallup poll -- or at least the headline: "" Trump's Re-Elect Figures Similar to Those of Obama, Clinton .""

Trump is at the same place as Obama and Clinton! That's remarkable, given that he has had the worst 15-month polling start of any president in the modern era.

Then I read the fine print. Yes, 37% say that Trump deserves re-election which is the exact same number who said that about Bill Clinton in 1994 and Barack Obama in 2010.

BUT, the numbers for Obama and Clinton are from October 2010 and 1994, respectively. That's after a full year of Republicans spending millions of dollars to campaign against them. We are only in April for Trump -- and the fall campaign is at its earliest stages. Virtually no ads attacking him have even run.

So, apples and oranges, right? Or wrong? And what else did you see in the poll?

Enten: Thanks for the email. I think you're on the right track with thinking this poll result isn't all it's cracked up to be.

Gallup itself released numbers closer to this point (late April of the midterm year) for both Obama and Clinton. Obama was at 46% in late March and 48% in late May of 2010. Far above Trump. Clinton was at 46% in late March and 40% in late April of 1994.

So, I don't know why Gallup did what it did. Of course, one could argue that because Trump's approval rating has been so steady that it will be in a similar position later this year, but I don't like to make assumptions like that. Who knows what all the ads Democrats will run this summer and fall will do to his ratings?

Does that make sense? And I also think there are larger problems with this question, if you're interested in hearing about them?

Cillizza: OK. We agree on that one: The Gallup poll is making an apples-to-oranges comparison.

And, yes, tell me what else you don't love in the poll.

One thing I don't want to lose sight of amid all of this: In 1994 and 2010, the president's party took an absolute beating at the polls -- losing control of the House in both elections. So, even if Trump winds up at 37% in October -- like Clinton and Obama -- that's not great news for Republicans.

Enten: Re: your last point, I think you're 100% correct. The reelect figure is really a stand-in for presidential approval. In the : Re: your last point, I think you're 100% correct. The reelect figure is really a stand-in for presidential approval. In the latest Gallup poll , Trump's at a 38% approval rating. Based upon history, that, on average, points to a net seat loss in the high 30s. Democrats only need a net gain of 23 for control.

So perhaps biggest problem I have with this question is it doesn't make it a choice between a Democrat and a Republican. There's a good chunk of voters who belong to the same party as the President who are thinking to themselves that they want a different person representing their party, but will ultimately vote for their party's nominee.

If you're truly interested in gauging the presidential matchup at this point, I think it's better to ask a question which forces the respondent think about a Democrat and a Republican. At the very least, it gets us beyond simply the incumbent. As it stands, this question is really just another way of asking about approval and disapproval. So what's the point?

When we ask about a Democrat vs. a Republican, it's when we see how unique Trump's standing in the polls really is...

Thoughts?

Cillizza: If by ""unique,"" you mean ""historically bad,"" then I am with you ;)

I think the country was significantly polarized before the 2016 election. But that election coupled with the fact that Trump won and immediately began governing in ways to please his base (and not a lot of other people) took that polarization to new heights.

The impact of that rush to your partisan extreme on polling is that almost EVERY question you can ask essentially becomes a proxy for this one: ""Do you like President Trump or not?"" Which makes nuance in polling -- and how it informs opinions about Trump -- very hard to divine.

Enten: I think there's something to that. If you're a Republican, you like Trump. As I've written about, : I think there's something to that. If you're a Republican, you like Trump. As I've written about, the Republican Party is Trump's now . Heck, take a look at where Trump's approval rating is with Republicans. It's in the mid 80s (very close to the re-elect question). It basically makes it impossible for there to be a primary challenger who has any shot of taking Trump down.

But to your larger point, I think in order to fully grasp the historicity of Trump's bad ratings, we need to look at how he's doing against potential Democratic nominees. Then we need to compare that to how other presidential incumbents were doing at this point.

That is, we need to make an apples-to-apples comparison that takes into account the polarized era in which we live.

In a CNN poll conducted earlier this year, Democrat Joe Biden and Democrat Bernie Sanders both led Trump by double digits among registered voters. I cannot begin to explain how bad of a position that is.

There were six different times since the 1948 election with polls at this point in the cycle in which the eventual matchup was surveyed.

1948: President Harry Truman was tied with Republican challenger Thomas Dewey

1956: President Dwight Eisenhower held a 8-point advantage over Democrat Adlai Stevenson

1980: President Jimmy Carter held a 7-point lead over Republican Ronald Reagan

1984: President Ronald Reagan was tied with Democrat Walter Mondale

1996: President Bill Clinton was ahead of Republican Bob Dole by 9 points

2012: President Barack Obama was up 8 points over Republican Mitt Romney

Note that in none of these polls was the incumbent in anywhere near as bad shape as Trump is right now. I'll note there were other years where the eventual matchup wasn't polled at this time, but in all of those the incumbent was either tied or well ahead of the leading challenger.

Trump is in historically bad shape. He could recover and do better than expected, but at least right now it's not looking great.

Cillizza: RIGHT.

This is the broader point I keep reminding people about. Sure, Trump's approval numbers have improved marginally over the past six weeks or so. But, he is STILL in a position that, if history is any guide, suggests his party is in very bad shape in the 2018 midterms and Trump himself faces an uphill fight to win a second term in 2020.

The retort to that point is something like: ""2020 is a long time from now."" And it is! 924 days to be exact!

But Trump's approval numbers just seem to have a very hard floor and a very hard ceiling -- almost certainly because of how polarized we are as a country and how much the policies Trump has pursued have pushed that polarization.

So while, sure, anything can happen, the likelihood of a double-digit (or even high single-digit) improvement or decline in Trump's approval ratings seems very, very low to me.

Right? Wrong? Tie a bow on all of this for me.

Enten: I think these are all valid points. I think as I've pointed out before Trump is scoring pretty well on the economy, and he's still stuck in the high 30s or low 40s. That's quite unusual.

There just hasn't been a ton of movement in Trump's numbers. I mean he couldn't even hit 50% approval in the usual post-inauguration bump.

How in the world is his approval rating going to go higher than the low 40s? Maybe, he gets a bump if special counsel Robert Mueller says ""Trump is good."" Maybe he gets a bump if we start seeing an even better economy.

I think the better question that I'm asking in a piece that hopefully will see the light of day is whether you believe the normal rules of politics apply to Trump. You're going to see a lot of fancy models out there about Trump and low approval ratings...

But let's be clear, presidents who have approval ratings of 40% usually don't get reelected. That's especially the case when their favorability rating (a slightly different measure) is also in the same area.

Unless the normal rules don't apply to Trump, the only way he wins in 2020 if his approval rating is 40% is for the Democrats to nominate an equally unpopular candidate.",The problem with that Gallup poll that shows Trump's re-election numbers equal to Obama's,http://cnn.com/2018/04/24/politics/trumps-approval-rating/index.html
270,270,2018-06-21 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Tigaras Port, North Sumatra, Indonesia (CNN) The search effort for more than 190 people presumed drowned after a tourist ferry sank on a crater lake in Indonesia earlier this week has been extended a further four days, amid growing anger over the government's failure to prevent the tragedy.

The boat, which was believed to be more than three times its passenger capacity, sank on Monday after encountering high-waves while crossing Lake Toba, on the Indonesian province of North Sumatra. Only 18 survivors have been found from an estimated 213 on board, all within several hours of the accident.

Despite a coordinated effort by several Indonesian government agencies, efforts to locate the sunken vessel have so far been hampered by bad weather and poor visibility. Authorities have said the current search will continue until Sunday, seven days after the accident.

On Wednesday evening, a fight broke out when a small group of distraught relatives attempted to take control of a government rescue boat on the shores of Lake Toba, in an effort to speed up the search.

The group, who did not succeed, accused the authorities of wasting time and not searching properly.

One relative who would only give her name as Vera said, ""We don't want to speak out of turn but why haven't they found more people by now? We think it's poor time management at this point and we need to get our families back.""

Responding to the disaster Wednesday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo called on emergency services to find the missing victims ""as soon as possible.""

""This incident is a lesson for all of us to always be careful, for all boat owners, obey the regulations, prioritize passengers safety and follow instructions from the meteorological agency for any forecast or potential bad weather,"" said Widodo in a statement.

The exact cause of the accident is unknown, with authorities pointing to both bad weather and overloading as potential factors.

However, Chief of Police for Simalungun Regency, Liberty Pandjaitan, told CNN Tuesday that investigators believe ""human error"" was also involved.

""The boat captain was found alive and has been taken into custody,"" said Pandjaitan, who said police would not release details of the case publicly for fears of reprisals against his family.

The Indonesian emergency services believe most of the bodies of the victims are still trapped inside the two-tier ferry at the bottom of the lake, which is up to 505 meters (1,657 feet) deep in places.

The top deck of the two tier wooden boat had a metal cage surrounding the seating area to stop thieves entering at night, which would also have made it impossible for passengers to escape, even if they had broken the windows.

Helicopters which assisted in the initial search for survivors were grounded Wednesday as the operation shifted focus.

""We now consider this a recovery effort rather than a search and rescue due to the amount of time that has elapsed since the sinking,"" Indonesian National Board for Disaster official, Wanda Ketaren, told CNN.

A woman cries as she finds out her family are listed as missing, at the Lake Toba ferry port in the province of North Sumatra on June 19, 2018, after a boat capsized the day before.

Despite the promise to extend the search until Sunday, little progress has been made in locating the boat, which authorities believe is at the bottom of the lake.

Efforts have so far focused on an oil slick, believed to be site of the sinking, with a team of divers dispatched to the area.

Brigadier General Bambang Suryo Aji who is helping to coordinate the operation said, ""If we find the boat we will then take steps to decide how best to bring it to the surface. We do not have that information yet.""

Rescue team members prepare to search for missing passengers at the Lake Toba ferry port in the province of North Sumatra on June 20, 2018.

To date, no request has been made for special equipment from abroad.

""We are not asking for more personnel to come to the scene. We already have 350 people working here which we think is enough,"" said Brig. Gen. Aji.

Lake Toba is a popular sightseeing destination in North Sumatra, thanks to its status as the world's largest crater lake which spans some 1,130 square kilometers (440 square miles).

The Indonesian government recently declared the area one of the ""10 New Balis,"" a new tourism growth strategy -- and the brainchild of Indonesian president, Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo -- designed to lure foreign visitors to other parts of the country.

The strategy also included the opening of Silangit International Airport, an hour's drive from Lake Toba, in October 2017.

A search and rescue operation is underway but has been hampered by bad weather.

Ferries such as the one that sank Monday remain a popular and necessary mode of transport for tourists visiting the lake.

Authorities have so far rejected claims that travel in the region is unsafe, or that the accident would prove damaging to the region's fledgling tourist industry.

""This was an isolated incident due to bad weather and overcrowding. We are taking steps to ensure it will never happen again,"" said Brig. Gen. Aji.

The boat had a limited number of life-jackets and was overloaded with both passengers and cargo.

""We need to balance the logistics of bringing the boat to the surface with the wishes of the families, but I have heard no reports that they are not satisfied with our response to the incident. The teams are doing their best,"" said Brig. Gen. Aji.","Indonesian ferry: Anger grows, search extended for 192 missing people",http://cnn.com/2018/06/21/asia/indonesian-ferry-accident-intl/index.html

This consolidation is not the same as a class-action

(CNN) An Ohio judge has ordered that a committee oversee the progress of over 50 lawsuits against University Hospitals in Cleveland, where more than 4,000 embryos and eggs belonging to an estimated 950 families become unviable after a cryopreservation system malfunctioned.

Cuyahoga County Judge Stuart Friedman's order, which was filed June 21, provides structure to cases that had been consolidated this year. The order creates an executive committee and five subcommittees made up of plaintiffs' lawyers from 15 firms.

This is intended to streamline the legal process and keep the lawyers from doing duplicative work.

The case management order, which came from a joint motion filed by both plaintiffs and defendants, will assist all parties and the court in the management of the litigation, according to a University Hospitals statement.

Eggs and embryos had been stored in a liquid nitrogen tank at University Hospitals in Cleveland, which was equipped with a remote alarm system that should have alerted an employee to any temperature change. But the hospital says the alarm was off, so an alert was never issued when an apparent malfunction caused temperatures in the tank to rise. Because it was Saturday night when the lab wasn't staffed, no one noticed the continuing rise in temperature. As a result, the eggs and embryos thawed.

272,272,2018-06-20 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Reynosa, Mexico (CNN) In a sparsely furnished migrant shelter a few miles south of the border with McAllen, Texas, little Joan Flores ran around pretending to wear a bulletproof vest.

The fantasy game started in his native El Salvador, after the 7-year-old boy had seen members of a gang known as the ""Exterminations"" fatally shoot a man in the eye outside his family's home, according to his mother.

""My country is no place for children -- no place for my son,"" Patricia Flores, 27, said Wednesday. ""I don't want him to grow up like that.""

Here at the Senda de Vida (Path of Life) shelter, many of the 50 or so migrants contemplating their next moves seemed undeterred by a Trump administration zero tolerance policy that resulted in thousands of family separations.

""It's been too long a journey to give up now,"" said Flores, who has been at the shelter two weeks after having been turned away twice at the border bridge by US immigration authorities.

""We all have a dream and, God willing, we will make it happen.""

Migrants await their next move at Senda de Vida shelter.

The migrants are well aware of the widely condemned policy that has resulted in the separations of least 2,000 children from their families.

Some have decided to return home after their often perilous journeys north, to places like El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.

Still, many appear unfazed by the administration decision to refer all people caught crossing the border illegally for prosecution, including those with children. The policy has resulted in families being separated when the adults are detained to face criminal charges, without clear procedures for reuniting them with their children afterward.

""I cannot go back home,"" said Flores, sitting on a bunk bed and growing emotional, arms crossed over her chest. ""There is no future for our children there.""

'I only have scars to show them'

The Senda de Vida shelter in Reynosa, Mexico, housed about 50 migrants on Wednesday.

Even as Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order ending family separations by allowing them to be detained together, the migrants at the Reynosa shelter, a short walk from the Rio Grande, waited amid confusion and uncertainty.

They sat together for breakfast. They took turns washing the plastic cups and plates they used. A young boy wearing a red shirt, shorts and sandals pushed an old man in a wheelchair to the sink. One child played with a cell phone. A little girl in a Hello Kitty t-shirt ran around smiling. A groups of boys doodled on sheets of paper.

For many migrants, like 26-year-old Christian Ortiz, returning home -- in his case Honduras -- isn't an option.

Ortiz said he fled his native land months ago, driven away by an ultimatum from a ruthless street gang.

A cross at the Rio Grande in Reynosa, Mexico, is a memorial to migrants who died crossing the border.

""Either I belong to them or they kill my family,"" he said in a shelter room where mattresses are pancaked on top of each other during the day.

As a driving rain falls outside, Ortiz raised his shirt to show the scars on his back from the lashings of gang members trying to recruit him. He decided to leave his young children behind and make his way to the US border. He said he saw two men killed as they rode a train north through Mexico. He hopes to eventually connect with family in Houston.

Aside from the scars, Ortiz said he has little evidence of the perils he faces back home to make a case for asylum.

""I have no proof, no documentation,"" he said. ""I only have scars to show them.""

Christian Ortiz, a migrant from Honduras, shows scars he said are from lashings by gang members.

'The need is greater than the fear'

His only hope now, he said, is to make it across the border. His family has been calling him for money, he said.

""I hope Donald Trump has a change of heart,"" he said. ""I hope he can show some compassion ... I don't know if he has a heart of stone with all the things he has said but we are all human with hearts of flesh. Maybe if he hears our stories he will change.""

Dolores Contreras Alarcon, 40, says she will try to cross the border again

Dolores Contreras Alarcon, 40, said she was separated from her three sons after being detained by US immigration authorities in Texas late last month. She and her sons were deported after about four days but her husband remains in US custody.

A native of the Mexican port city of Veracruz, Contreras said she told an agent that she had medicine one of her sons needed for epilepsy.

""We don't care,"" she said the agent told her, ordering her to throw the pills away. ""You shouldn't have come to this country.""

On her first border crossing, Contreras said, she took a boat across the Rio Grande and trekked through mountainous terrain in the predawn hours before encountering the border patrol. She vowed to try it again.

""Yes, I'm afraid but the need is greater than the fear,"" she said. ""We know the risks.""",These migrants are undeterred: 'It's been too long a journey to give up now',http://cnn.com/2018/06/20/americas/migrants-shelter-mexico-border/index.html

Segev had been recruited in 2012 by Iran's embassy in Nigeria, the ISA said. The disgraced former doctor had moved to Nigeria after serving time in prison in Israel for a 2006 drug smuggling conviction. Segev had been sentenced for attempting to bring 25,000 Ecstasy pills into Israel from the Netherlands.

He was returned to Israel last month at the request of Israeli police and was detained for investigation.

According to the ISA, Segev met twice with Iranian operatives, knowing they were from Iranian intelligence. The Agency said Segev was given a communications system to encrypt messages with his handlers.

The former Energy Minister allegedly revealed information connected to Israel's energy market and security sites, including intelligence on buildings, and officials in political and security organizations, the ISA said.

274,274,2018-06-18 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Berlin (CNN) German Chancellor Angela Merkel was given two weeks Monday to agree a new migration policy with European leaders or face a renewed rebellion from her own government that is threatening to bring her 13-year rule to an end.

The architect of the division is her interior minister, Horst Seehofer of the Christian Social Union (CSU) -- the Bavarian sister party to Merkel's own Christian Democratic Union (CDU).

Seehofer last week defied Merkel to announce a tough new immigration policy that would see some asylum seekers turned away at the borders of Germany. He had suggested he could implement the proposals unilaterally, in defiance of both European regulations and the chancellor.

But Merkel announced Monday that the two parties have agreed that she will seek to reach bilateral agreements in the next two weeks with other European Union leaders to allow Germany to turn back asylum seekers at the border, and nullify any need for unilateral action.

On July 1, after the completion of a two-day EU summit, Merkel will meet with the CDU executive to discuss next steps, the chancellor said Monday.

In a statement released Monday, the CSU said that an immediate ban on entry will be implemented for people who have previously been refused residence in Germany and that further rejections would begin in two weeks if Merkel was unable to broker the desired agreements.

""The rejections will take effect from the first week of July at the latest if no effective results are achieved at the upcoming EU summit,"" the statement said.

Merkel insisted Monday that the CSU and CDU have the same goal -- to better control immigration -- but that it was an issue that can only be resolved on the European level. She also acknowledged the difficulty of the task ahead: ""I am under pressure now, and those who know Europe know that this is not easy.""

Seehofer's ""migration master plan,"" which Merkel last week refused to endorse, would see asylum seekers arriving at Germany's borders turned away if they have no identification papers, have already had an asylum claim rejected in Germany, or are already registered in another country in the EU -- proposals that rights group say contravene European and international agreements.

Merkel said Monday that she agreed with 62 of the 63 proposals in the plan, which has not yet been published in full.

Seehofer, whose party is more socially conservative than Merkel's, has long been a critic of the chancellor's immigration policies, particularly her decision to open Germany's borders at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015.

But after the pair agreed last October to try to limit Germany's refugee intake to 200,000 a year -- a policy Seehofer had long called for and Merkel had previously ruled out -- tensions seemed to fade.

Critics see Seehofer's maneuvering as an attempt to burnish his party's right-wing credentials ahead of Bavarian state elections in October. The CSU lost thousands of voters to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in federal elections last year, and is fearful of further losses.

Seehofer is proposing a controversial ""migration master plan.""

End of the road for Merkel?

Merkel, who has led Europe's largest economy since 2005, was widely seen as unassailable in the run-up to elections last September.

Her position as chancellor is now in question, but it remains unclear precisely how the situation will develop.

If the split over migration deepens and Merkel fires Seehofer, that could lead to a split in the CDU/CSU union which may in turn trigger a vote of no confidence and a possible end to Merkel's tenure.

Alternatively, if the CSU splits from the CDU and becomes an opposition party, the governing coalition would be left with 353 seats, one short of a majority, potentially triggering the collapse of the government.

How did we get here?

Merkel's comments on Monday followed a week of rising tensions within the CDU/CSU alliance after the interior minister first floated his ""master plan.""

His proposals were a surprise to many -- a few months ago, Seehofer appeared to rule out rejecting people at the border, calling at the time for detention centers to house asylum seekers while their claims were processed.

Speaking Thursday, Merkel described the plan as ""a good and important project,"" but insisted that migration was an EU-wide challenge and that Germany ""should not act unilaterally"" or ""at the expense of third parties.""

She promised to pursue bilateral agreements on the distribution of asylum seekers as she meets with European leaders ahead of the EU summit at the end of the month.

Merkel was due to meet with Italy's newly-minted Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Monday, and the following day with French President Emmanuel Macron.

Her approach has the backing of most CDU and SPD lawmakers. Pictures appeared on Twitter Sunday of the EU flag flying above the SPD headquarters in Berlin, rather than the national ensign.

On Monday the foreign affairs minister, SPD lawmaker Heiko Maas, tweeted a strong defense of Merkel and a Europe-wide response to migration : ""The EU stands for a promise that has made Europe a place of longing worldwide. If we want to defend our liberal democracy, we need more Europe, not less.""

But the chancellor's pledge has been met with skepticism by some CSU politicians, who question the possibility of reaching an EU-wide agreement after several years of failed attempts.

The prospects of Merkel reaching a deal on migration with Conte on Monday would appear slim. Italy's new populist government -- made up of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the anti-immigrant League party -- is taking a hard line on migration and has already begun turning away boats of migrants from its ports.

According to the Institute for Human Rights in Berlin , Seehofer's proposals violate Germany's European and human-rights obligations. The Geneva Refugee Convention, to which Germany is a signatory, guarantees every person seeking protection against human-rights violations the right to an asylum procedure, regardless of whether they have identification papers or not.

Furthermore, although asylum seekers registered in another EU country do not have the right to claim asylum in Germany under German law, that legislation is superseded by EU rules, which stipulate that every EU country must check which state is responsible for an asylum seeker, rather than sending him or her back across the border.",Angela Merkel given ultimatum over migration policy,http://cnn.com/2018/06/18/europe/merkel-seehofer-migration-intl/index.html

(CNN) Prom dresses are designed to get reactions, and the history of social media is littered with viral prom outfits -- dresses made out of unusual materials , dresses that send statements and dresses that are, well, regrettable, to say the least.

But the viral reaction 18-year-old Keziah Daum has sparked with her prom dress is shocking, in no small part because of its disproportionate intensity. Her decision to wear a Chinese outfit called (depending on your dialect) a qipao or a cheongsam to prom in Utah, despite having no Chinese ancestry -- and then tweeting pictures of her posing with friends at prom - - has launched a social media debate around cultural appropriation that's generated hundreds of thousands of posts and comments, many of them outraged, and some of them outrageous.

As she said to Buzzfeed, ""I never imagined a simple rite of passage such as a prom would cause a discussion reaching many parts of the world,"" Daum said. ""Perhaps it is an important discussion we need to have.""

She's right on that point: Cultural appropriation is a real and serious concern that's deeply intertwined with issues like colonialism, labor theft, racial privilege and ethnic stereotyping. Dismissal of the phenomenon is often simply a knee-jerk reaction by those seeking to assail what they see as ""political correctness.""

But as always with these discussions, it pays to consider context before opening fire.

Is it inherently appropriative for a non-Chinese person to wear Chinese-style apparel? The answer is: It depends.

Is the person wearing it as part of an attempt at racial aping, mockery or stereotyping ( see: every Halloween ever )? Is the clothing itself an inappropriate variation of attire that's worn for culturally essentialist or religious purposes (example: conical peasant hats or anything with the Buddha stamped on i t)? Is the outfit being worn to an event whose theme uses Asian aesthetics in the service of white establishment privilege (e.g. , so many museum galas)?

And what, for that matter, are the actual origins of the garment in question?

Because the qipao, especially in its contemporary form, is far from a ""traditional"" Chinese outfit. In fact, it historically wasn't ""female"" clothing at all — or even ""Chinese.""

The outfit that became the qipao, the sijigiyan, was the traditional ethnic clothing of the Manchu, who took over China in 1644 and established their own Qing Dynasty as its rulers. In the process, they mandated that all adult Chinese men in service of the throne wear Manchu garb -- turning the loose-fitting straight-line sijigiyan, known in Mandarin Chinese as the changpao, into both a symbol of elite status and a stamp of absolute Manchu domination.

Eventually, the practice of wearing changpao became common even among non-Manchurian Chinese men who weren't part of the government. But non-Manchurian Chinese women continued to wear typical Chinese outfits -- usually blouses and long skirts under loose coats or jackets -- until the Qing Dynasty fell in 1911.

By the 1930s, in colonial Shanghai and Hong Kong, the traditional Manchu male outfit had become feminized and stylized: The long gown was cut short and shaped to fit women's curves, elaborately printed or embroidered and turned into the dress commonly referred to as the qipao. Today, Chinese women who aren't restaurant staff or flight attendants do not wear the modern version of the qipao -- skin-tight, with a revealing leg slit and a hemline above the knee -- for anything other than weddings and gala events.

Which brings us back to Keziah Daum's decision to wear a qipao to her prom. She clearly didn't consider the full implications of her decision to not just wear the dress, but to post pictures of herself doing so on social media without explanation. And her comments to the press make it apparent that she hasn't fully reflected on the way that wearing outfits or hairstyles associated with other cultures is itself an expression of privilege.

But in all fairness, her critics may actually be less knowledgeable about the dress than she is -- after all, Daum has referenced the qipao's association with female empowerment as one of the reasons she chose to wear it.

More importantly, those who have chosen to conduct a social-media pile-on of Daum rather than engage her in civil conversation forget that she's a teenager -- one whose interest in other cultures could easily be turned into respect, mutual exchange and positive engagement.

(Though the cultural context of Asians who live in a majority-Asian societies, versus Asian Americans who live as minorities in the US, is quite different, it's worth noting that Chinese in China have largely stepped up to defend Daum's wearing of the dress as a valid homage and celebration.)

Yes, cultural appropriation is something we need to discuss. But any ""discussion"" that involves thousands of strangers attacking a teen from the safety of distance and anonymity looks a lot like cyberbullying. What's more, the incessant flame wars around Daum have prompted those on the extreme right to use her as a symbol to advance their agenda of cultural erasure.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) President Trump's Immigration Executive Order purports to bring a humane solution to the inhumane practice of breaking up families at our borders. But in reality, the order simply furthers the Trump administration's anti-immigrant policies by continuing to conflate immigration issues with criminal ones. This hidden goal is revealed once we examine how the current ""zero tolerance"" policy is limited by the 1997 settlement of the legal case Flores v. Reno.

Shan Wu

The ""zero tolerance"" policy seeks to deter people from seeking to enter our country by imprisoning as many of these people as possible. The policy achieves this by looking for all possible criminal violations. Once a criminal charge can be found, then the person seeking entry can be detained on a criminal charge and their children separated from them due to an existing policy barring children from being detained in criminal detention centers.

Understanding the insidious nature of this plan starts with knowing that immigration proceedings are civil in nature and not criminal. For example, asylum-seekers are not criminal defendants and therefore not processed in criminal courts. For this reason, asylum families would not normally be separated at the border unless prosecutors can find a criminal charge to use against the asylum-seeker.

Indeed, prior to the zero tolerance policy, thousands of people in civil deportation proceedings would not have been in the criminal court process either. But the zero tolerance policy has been used to change the status of thousands of non-criminal immigration cases into criminal cases simply by charging ""illegal entry"" and busing them from deportation facilities to criminal courts to plead guilty to minor misdemeanors. The punishment often has been nothing more than a fine and time served

This deliberate conversion of non-criminal cases into criminal cases is what triggered the separating of thousands of children from their families at the border and what led to President Trump signing his executive order stopping this practice. But what the executive Ooder really does is to expand the ability of Trump administration to incarcerate people seeking entry into our country by directing DOJ to re-negotiate the settlement in Flores v. Reno.

Sara Elhassan is a 33-year-old Sudanese-American freelance writer and editor based between Phoenix, Arizona and Khartoum, Sudan. Her Instagram story on Noura Hussein helped spark the #JusticeForNoura campaign. The views expressed in this commentary her own.

On May 1, I turned on my phone, opened my Instagram account and shared Noura Hussein's story.

While her case was just starting to spread on WhatsApp groups among the Sudanese diaspora, it was the first time that many of my friends, family and followers had ever heard about Noura, the Sudanese teenager on death row for killing her husband, who she says raped her after their forced marriage.

But in the weeks since, her case has sparked international outrage, human rights campaigns and several hashtags, including #JusticeforNoura.

When I found out about Noura's case through WhatsApp, it had been almost a year since her arrest, and a day since she was convicted of premeditated murder.

What made Noura's story so unusual was that she had killed her attacker.

Sharing Noura's story on Instagram was a reflex, a coping mechanism to deal with the intense frustration I felt -- not only at the great injustice that this young woman had faced at the hands of her family and the Sudanese justice system, but also that such a major case had flown under our collective radar

What made Noura's story so unusual was that she had killed her attacker.

But the circumstances that led to this chain of events -- child marriage, forced marriage, marital rape -- are neither new nor uncommon in Sudan, where more than a third of girls are married before their 18th birthday, according to UNICEF

Discussing Noura's case with people thousands of miles away was a way for me to engage with an issue I felt was in need of immediate attention. It was also a way to acknowledge the countless number of women across Sudan and the diaspora, those I knew personally and those I didn't, who had suffered similar fates and to whom society had turned a blind eye.

As with most of the Instagram stories I create, I had hoped that this would prompt people to engage with their friends and families on this issue. But the reach it garnered, the outpouring of support and the flood of messages I received defied my expectations.

What began as just an Instagram story grew into a veritable movement that has captured worldwide attention.

Her story has inadvertently created a space for people to engage in a wider discussion about gender-based violence in Sudanese society — an issue that is both pervasive and taboo.

I have watched in awe as individuals have mobilized around Noura's case -- not only on the ground, but across the diaspora and the globe. Among their kind acts have been countless letters written in support of Noura, to keep her morale up.

Her story has inadvertently created a space for people to engage in a wider discussion about gender-based violence in Sudanese society — an issue that is both pervasive and taboo. One Twitter thread inspired by #JusticeForNoura captured stories from Sudanese women and men who shared their experiences of sexual assault and violence.

As with the #MeToo movement, the #JusticeForNoura campaign has not only given Noura a voice, but survivors too, empowering them to fight the taboo culture that forces them into silence. It is tangible proof of the power of social media for providing a platform for women's voices.

Today, as we anxiously await the judge's ruling on Noura's appeal, it is comforting to know that it is not only the Sudanese people who stand with her, but the world.",Sudan: How the #JusticeForNoura Instagram campaign gave a voice to the voiceless,http://cnn.com/2018/06/21/opinions/noura-hussein-social-media-campaign-elhassan-asequals-intl/index.html

(CNN) Pregnant and fearing for her unborn's life, a woman fled a death threat from a drug cartel in Honduras and made her way to America, delivering her baby girl, Andrea, along the way.

Reaching the US border at the Hidalgo Port of Entry, she saw a daunting sight: Border guards blocking asylum-seekers from crossing into America on the pedestrian walkway.

After several days of unsuccessfully asking to enter to plead her case for asylum, she spotted a man making a few bucks washing windshields, and asked to borrow an extra squeegee. One car at a time, she told us, she made her way from Mexico up to the port of entry, posing as a windshield washer. When she finally reached the threshold, she was able to enter the United States and seek asylum.

But under Attorney General Jeff Sessions' new standards for asylum — which could exclude those, like her, who are fleeing deadly gang threats — she may not qualify. What will become of her and her 65-day-old baby?

Another young woman, hanging her head with hopelessness and resignation, told us how she presented herself for asylum at an official border point, where she was charged with ""illegally"" crossing the border. She sits in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center with no idea if she will see her child again and no legal representation. Will she ever see her toddler again?

Yet another mother was panicked over her child's health, because the border guards who took her son from her hadn't recorded his medical needs. ""Why wouldn't they ask?"" she demanded, throwing up her hands and shaking her head, defeated by her concerns and frustrations. How will she find out about her son's health?

Imagine coming to a foreign country, not speaking the language, and suddenly your baby is taken from your arms and disappears. Imagine the terror that child feels, and the hopeless anguish of a mom who knows she is powerless to comfort her toddler. Imagine the impossible frustration of demanding day after day to know where your child is, without getting a clear answer.

This anguish has been caused by an administrative policy by President Donald Trump and US Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Under their "" zero-tolerance policy ,"" anyone crossing the border without a visa — even those seeking asylum and even, in at least one case we saw, those attempting to cross at checkpoints — is considered a criminal. This means that their children are torn out of their arms and crammed into makeshift facilities, as the parents are put in ICE detention or in overflow beds in federal prisons. While conflicting reports from the administration have suggested this policy may be temporarily on hold, the fact remains: This ""zero-tolerance"" policy is a zero-humanity policy that makes zero sense.

Our Democratic House of Representatives colleagues -- Reps. David Cicilline, Vicente Gonzalez, Sheila Jackson Lee, Mark Pocan, and Peter Welch -- joined us on Father's Day to visit the facilities where these individuals are being held. It is clear that parents and children are sitting in limbo, with virtually no access to legal advice or representation.

In this Kafkaesque system, even if you have a completely valid reason to seek refuge in the United States, you have virtually no way to prepare a solid case for asylum, no reliable way to contact your children, and no guarantee that you will ever see them again.

This is not the American way. The symbol of our nation is the Statue of Liberty, which carries the message ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."" We have replaced her torch, that beacon of hope for centuries, with handcuffs.

Trump and Sessions must heed the cries of Americans of both parties and end this stain on our nation. The President and his administration created this policy, and the President could pick up the phone right now and end it.

On Wednesday, President Trump -- clearly feeling the pressure -- announced a new strategy, claiming he is ending this affliction against children. But the administration's moves point to a new long-term strategy, one of family internment. The answer to one policy that inflicts pain on children is not to replace it with a new policy that inflicts pain on children. Imprisoning children along with their parents is never acceptable. ""Handcuffs for all"" is no solution at all. What's more, the President has not addressed how -- or if -- all 2,300 children who have already been separated will be reunited with their parents -- a heartbreaking uncertainty for many of these families.

It is important that President Trump understand firsthand the enormity of the harm his policy has caused. So as a group, we have invited him to meet with us so we can share what we have seen and heard.

Better yet, we challenge President Trump and the architects of his policy -- Sessions, adviser Stephen Miller, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, and chief of staff John Kelly -- to visit the same facilities we did, and to see where children have been torn away from their parents, to hear their cries, to witness their small bodies wrapped in space blankets leaning against chain-link fences or sitting on concrete floors.

We challenge the President and attorney general to visit the federal prisons and ICE detention facilities where stressed, frantic parents go day after day with little or no information about their or their children's future, where people who tried to escape persecution are now sitting at plastic tables in prison scrubs.

We have personally spoken to the victims of the Trump administration policies. We have seen firsthand that Trump and Sessions are inflicting brutal pain and suffering. And everything we have seen has borne out what child experts across many different fields have said: that this policy inflicts irreparable trauma on children.

There is a better way. We can have secure borders and process asylum cases humanely while protecting these innocent children. The Department of Homeland Security has used alternatives to detention that have demonstrated positive results and have been more cost-effective than draconian detention policies. They should pursue those alternatives again.

It's time for all Americans -- every person who cares more about the well-being of children than party lines -- to contact the Justice Department, the White House, the Department of Homeland Security, and their representatives in Congress and demand an end to any policy that hurts children as a deterrence strategy.

(CNN) As with any tragedy there is shock -- this is what America's allies are experiencing right now. Other emotions will follow: anger, resentment, and the desire for retribution likely among them.

The tragedy for America's allies is that 70 years of mutually profitable, security-enhancing relations are coming apart.

The shock is worse because the attacker causing the rift is on the inside. Even before he arrived at the G7 meeting, President Donald Trump was lobbing diplomatic grenades. Canada, France, Germany, Britain, Japan and Italy should have seen it coming.

In the days prior to the meeting in Canada, Trump, the kingpin in the alliance, had been ratcheting up increasingly caustic rhetoric over trade tariffs. And US allies were pushing back.

Then moments before leaving Washington for Quebec he called for the G7 to re-admit Russia , making it a G8 again.

It was an intentional uninvited distraction -- an increasingly frequent hallmark of Trump's abrasive diplomacy that takes time from more pressing issues.

Russia's participation in the gathering was never an intended focus on the agenda. The country was expelled four years ago for invading Ukraine and annexing Crimea.

Trump was telegraphing his combative strategy even before landing in Canada -- and further signals came in his late arrival, failure to show up on time for some meetings and early departure.

This photograph taken mid-gathering speaks volumes as an indication of what was said behind closed doors.

Both British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron talked of difficult conversations, but pointed to the joint communique, a list of agreements, to be signed by all. In the words of Macron, it ""marks a collective desire to stabilize things.""

After leaving the meeting early, Trump tweeted that he was reneging on signing the communique and blasted Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. It was this reversal that spoke loudest of all, amplifying his already abundant disdain for allies.

There is now, among those allies, a bitter aftertaste. Questions that were rarely asked previously will now surface: ""How did we not see this coming?"" ""For how long have we gone unappreciated?""

Now America's allies are staring down the twin barrels of estrangement and separation.

We are not there yet, but when one partner acts out of character, it will lead to questions among the others. The G7 fiasco has become just such a catalyst. Troubles that have been brewing have been brought to the surface with nowhere to hide.

It has become accepted that this is Trump's style: Throw the old order up in the air and create new structures from the chaos. Just before the G7 summit, Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, was recorded saying , ""I have become more and more convinced that there is method in his madness.""

Referring to how Trump might handle Brexit, he said, ""He'd go in bloody hard ... There'd be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he'd gone mad. But, actually, you might get somewhere.""

Inside the G7, according to his own tweet, Trump hit it off with Italy's new populist Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. But neither Johnson nor Conte are in the mainstream of his allies.

So what could the new post-G7 order look like, absent swift rapprochement?

In the short term, an escalating trade war. If nothing changes, maybe a Europe cast off from the US, where regional energy and security concerns become their own preserve.

A future where Russia feels less caged by its fears of a mobile democratic curtain and China, unbridled by a united alliance opposing its expansionism, loosens its own fetters and engages in increasingly footloose foreign adventures.

But none of this need be. The question facing America's allies now: Is Trump America?

Regardless of who is in office, is this what we have to contend with?

Republican Sen. John McCain and former FBI chief James Comey have been quick to say no.

The reality facing G7 allies though is one of its own choosing. America is isolating itself, as Trump replaces traditional diplomacy with bullying, backed up by an army of surrogates.

None of that is an easy sell for the allies, which could mean problems for Trump in the future.

Allies are allies because, when you need them, they are there. They are made pliable through the stroking of their egos, not by rubbing them the wrong way.

But no leader at the G7 acts alone. They can only back Trump when they have the political capital at home to do it.

And on that front Trump is crimping his own power.

Macron tried warming his electorate to Trump but that bromance blew up over trade tariffs several weeks ago.

Britain's May is bracing for large street protests next month when Trump comes to the UK to meet her and the Queen.

She has already been criticized for her closeness to Trump and, given her weakened political standing, will be all too aware of how former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's political career was truncated by his support for President George W. Bush in Iraq.

Last year more than 1.8 million Brits signed a petition demanding Trump be denied a Royal audience.

In a post-Quebec world, where allies answer Trump's claims about trade imbalances, disappointment and disillusionment in America is going to reach electorates fast.

Division begets more of the same.

The allies' relationships with America are already reshaping. Nothing is irreversible yet, but Trump is accelerating towards a point of no easy return.","After the shock, allies will react to Trump with anger and retribution",http://cnn.com/2018/06/11/opinions/after-the-shock-of-trumps-treatment-of-allies-robertson/index.html
284,284,2018-02-26 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Sexting among teens and younger children has increased over the past decade and poses a growing challenge for educators and parents, according to a new study .

One in four young people said they'd received sexts, and one in seven reported sending them, according to the study, which was published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. The research included data from 39 separate research projects conducted between January 1990 and June 2016, with a total of 110,380 participants, all of whom were under 18 -- with some as young as 11.

The researchers focused on data since 2008 and found an increase in sexting among young people.

The increased number of young people involved in sending or receiving sexually explicit photographs or messages has corresponded with rapidly expanding access to cell phones.

With that trend in mind, the study's authors suggest that ""age specific information on sexting and its potential consequences should regularly be provided as a component of sex education.""

Why sext?

The researchers found that younger people engage in sexting in large part as a way to begin exploring attraction to other people.

""As teens get older, we are going to see increasing numbers ... who sext. Just as we see with actual sexual behavior,"" said study co-author Jeff Temple, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Medical Branch.

""It's not terribly surprising considering as teens age, their interest in sexuality is heightened. They are trying to figure out who they are.""

Kami Kosenko, a communications professor at North Carolina State University, agreed: ""As individuals become more comfortable talking about sex and interact with more potential sexual partners, we would expect to see them engage in more sexual communication, of which sexting is a part."" Kosenko was not directly involved in the study.

Teens sometimes 'assume safety'

The study predicts a similar upward trend in sexting among younger teens and preteens. Coupled with a lack of awareness of the risks involved, especially among younger children, that is a cause for concern, the researchers said.

Preteens can be particularly vulnerable to the pitfalls of sexting. Relationships among tweens (children 10 to 12) are often short-lived, and that makes individuals more vulnerable to having sexts forwarded without consent or being subject to sextortion: the use of nude images and or videos as a form of threat or blackmail.

""As tweens and kid smartphone ownership gets younger and younger, we are going to see an increase in the number of teens who are sexting,"" Temple said.

On average, children in the study were 10.3 years old when they got their first smartphones.

Danger also arises from messaging apps that give the impression that videos and images shared or stored are private, although this may not be the case.

""Teens can sometimes assume safety or security is embedded in these apps when it's not,"" said study co-author Sheri Madigan, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Calgary.

""Kids don't really have a clear understanding of cause and effect,"" Madigan said. ""When they send a picture, they may not recognize they cant get it back or that it is really up to the recipient to decide how they are going to treat that picture.""

Kosenko said that ""with youth acquiring cell phones at younger and younger ages, we should be concerned about their digital and physical safety.""

Part of the problem lies in the children's brains, Madigan said. ""Younger teens who have less developed frontal lobes are less able to think through things than older teens. They are likely more vulnerable to being coerced into sexting or to participate in nonconsensual sexting.""

There is little or no literature on tweens and sexting, according to Madigan, who suggests that it is important to do further research on the topic.

Nonconsensual sexting

According to the study, 12.5% of young people -- or one out of every eight -- report that they have been forwarded a sext without consent from the sender and/or the receiver.

""That is why this concept of digital safety and security is so important: because we know that this is happening. We know that sexts are being forwarded without consent, so if parents are having conversations with their teens about sexting, they can talk about those potential risks,"" Madigan said.

Nonconsensual sexting can take a toll on a teen's health.

""If we look at things like sexual behavior with teens, if it's consensual and both teens wanted it and are OK with it, you are not going to see the negative psychological health. If it was nonconsensual or coerced, that is where you see the negative mental health problems, and we see the same thing with sexting,"" Temple said.

According to the study, further research needs to be conducted on nonconsensual sexting ""to appropriately target and inform intervention, education, and policy efforts.""

What parents need to know

JAMA Pediatrics defines sexting as ""the sending or receiving of nude or seminude images or sexually explicit text messages."" This can happen voluntarily in a relationship or when a teenager is asked to ""prove"" how much they like someone. It can also happen without consent.

Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.

The biggest concern, according to the journal, is the possibility of photos or messages being spread to other people. Sexting can cause severe emotional distress, which is why it is important to talk with children about it. The researchers suggest:

Start the discussion early with your kids using broad questions such as ""have you heard of sexting?"" By understanding what your child already knows, you can then frame your conversation.

Use examples appropriate for your child's age. Be specific about the possible consequences of sexting. ""Parents should be proactive and not reactive,"" Madigan said.

Remind your teenager of their own worth. Let them know that being pressured is not OK and that sexting is not a way to ""prove"" their love. ""If you have the conversation early and often, when problems arise, then kids know they can go to their parents and talk to them,"" Madigan said.

Being open and withholding judgment are keys to a successful interaction with a young person about sexting, Kosenko said.

""This means that demonizing sexting won't work. Also, don't assume that you are the expert on the subject or the one who should lead the discussion,"" she said.

""You might be tempted to tell your children to ask you if they have questions, but consider what can be gained by letting your children tell you what they know and think about sexting.""","1 in 4 young people has been sexted, study finds",http://cnn.com/2018/02/26/health/youth-sexting-prevalence-study/index.html
285,285,2018-06-19 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Filippo Grandi is the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Henrietta H. Fore is the Executive Director of UNICEF. The views expressed are their own.

Ayman is a Syrian refugee. He runs not because he has hopes of becoming one of the refugee Olympians, whose stories of courage lit up Rio 2016. Or even because he is particularly interested in sport.

He practices running, he says, because his mother and father were killed in Syria's seven-year war and one day he might have to flee again.

Ayman has reason to train. In 2017, every two seconds someone was forced to flee due to persecution, conflict or violence.

There are 68.5 million forcibly displaced people, the equivalent of the entire population of France. More than half of the world's refugees are children. Over 173,800 refugee and asylum-seeking children are separated from their families or have been forced to flee on their own. It is in their lives -- and their shattered futures -- that the most devastating consequences of war, violence and persecution play out.

As the world's conflicts have multiplied and intensified over the past few years to create millions more refugees and displaced people, governments seem to have overlooked their duty of care to children. Perhaps it is because the statistics can be so staggering that they harden us to the human suffering that underpins them.

Support must be stepped up to help these countries in their efforts to include refugee children in national education, health and social protection systems. We cannot build a future by shunting refugee children away into a parallel system of education comprising outdated materials, improvised school buildings or untrained teachers. Their lives are placed at risk when they are turned away from state-run hospitals and clinics, forcing them to look for unofficial sources of medical advice and practice.

Many refugee emergencies all over the world have evolved from short-term crises into protracted situations. This means there are multiple generations of refugees who have known nothing but exile. Aid must be more than food, water and shelter. It needs to include protection, education, health care, access to jobs, and a thread of hope for those whom the world has cast adrift.

UNICEF and UNHCR assert that all children on the move, no matter why or how they were uprooted, should receive the same care and compassion as any other child. Children are first and foremost children -- and regardless of their nationality, their legal status, or that of their parents, their welfare and rights must be at the center of our actions.

We should welcome, nurture and invest in refugee children wherever they are. They are remarkably adaptable. They will learn the language and make local friends , if they are only given the chance to do so. Allowed to flourish -- through a safe environment, education, and opportunities, they will contribute to the societies that host them, and help rebuild their countries when peace allows them to go home.

Achieving this needs a radically new approach that engages national governments, local communities, donors, development agencies, businesses, faith organizations and all those who can play a role in protecting and supporting refugees.

A new model for a more predictable and comprehensive refugee response, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2016, is already driving change . It paves the way for a new global compact on refugees that will be presented to the world body later this year

Properly implemented, it aims to transform the way the world responds to the plight of refugee children and their families. This includes investments in refugee hosting communities and fair and humane asylum policies that allow refugees to live in safe and dignified conditions. More opportunities to resettle, be reunited with families, study and work abroad will reduce the need for perilous journeys.

286,286,2018-06-22 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) At a campaign rally in Istanbul, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan plays an animation on a huge screen to thousands of supporters, touting plans for an opera house on Taksim Square.

He paces back and forth on stage, listing his achievements for Turkey: New roads, better hospitals, more public transportation, more airports. At every rally, he hammers home the same message -- he has transformed Turkey into a new modern nation.

In almost every speech, 64-year-old Erdogan disparages what he calls ""old Turkey,"" a place where garbage piled up on the streets, public hospitals were overrun, and roads were dimly-lit, single-lane death traps.

That message of transformation has delivered Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) 12 electoral victories over the last 16 years, making Erdogan the Turkish Republic's longest-serving leader since it was founded in 1923.

But the President faces his toughest political challenge yet , in snap elections Sunday that Erdogan himself called. Turkish voters go to the polls to elect both a president and a new parliament, and for the first time in more than a decade, they have an array of strong candidates to choose from.

Erdogan's grandiose rallies have become an expected part of any Turkish election, but they appear to have been eclipsed Wednesday, as main opposition candidate Muharrem Ince drew what looked like the largest crowd in the elections period yet.

In the town of Izmir, hundreds of thousands of Ince supporters in a sea of red Turkish flags stretched for kilometers down a promenade on the Aegean coast, as the charismatic former high school physics teacher promised to end the nepotism of the Erdogan government.

""Erdogan is tired, he has no joy and he is arrogant,"" he said.

""On the one hand you have a tired man, and on the other you have fresh blood.""

Hundreds of thousands of supporters gather to listen to Muharrem Ince in Izmir on June 21, three days ahead of the vote.

Muharrem Ince at a campaign rally on June 10.

Erdogan has consolidated power at every step of his career. He has crushed anti-government protests, and in 2013 he evaded a corruption investigation into his inner circle. After a failed military coup to remove his government from power in 2016, he eliminated his opponents by firing tens of thousands of government workers, gutting public institutions, jailing critical voices, and clamping down on the media. He narrowly won a referendum last year that will change Turkey's parliamentary system to an executive presidency, giving whoever wins Sunday's vote sweeping new powers.

But Erdogan's mantra of development and growth has lost some of its luster recently as Turkish people feel the pinch of a faltering economy.

The lira has lost some 20% of its value since the year began, inflation is at 12% and interest rates are around a painful 18%. Some voters are tiring of what they see as Erdogan's power-grabbing.

Turkish people are feeling the pinch of 12% inflation.

""It's a situation where Erdogan can't blame anyone else. It's not like the government is run by someone else so he can turn around and say 'elect me so I can improve the economy.' That's his weak spot and he knows it,"" said Asli Aydintasbas, a Senior Fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

But at the Istanbul rally, diehard Erdogan supporter Gulbahar Turan is sure Erdogan's AKP can continue to deliver. She says foreign intervention -- not government mismanagement -- is what's driving the economic woes.

""These are games by foreign powers, but they should know even a dead Erdogan would get votes,"" Turan said.

Erdogan's biggest threat

Polls in Turkey are typically partisan and unreliable, but Erdogan appears to be in front. Some polls suggest he will fail to win 50% of the vote, and that will mean a run-off round on July 8. This could be a particularly dangerous position for Erdogan to find himself in, as most opposition parties have vowed to galvanize their supporters to whoever challenges the incumbent leader.

Opposition candidates and parties are trying to steal support from Erdogan on all fronts. Conservative nationalist Meral Aksener threatens him from the center right, while Temel Karamollaoglu from the Islamist Felicity Party could also drive pious conservatives away from the AKP.

But Erdogan's biggest threat is the formidable Ince, who has galvanized the center-left around the CHP.

In the past, the CHP fielded fairly drab candidates. This election is the first in which the party has chosen someone charismatic, Aydintasbas said.

""We are already seeing the results in the sense that this is a race between Muharrem Ince and Erdogan. And that's never happened before. Erdogan had it too easy and he basically ran against himself,"" Aydintasbas said.

Ince is a not an obscure name in Turkey; the 54-year-old has served as a member of parliament for the last 16 years. He has managed to broaden his party's appeal beyond its usual base of secular upper-middle-class voters to include pious Muslims and Kurds.

""Former leaders of the party were bureaucrats or statesmen,"" said Behlul Ozkan, a political scientist from Marmara University. ""Ince, with his rural family roots, his truck driver father and headscarf-wearing mother and sister is different from his predecessors.""

During the holy month of Ramadan, when Ince made appearances with his sister who wears a headscarf, he made clear he would continue to guarantee women's right to wear the Islamic headdress in public spaces, including universities.

The Islamic headscarf was prohibited in public life in the aftermath of a soft coup in 1997. Women who wore it were barred from going to university, practicing medicine and law, and serving as members of parliament, until Erdogan started lifting those restrictions in 2013.

Ince has been reaching out to the Kurds, Turkey's largest ethnic minority, whose vote is usually split between Erdogan's AKP and the pro-Kurdish leftist Peoples' Democracy Party (HDP).

Muharrem Ince arriving at the Istanbul rally on June 10.

At the start of the campaign, Ince won favor with Kurdish voters by visiting HDP candidate Selahattin Demirtas, who is in jail pending the outcome of a court case in which the government accuses him of terrorism, allegations that his party says are politically motivated. He has been running his campaign from inside prison mainly over a Twitter account run by his advisers.

In a rare occurrence for a CHP politician, the turnout at an Ince rally in the predominantly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir was high.

The Kurdish vote is pivotal in the outcome of the parliamentary election. If the HDP crosses a 10% threshold, it will win seats and could deprive the AKP of its parliamentary majority. If it fails to get into parliament, the AKP will sweep up those seats.

'People are sick and tired': Ince

Erodgan and the AKP now dominate the airwaves in Turkey, so Ince, locked out from the mainstream media, has been trying to reach his base and beyond through a breakneck campaign schedule . And he has been hitting Erdogan where he's most vulnerable -- the economy.

""Erdogan, people are cooking stones instead of food. People are cooking their worries instead of food. Look at the prices of potatoes, of onions. There is no bread!"" Ince shouted out over the crowd at a recent campaign rally in the southern city of Antalya.

""Come, let's have a debate. Let's talk about the struggle of getting by, of paying the rent, of sending the kids to school.""

In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Ince said it was time for change.

""I believe in the power of the street. I believe in our people's wish for change. People are sick and tired. Turkey is sick and tired. Institutions have been taken over. Turkey's democracy has been destroyed. A single man rules over Turkey. Turkey has to find a way out of this,"" he said.

He is reaching out to Turkey's youth as well. A group of students hanging out at an Istanbul cafe say they don't know much about the old Turkey Erdogan talks about -- to them the old Turkey was the one of several years ago, when there were greater civil liberties. They refuse to give their names, lamenting the loss of freedom of speech.

""I don't want to give you my name because I need to think about my future,"" said a 22-year-old physiology student. ""That is a worry I just don't want to have anymore.""

A worker looks at the control tower of a new airport under construction in Istanbul on April 13.

Another student said that providing services and development should be expected from a government, not something for Erdogan to brag about. ""Roads, roads, roads. I don't want to talk about that. I want to talk about more,"" he said.

But development is a message that has worked for Erdogan for 16 years. Back at his rally in Istanbul, as his opera house presentation draws to a close, he asks, ""How do you like that?"" to the crowd, which roars back with approval.

He calls out to the control room again for his next presentation, new building plans for an island development and then another for a park.",Erdogan's gamble on snap elections in Turkey could backfire,http://cnn.com/2018/06/22/europe/erdogan-turkey-elections-intl/index.html
287,287,2018-05-26 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Petros, Tennessee (CNN) Fifty years ago, a career criminal named James Earl Ray traveled from Atlanta to Memphis, stalking the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The civil rights leader was there to energize a strike of sanitation workers asking for better working conditions and higher pay. Ray was there to assassinate him.

While King stood on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel (now a museum for peace), Ray accomplished his sinister goal with a single shot from more than 200 feet away.

Over the next two months, while on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives List, Ray was on the run, traveling to Europe on a false passport. He was eventually caught at London's Heathrow Airport. He pleaded guilty to avoid a jury trial and the death penalty, was sentenced to 99 years and sent to Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in eastern Tennessee, surrounded by thick wooded hills.

In its day, it was considered one of the toughest state prisons, where inmates frequently killed each other. In the novel ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" Dr. Hannibal Lecter negotiates a transfer to the prison.

Brushy was also nearly impossible to escape, but Ray managed it with the help of six other convicts in 1977. All were recaptured within days, though ""rescued"" is probably the better description. Cold, hunger and disorientation brought them to their knees, and their own fiction-worthy plot turned from ""The Great Escape"" to ""Blair Witch Project.""

Ray himself traveled only 8 miles in a little over two days, a detail that made one local long-distance runner, Gary Cantrell, think to himself that he could make it 100 miles in that amount of time.

And thus the seed of the Barkley Marathons was planted.

Man vs. land

Cantrell, whose nickname is ""Lazarus Lake,"" or ""Laz"" as he is known by everyone, was further inspired to start his own race by this rugged land he knew so well. The name ""brushy"" is fitting for a rural area thick with undergrowth, briars and hidden obstacles that inflict cuts, bruises and falls. It's so dense, you can't see the top of any of the peaks from the bottom.

These mountains, where a day hike can be a challenge, are where truly competitive racing should be held, he thought, not on a flat, paved, well-marked course.

The Barkley consists of five loops of 20 miles each (though runners swear it's more like a marathon-length 26 miles). All told, it has about 67,000 feet of elevation -- from sea level to the peak of Mount Everest is 29,000 feet -- not that the other 67,000 feet of descent are much easier.

The loops are run back to back over three sleepless days and nights, on unmarked trails. Runners must trace the course from a topographical map hours before the race begins. Most other distance races -- with their clear routes, aid stations, teams of helpful volunteers and throngs of encouraging spectators -- are designed so racers finish, but the Barkley is designed so racers fail.

And fail they do. Of more than 1,000 who've entered, only 15 have completed the full distance in time. ""It's a good place for your ego to take a beating,"" Laz said before this year's race, sporting a red beanie labeled ""Geezer."" His insightful quips are often followed by a cackle of delight, like the Yoda of the runner's world.

Among ultramarathoners, the Barkley is considered one of the hardest -- a superlative that is subjective, of course. There are footraces that cross deserts, traverse tall mountains and even go greater distances than Barkley's 100 or 130 or so miles. But it's the unique combination of impediments, punishing conditions and lack of assistance that makes this race the stuff of legend. It's even the subject of a documentary; a cameraman had to be rescued by rangers more than 12 hours after he got lost.

It's only in the face of such opposition that the highest peak physical and mental experiences are achieved. That's the idea, anyway. Among ultramarathoners and elite trail runners, the Barkley is the Holy Grail of races.

How it works (or doesn't)

For a competition that thumbs its nose at conventional rules, this anti-race race does have a number of parameters in which it operates (not written down, of course), all to maximize the challenge. Some of the choice unwritten rules include:

No GPS or phones.

The only permitted technology is a cheap watch from Walmart, handed out by Laz to each runner and synchronized to his watch. Unmanned checkpoints (13 this year), which are paperback books.

You rip out the page that corresponds to your bib number to prove that you reached it. You must have all the book pages in hand at the end of each loop. The books are hidden under rocks or taped to trees, usually. 60-hour cutoff. Two years ago, Gary Robbins got turned around in his exhaustion with only 2 miles to go, arriving at the campground a few seconds over time, disqualified not just for missing the time cutoff but for going off-route.

Two years ago, Gary Robbins got turned around in his exhaustion with only 2 miles to go, arriving at the campground a few seconds over time, disqualified not just for missing the time cutoff but for going off-route. No aid stations. Philosophical Laz: ""Being totally free doesn't come without risk.""

Philosophical Laz: ""Being totally free doesn't come without risk."" No outside assistance.

No friends and family to meet you with food or socks except at the camp between loops. No hints as to the location of checkpoints or map secrets. This year's theme, according to cackling Yoda-esque Laz: ""Help is not coming."" Start time TBD.

A conch is blown one hour before the race starts, but that can be anywhere between midnight and noon. ""The uncertainty is half the fun,"" Laz said with a chortle, ""and one of the hardest things to deal with."" Entry fee is $1.60, a pair of socks (this year) and an essay. Other ultras charge hundreds of dollars, but Laz isn't in it for the money, though he's partial to a specific brand of dress sock.

Thousands apply every year, and only 40 are chosen. Just figuring out how to apply is a challenge: There's no website, email or physical address posted anywhere.

Laz, as he is known by everyone, was inspired to create the Barkley Marathons by the local land and a prison escape by Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassin.

Would-be runners write an essay on why they should be allowed to compete, and Laz chooses among these, factoring in their arguments or, in some cases, poetry but also their proven ability to endure. Finishers tend to have bona fides that include setting speed records on famous long-distance national trails or climbing the highest peaks in the world. If accepted, runners get a ""letter of condolence"" and told the date of the race (also a secret), and they must bring a license plate of some variety to the race site that are strung up in walls of metallic memory.

'Good luck, morons'

This year's lucky (or maybe unlucky) runners -- 31 men, nine women -- gathered on a chilly April evening at a campground at Frozen Head State Park the day before the race. A single copy of the course map sat on a table as runners took turns tracing the route on their own topographical maps. The route changes in parts from year to year, and sometimes a peak is added. Veterans know to laminate them in clear tape to avoid disintegration from the elements.

Four or five pages of Laz's enigmatic and wry instructions are also handed out. These mainly help runners find the checkpoint books, which often have tongue-in-cheek titles such as ""Where Do We Go From Here"" and ""A Time to Die."" I asked one runner whether I could take a quick look at the instructions, and he seemed wary of handing over such well-kept secrets to a representative of a global media organization. One (non-identifiable) passage read, ""You will be able to make out the trail that climbs directly to pulloff, unless it is foggy, then you will have to guess.""

Chicken and beans, cooked over an open fire, were served as part of a potluck the evening before the race started. There is little to no alcohol, as that's not conducive to running 100-plus miles. Runners greet each other warmly and exchange war stories of past Barkleys. It's a rarified club to which they belong. A cake read, ""Good luck, morons.""

Because you don't know when the race is going to start, it makes for a fitful night's sleep, lest you miss the sound of the conch. This sleep-depriving FOMO was exacerbated by the cacophony of heavy rain pounding on the tents most of the night.

Mercifully, or just randomly, Laz gave everyone a full night of whatever sleep they could get, and the conch was blown at 8:30 a.m., under clear skies. When runners gathered an hour later to start, Laz gave few remarks, none particularly encouraging. After reading the names of Barkley veterans who died over the years, Laz removed his hat, and a bugler played taps, the traditional song of military funerals.

Tradition dictates that the start of the race is signaled by Laz lighting a Camel cigarette. Runners started trotting past him as he made his first exhale. The course begins with a steady incline that will reach 1,600 feet of elevation within just the first mile and a half or, as Laz described it, ""the easiest hill they'll do all day. After that, it turns ugly.""

Although he's done his fair share of endurance running (including a 318-mile course) and long-distance hiking (he's currently walking from Tennessee to Oregon), Laz has never competed in the Barkley himself. Neither has his friend Barry Barkley, for whom he named the race.

'4/5 Pure Joy, 1/5 Pure Hell'

The details of the race are a well-guarded secret, and they won't be divulged here. The names of landmarks in the instructions -- Quitter's Road, Rat Jaw -- don't correspond to labels on any official map.

The one portion that's not a secret is Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary, which closed for prison business in 2009. Barkley runners jump into a creek and wade through a tunnel that goes under the jail, emerging just steps away from the wall that Ray and his fellow escapees jumped. You can arrange a tour inside the crumbling prison. Ray's cell was No. 27. My guide repeated that the place is haunted without a wink or any indication that she was kidding.

The race takes place every spring, a season when weather fluctuates from warm and muggy one hour to freezing and wet the next. Some years, there has been snow to run through and temperatures 10 degrees below freezing.

""This is the only place you can have 45-mile-per-hour winds and pea soup fog,"" Laz said, pausing for his punch line: ""at the same time."" This year, it started pleasantly cool and cloudy, but rain and cold punished them as the hours went by.

Between each loop, runners will eat, doctor their feet, maybe steal a quick nap. Some rest at base camp as little at 15 minutes, others an hour before being given a new bib number (to get a new page from the checkpoints). The direction of the race changes between loops as well, adding another level of difficulty and more orienteering. In the first four loops, two are clockwise, two counter-clockwise. If more than one runner makes it to the fifth loop, each runner is sent in opposing directions for the final marathon.

No one made it past three loops this year. Just over half made it to the second loop, five made it to the third loop, and only one finished the third. As racers dropped out, a bugler played taps. Like some previous years, it was played 40 times. Laz thought two factors that led to the lack of finishers this year were the weather and that he chose fewer Barkley veterans than usual.

Finishing is so rare, there is a web page of quotes on what the experience was like. Brett Maune, 2011's only finisher, calculated ""4/5 Pure Joy, 1/5 Pure Hell.""

Andrew Thompson finished in 2009, after setting the speed record for the 2,160-mile Appalachian Trail in 47½ days. ""Finishing [the Barkley] was not at all what I expected,"" he wrote. ""All the emotion and hoopla and sense of accomplishment with which I had begun Loop 5 were quickly worn down to nubs. The 'victory' lap quickly turned into survival mode. I was sick, and cold, and damn happy to be done.""

Only one person, Jared Campbell, has finished the race three times. ""I am thrilled,"" he said after finishing in 2016, ""setting a new personal standard for how much adventure I can extract out of $1.60."" In 2014, he was more philosophical: ""There are lessons in life that can only be learned through fairly massive deviations from our normal, comfortable routines. They can sharpen our optimism and generate a deeper appreciation for the simple things in life."" And in 2012, he was nearly psychedelic: ""Due to some extreme foot pain (skin) and sleep deprivation I experienced an incredible distillation of my physical and mental self down to a few basic senses and thoughts, which was both an educational and beautiful experience.""

In 2013, finisher Nickademus Hollon quoted Plato: ""The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself.""

'A different breed'

To reach the Barkley, you will have done massive amounts of trail and endurance running -- even for the annual ""human sacrifice,"" as Laz playfully labels one person who he predicts doesn't have the right stuff.

But if you're just getting into trail running or adventure racing, you have to put in your vertical hours. Many long-distance runners train in intervals, also known as periodization, building strength by alternating hard and easy weeks of exertion and recovery. Most of the runners in the Barkley run ultra-distances year-round so don't need a training program that starts with short runs.

In the case of the Barkley or other unmarked trail races, it is also essential to be able to read a topographical map, something of a dying skill as technology and a lack of wooded adventure rob us of it.

Unlike the documentary crew member and King's killer, no Barkley runner has ever got so lost in the area's woods (Laz: ""100% self-extraction"") that they needed rescuing before they faced starvation or hypothermia.

Although GPS devices aren't allowed in the Barkley, plenty of other gear is, including compasses, walking sticks and trail running backpacks with food and water. Many long-distance runners prefer quality, thick-soled shoes; a light but warm jacket for nights and peaks; a hydration pack; portable food; salt tablets; and a powerful headlamp for night running. Unlike other ultramarathons, this one does not have gear requirements. These runners know what they're doing.

Training in the sport also includes learning how to avoid injuries, but that's not always possible. Injuries such as cuts and sprains are typical on the Barkley, but nothing has ever halted a runner in their tracks. The worst injury was a kneecap that ""snapped in two,"" Laz said, and the runner still finished the loop. ""It's a different breed,"" he cackled.

though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. Among the 1,212 active ultrarunners in the study, injuries were also more prevalent among younger (under age 40), less-experienced runners. Most (64.6%) reported an exercise-related injury that resulted in lost training days over the previous year, but that didn't translate to additional missed days at work. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures. Ultrarunners suffer about the same frequency of injuries as shorter-distance runners, according to a recent study by the University of California, Davis and Stanford University,though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running.

That study also found that while ultrarunners tended to be older than the general running population, they had fewer incidents of heart disease and other chronic conditions. They were more likely than the general population to have allergies, hay fever and exercise-induced asthma, probably due to high levels of exposure to pollen-gifting nature. In general, running is outstanding cardio exercise, benefiting much of the body and tied to greater health outcomes than the general population.

As for the mental rewards -- well, that's a journey that is as unique as the individual and certainly not guaranteed. A ""sense of accomplishment"" is an expression that grossly undersells the thrill of finishing a race as special and difficult at the Barkley.

288,288,2018-05-09 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Washington (CNN) The first big primary night of 2018 is in the books.

It was tough going for some Republican House members looking for a promotion. But it also might cause a little heartburn for Republicans who are hoping to return to the chamber, or join it for the first time.

Based on Tuesday's results, CNN is moving four races to a more competitive ranking -- all in favor of the Democrats. In three of those contests, Republicans remain strong favorites to hold the seat, but Democrats landed candidates they feel are good fits for the districts. That also is true in the fourth race on the list, which moves to the Toss-Up column. Of the 22 races now rated as Toss-Ups, 20 are currently held by Republicans.

As a reminder, Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats in order to win control of the House.

NC-09: GOP Rep. Robert Pittenger became the first incumbent to lose a renomination contest this cycle, creating an open seat opportunity for Democrats where the party had already landed a strong challenger. Democrat Dan McCready, a Marine Corps veteran and clean energy entrepreneur, received nearly 38,000 votes Tuesday -- roughly 4,000 more than Pittenger and GOP primary winner Mark Harris combined. McCready heads into the general election with $1.2 million in the bank compared to about $70,000 for Harris, a former pastor. This district went for Donald Trump by 12 points in 2016, but Democrats hold a clear edge in enthusiasm at this stage of the race. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-Up.

289,289,2018-04-09 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Two years ago, Brendan Tyne pleaded with the Food and Drug Administration to approve a drug that he was hopeful could finally bring his mother some peace.

She could no longer move without assistance and had fallen victim to the debilitating and frightening psychosis that haunts many people with Parkinson's disease.

""She thinks there are people in the house and animals are trying to get her,"" he told an FDA advisory committee.

He believed that a new medication called Nuplazid, made by San Diego-based Acadia Pharmaceuticals, was the answer.

Nuplazid's review was being expedited because it had been designated a ""breakthrough therapy"" -- meaning that it demonstrated ""substantial improvement"" in patients with serious or life-threatening diseases compared to treatments already on the market. Congress created this designation in 2012 in an effort to speed up the FDA's approval process, which has long been criticized for being too slow. Around 200 drugs have been granted this designation since its creation.

Still, to recommend approval, the advisory committee would have to find that the drug's potential benefits outweighed its risks for its intended patients.

Some FDA officials concluded that Nuplazid's public health benefit was enough to merit approval of the drug. Their argument echoed the pleas of family members and caregivers like Tyne: It could possibly help patients with no other alternative. Several of the people who spoke said their loved ones had been transformed during the clinical trials, though some said there was no way for them to know whether they were on Nuplazid or a placebo.

But the physician who led the FDA's medical review, Dr. Paul Andreason, warned that patients taking the drug during the company's clinical trials experienced serious outcomes, including death, at more than double the rate of those taking the placebo. The company's limited testing, he said, had not convinced him that the benefits outweighed the risks.

I remember leaving really, really frustrated FDA advisory committee member

While Tyne had heard about these risks, he said he ""discounted death as a real statistical possibility"" and was willing to try anything to help his mother.

""I have two young children who love their grandmother,"" he told the committee. ""If nothing is done to bring her back to some semblance of normalcy, my children will never remember their grandmother for who she is: a loving, funny, caring woman who has improved the lives of all of the loved ones who surround her. Please, I beg you, do not deprive my children and their grandmother of experiencing that love.""

'You have to take it seriously'

The committee voted 12-2 and recommended that the FDA approve Nuplazid for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis based on a six-week study of about 200 patients . Three previous studies of the drug did not show that it was effective, Andreason said in his medical review, though they showed similar risk.

Even some committee members who voted in favor of the drug expressed reservations, according to the hearing transcript. ""I guess I'm hoping that the risks are going to be small, and I think the benefits for some of these people who are very sick and whose families are affected by this, I think they're probably willing to take that risk,"" one physician stated. Another committee member said she wouldn't have voted for the drug's approval if there had been a safe and effective alternative on the market. A third made a ""plea"" to the FDA to ""consider a large observational study so we can ensure that, once it goes into real-world use, that the benefits will outweigh the risks.""

It hit the market in June 2016. As caregivers and family members rushed to get their loved ones on it, sales climbed to roughly $125 million in 2017.

Tyne got his mother on the drug as soon as it became available. But after trying it for months, he says he was devastated to see that it was doing nothing to halt the awful progression of the disease, and her hallucinations became more frequent and harder to manage. ""She has gone straight downhill to the point she really can't function at all,"" he said.

Shortly after the drug's release, patients' family members, doctors and other health care professionals started reporting ""adverse events"" possibly linked to the medication -- including deaths, life-threatening incidents, falls, insomnia, nausea and fatigue. In more than 1,000 reports, patients continued to experience hallucinations while on Nuplazid.

Creatures like cats and snakes can haunt patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis, as shown in Acadia's TV commercial.

In November, an analysis released by a nonprofit health care organization, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, warned that 244 deaths had been reported to the FDA between the drug's launch and March 2017. The organization also noted that hundreds of reports suggested the drug was ""not providing the expected benefit"" or potentially worsening the condition.

Tracked by the FDA, these so-called ""adverse event reports"" document deaths, side effects and other issues, and can be made directly by consumers, caregivers and other medical professionals. Reports are submitted to either the FDA or to the drugmaker, which is required to pass along any it receives to the federal government. In some cases, the person filing the report is convinced the side effects were caused by the drug; in others, the reporter ascribes no cause but notes that the patient was on the drug.

An adverse event report does not mean that a suspected medication has been ruled the cause of harm and is typically not the result of an official investigation. But the FDA uses the information to monitor potential issues with a drug and can take action as needed -- updating a medication's label, for instance, or restricting its use or pulling it off the market.

After analyzing the adverse event data for Nuplazid, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices concluded that this batch of reports ""reinforces the concerns of those who warned that (Nuplazid) might do more harm than good."" Thomas Moore, senior scientist for drug safety and policy for the nonprofit, said the deaths are an ""important warning signal"" and warrant further review by the FDA -- and possible action, depending on what the review finds.

Since the institute released its analysis, FDA data shows that the number of reported deaths has risen to more than 700. As of last June, Nuplazid was the only medication listed as ""suspect"" in at least 500 of the death reports.

This is almost unheard of to have this many deaths reported...you have to take it seriously. Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research

Physicians, medical researchers and other experts told CNN that they worried that the drug had been approved too quickly, based on too little evidence that it was safe or effective. And given these mounting reports of deaths, they say that more needs to be done to assess Nuplazid's true risks.

""This is almost unheard of, to have this many deaths reported,"" said Diana Zuckerman, founder and president of the nonprofit thinktank the National Center for Health Research, adding that because reports are voluntary, potential problems may be underreported. ""You just don't see this with most new drugs -- you don't see all these reports -- so you have to take it seriously.""

Acadia and the FDA maintain that the medication's potential benefits continue to outweigh the risks and help fill a desperate need. Psychosis affects up to 50% of the roughly one million Americans suffering from Parkinson's disease, according to the FDA, and Nuplazid is the first drug to be approved to treat this specific condition.

Acadia said there are a number of reasons for the higher volume of death reports. Parkinson's disease psychosis is more commonly seen in patients in the most advanced stages of the disease, meaning they are already at a high risk of death. Plus, the company distributes Nuplazid through a network of specialty pharmacies that allow them to be in more frequent contact with both patients and caregivers -- meaning it is more likely to receive reports of death, which it is required to pass along to the FDA.

""If you are actively and regularly engaging patients and/or caregivers, it is inevitable that you will see a higher number of adverse events reported, especially in an older, chronically ill patient population,"" the company said in a statement.

It said its ""benefit/risk assessment of Nuplazid remains unchanged,"" and it carefully monitors and regularly analyzes safety reports from both ongoing studies and adverse event reports. The company noted, for example, that since the drug's approval, two studies of a total of more than 300 patients with Alzheimer's disease did not find a difference in the number of deaths reported between Nuplazid and the placebo.

The company also provided CNN with a statement from Dr. Joseph Jankovic, professor of neurology and an expert on movement disorders at Baylor College of Medicine. ""I have accumulated a great deal of experience with this drug,"" Jankovic said in the statement. ""While not all patients are completely satisfied, many of my patients have experienced marked improvement in their visual hallucinations, paranoia and other psychotic symptoms.""

In an interview this week, FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb was asked by CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta about his thoughts on drugs that receive expedited reviews and then prompt concerns about safety once they become available, like Nuplazid. While Gottlieb didn't want to comment on a specific product, he said he is ""familiar with the circumstances"" and that it's very important for the agency to make sure it is ""appropriately balancing"" safety with medical need. He said this is a flexible standard, however, and there may be more tolerance for risk in situations where there is a significant need and patients don't have an alternative.

""You've seen us take regulatory action recently in the post-market setting to limit the use of drugs when new safety concerns became known,"" he said.

The FDA told CNN it will continue to monitor the adverse event reports and review the drug's safety. It added that Nuplazid's ""complex safety profile,"" recognized at the time of its approval, resulted in a requirement that the medication carry a number of warnings on its label so that doctors could analyze potential risks and benefits before prescribing the drug.

The cases reported so far, according to the FDA, typically involved elderly patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease who suffer from numerous medical conditions and often take other medications that can increase the risk of death.

What should we investigate next? Email Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken

""Based on these data, the FDA has, at this time, not identified a specific safety issue that is not already adequately described in the product labeling,"" the agency said in a statement.

The FDA has required antipsychotics to carry its most severe ""black box"" warning for the treatment of elderly dementia patients, after studies found that the medications increase the risk of death in this population. Between 50% and 80% of Parkinson's patients experience dementia as the disease worsens, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Because Nuplazid is a new kind of antipsychotic that targets a different receptor in the brain, its maker claims it comes with fewer toxic side effects. Even so, Nuplazid also carries a black box warning.

Geriatric psychiatrist and former FDA medical officer Susan Molchan said that the number of deaths is alarming and questioned whether patients and their families are aware of the risks associated with the drug.

To determine the true risks of Nuplazid, the researchers interviewed by CNN said, the FDA needs to require further scientific studies -- and not just rely on the reports, which are challenging to interpret and are not systematically collected. They also worried that, because the drug was already approved, these studies and any action by the FDA could take years.

Hundreds of adverse event reports

A CNN review of several hundred adverse event reports shows that the detail provided for each case varies widely and that thorough investigations are rarely conducted -- making it difficult to determine whether Nuplazid might have been involved in the deaths of already sick and elderly patients.

In these reports, the physicians who prescribed the drug sometimes suggest that their patients likely died from complications from Parkinson's rather than because of Nuplazid. In other cases, it's unclear when exactly the patient started or stopped taking the medication. And in yet others, family members and sometimes doctors are convinced the drug contributed to the deaths.

This is exactly what I thought I was going to happen. Dr. Paul Andreason, who led the FDA medical review of Nuplazid

One report recounts the death of a 73-year-old woman in a long-term care facility who was taking Nuplazid. Just before 8 in the morning, a nurse noted that the woman was ""sleepy."" Shortly after, she was found unresponsive and without a pulse. Paramedics were not able to revive her and, less than an hour after the nurse's visit, she was pronounced dead. While her physician didn't believe her death was ""related"" to Nuplazid, her husband was convinced that it had played a role and paid for an autopsy. It showed only that she had pre-existing heart issues and died of cardiac arrest.

In another report, an 89-year-old man was taken off the drug after experiencing a significant decline. His doctor blamed Nuplazid for his deteriorating condition. The patient died weeks later. In a third report, a woman flagged her husband's death to the FDA after he was taken to the hospital due to dehydration. After he passed away, she said, she was told by ""someone at the hospital"" that the death was connected to his use of Nuplazid.

Acadia said it analyzed these reports and concluded that there ""is nothing to suggest a causal relationship to Nuplazid."" Acadia calculated a mortality rate for Nuplazid, which it said was lower than what you'd see in the general population of Parkinson's disease psychosis patients covered by Medicare. It calculated this using deaths reported to the FDA and what it considered a conservative estimate of patients on the drug, along with Medicare claims data. However, multiple experts interviewed by CNN said that this is an unreliable calculation since it is comparing apples to oranges.

Widening the patient pool

In the weeks after the Institute for Safe Medication Practices issued its report on the deaths, Acadia's stock price dropped by more than 20%. While many large investors remain bullish about the stock, some investment analysts have made public records requests to the FDA for the death reports.

Currently, Nuplazid can cost nearly $100 a day, according to wholesale pricing data from First Databank . That can add up to more than $30,000 a year for a single patient, though the amount a patient actually pays depends on factors including individual insurance coverage.

Acadia expects sales of Nuplazid to at least double this year.

Acadia's TV commercial shows how frightening Parkinson's disease psychosis can be.

The company, meanwhile, is forging ahead with clinical trials in an attempt to get the medication approved for use in a larger patient population: patients who have dementia-related psychosis. In October, the FDA granted its coveted breakthrough designation for this potential use as well, meaning it will also undergo a speedier review process.

While a doctor can legally prescribe a drug for any reason, insurance companies may not approve it for uses that are not FDA-approved. So FDA approval to treat dementia patients would likely result in Nuplazid being prescribed to a much wider population, concerned medical experts told CNN.

""You would certainly hope they don't approve it for anything else,"" said Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research, based on the current research and FDA adverse event reports. ""If they're going to approve it for another group of patients that is much, much larger -- that would be unconscionable.

""That is something they should absolutely not do given these unanswered questions about risk.""

'I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up'

Roughly two years have passed since that FDA meeting, where family members and caregivers -- some of whom traveled there on Acadia's dime -- gathered with medical experts to debate the merits and potential risks of Nuplazid.

Andreason, the physician who led the FDA's medical review of Nuplazid, no longer works for the agency.

He said that while he stands by the warnings he made at the time, he understands that other antipsychotics used to treat Parkinson's patients also come with an increased risk of death and that, when patients have a debilitating disease like Parkinson's, physicians and caregivers may choose a medication that improves quality of life even if it could also shorten life expectancy.

He said that he was not surprised to hear about the reports of death.

Knowing what I know now -- that it didn't work at all -- I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up. Son of Parkinson's patient

""This is exactly what I thought was going to happen,"" he said. ""We were going to get a burst of reports of serious adverse events and deaths.""

Dr. Stephanie Fox-Rawlings, a senior fellow at the National Center for Health Research who spoke against the drug's approval at the FDA committee meeting, recently told CNN she understands how desperate families in these situations are, but she does not think Nuplazid is the answer based on her review of Acadia's public research. She and Zuckerman said that, after previous studies didn't show it was effective, the drugmaker changed the way the medication's ability to improve psychosis was measured, which resulted in a positive outcome. Acadia said its studies have had different objectives and all of them have used ""consistent, appropriate, and validated assessment methodology.""

""If patients know there is some level of benefit, they can judge their risk,"" said Fox-Rawlings. ""But if we don't even know that it does work, how do you even judge that? It's kind of a false hope.""

Kim Witczak was the consumer representative on the FDA committee evaluating Nuplazid. She and the patient representative were the only two members to vote against its approval. She still can't believe it's on the market.

""I remember leaving really, really frustrated,"" she said.

CNN reached two of the three family members who petitioned for Nuplazid's approval at the meeting, despite having had no experience with the drug or its clinical trials, to ask whether they tried the medication once it hit the market.

One of these was Elaine Casavant. Despite the ""staggering cost"" of the medication, she said, she was quick to get her husband on it. But after three months, he showed no improvement and they stopped the medication. She has heard success stories, however, and remains optimistic that the drug could be helping certain people.

The other person was Tyne.

The 43-year-old New Jersey resident works in New York and visits his mother every weekend at a nursing home in the Bronx. Tyne has attempted to move on from the disappointment of Nuplazid, but he still gets frustrated talking about it.

""Knowing what I know now -- that it didn't work at all -- I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up,"" he said.

But he doesn't regret trying.

""If there was something that could possibly help my mom and I didn't do it, I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror.""

290,290,2018-06-22 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Madrid (CNN) More protests are planned Friday in Spain over a court's decision to grant bail to five men who were controversially convicted of sexual abuse of a teenage girl rather than more serious charges.

The case sparked outrage in April after the men were cleared of gang rape charges for the attack, which happened at the 2016 running of the bulls in Pamplona.

The case became known as ""la manada,"" or ""the wolf pack,"" after the name of a WhatsApp group on which the defendants and other friends chatted.

Thousands of people joined demonstrations in cities across Spain on Thursday night following the decision by the court in Northern Spain's Navarre region to release the men, who are appealing their nine-year prison sentences, on bail.

The court deemed there was no flight risk and no risk of the men committing the crime again before their appeal is heard, a statement said. The men must pay bail of 6,000 euros (about $7,000) each, give up their passports and report regularly to their local court, among other conditions.

291,291,2018-01-05 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) It's a precious moment for families around the world when twilight falls, children yawn and bedtime routines engage.

Yet the places where children sleep, the time they lay down at night and even how they prepare for shut-eye vary across cultures.

Even differences in children's bedrooms around the world can be striking, as inVenice-basedphotographer James Mollison's photo series "" Where Children Sleep ,"" which has been adapted into a book.

Though it has been nearly seven years since the series was published, the photographs still spark conversation as they turn a lens to bedtime around the globe

Parenting Without Borders considers how parenting trends and methods differ -- or don't -- around the world.

While photographing the series, ""I met many families who sleep together in one room or children who sleep in a space of convenience, rather than a place they can in any sense call their room,"" Mollison said.

""I came to appreciate just how privileged I was to have had my own bedroom to sleep in and grow,"" he said. ""I met children who had literally nothing except for a place to sleep and other children who couldn't move for all their toys.""

Here is a sampling of what bedtime looks like in households around the world.

Drastic differences in babies' bedtimes

While researching children's sleep across the globe, clinical psychologist Jodi Mindell was surprised to discover significant differences in bedtimes for infants and toddlers based on where they lived.

She described the differences as ""unbelievable.""

""When I walked into doing this study, I really thought we would see 10- or 15-minute differences,"" said Mindell, a professor at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia and associate director of the Sleep Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia

It turned out, however, ""we're seeing these 2½-hour differences between some countries like Australia and New Zealand with other countries like Hong Kong and Korea,"" she said. ""Bedtimes ranged dramatically across cultures.""

Mindell and her colleagues analyzed how the parents of 29,287 infants and toddlers, up to 3 years old, responded to questionnaires about their children's bedtimes. Those findings were published in the journal Sleep Medicine in 2010.

The parents were from China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. They completed the questionnaires between May and June 2006, September and December 2007 and April 2008.

The researchers found that the latest bedtimes were reported among parents in Hong Kong, who on average reported bedtimes about 10:17 p.m., whereas the earliest bedtimes were reported among parents in New Zealand: around 7:28 p.m., on average.

The study was sponsored by pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson, and Mindell has served as a consultant for the company.

Bedtimes also appear to vary across European countries, said Sara Harkness, a professor and director of the Center for the Study of Culture, Health, and Human Development at the University of Connecticut.

She was not involved in the Sleep Medicine study but has conducted research on children's activities and bedtimes.

""We certainly did find in our research in Spain that early bedtimes were not common for young children. In fact, on one occasion, our Spanish colleague invited us to watch preschool children in a performance at a local festival starting about 11 p.m.,"" Harkness said.

""The most dramatic contrast we've seen to this pattern is in the Netherlands, where babies and young children are put to bed at around 6:30 or 7 and expected to sleep through the night in their own bed, often in their own room,"" she said.

On the other hand, ""in small-scale traditional preindustrial societies such as the Kipsigis people of Kenya, where we did research in the 1970s, babies were always in close proximity to caretakers, generally their mother or an older sibling, and they slept anywhere and any time,"" she said.

Around the world, there are not only differences in when babies snooze but in what happens before they slumber.

Parents try it all to get babies to sleep

In the United States, it's common for parents to prepare their children for bedtime with a soothing bath followed by a lullaby or, for older kids, a book.

Yet around the world, bedtime routines involve a different approach, and in some places, they appear to be less common.

""One of the biggest similarities is that most families include in their child's bedtime routine, for 0-3, some type of feeding, whether it's breastfeeding or bottle-feeding or snacks, and that's consistent across all countries, but if we take that out, there's big differences in activities like bathing,"" Mindell said, citing her own research

In the US, ""60% of families have a bath as part of their bedtime routine. It's even higher in the United Kingdom at 81%. But somewhere like India, only 13%. In Indonesia, it's only 6%,"" she said. ""They typically bathe in the morning or at another time of the day.""

There are also regional differences in which bedtime routines include prayers, Mindell added.

""In the Philippines, 29% of families -- basically one out of three families -- include prayers as part of their bedtime routine,"" she said. ""Whereas some place like Australia, only 6% did. In Indonesia, 30% include prayers as part of their bedtime routine.""

Once the time comes to actually get some shut-eye, parents use different approaches to get their children to sleep.

In Korea, Harkness said, parents often sleep with their babies to help them drift into dreamland, but Dutch parents tend to leave their babies alone in their rooms, where the children must learn to put themselves to sleep.

""The Dutch parents in our studies strongly supported a cultural rule of the ' Three R's' of childrearing -- rust, regelmaat, en reinheid, or 'rest, regularity and cleanliness' -- which entailed establishing a firm routine featuring plenty of sleep on a regular schedule from an early age,"" Harkness said.

Who bed-shares, and who doesn't

Similar differences emerge among bed-sharing practices.

""Co-sleeping is the usual practice in preindustrial societies around the world where there are no special beds for babies to sleep safely by themselves. Co-sleeping on mats on the floor is a cultural norm in Asia, where the family traditionally co-sleeps together in the same room. Mats are brought out at night, then stored during the day so the same room is both a living room and a sleeping room,"" Harkness said.

""We found more tolerance for co-sleeping for at least part of the night for babies and young children in European communities we studied, but this may have changed more recently following pediatric advice,"" she said.

In the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against sharing a bed with your infant and says ""there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of devices promoted to make bed-sharing 'safe.' ""

""The US parents seem to receive more strict guidance, especially from pediatricians, about avoiding co-sleeping,"" Harkness said. ""This is part of a larger set of advice about sleeping arrangements, including not using padded 'bumpers' around cribs, having the baby sleep on its back and not using covers such as quilts or blankets for babies -- all for the same purpose of avoiding the danger of suffocation.""

'Bedtime routines are the perfect package'

All in all, bedtime routines can benefit a child's development , Mindell said.

""Bedtime routines are the perfect package for not only sleep, but for promoting positive child development,"" Mindell said.

""Children who have consistent bedtime routines not only sleep better, but it also promotes things like literacy, attachment, language, bonding and self-care -- all the things that we want children to have, whether or not they live in India or whether they live in the United States,"" she said.",Bedtime: How parents around the world get kids to sleep,http://cnn.com/2018/01/05/health/baby-bedtimes-parenting-without-borders-explainer-intl/index.html
292,292,2018-04-30 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Washington (CNN) While Democrats came up short in last Tuesday's Arizona special election -- losing by fewer than five points in a district Donald Trump carried by 21 points -- the results offer yet another sign the party still holds the energy edge heading into November's midterm election.

As we approach a cluttered stretch of the primary calendar, the results from those contests -- and the next wave of campaign fundraising reports in June -- will help to clarify the Democratic Party's prospects this fall.

That deadline will offer a good idea of whether Democrats can maintain momentum. More than three dozen Democratic House candidates outraised Republican incumbents for the second quarter in a row after the most recent filing.

Trump's national approval rating, meanwhile, continues to hover around 40%, which poses an additional challenge for GOP candidates running this year.

With all that in mind, we are moving a dozen Republican held House districts to a more competitive rating. Each race below is moving in the direction of the Democrats even though the Republican remains favored in all of them.

As a reminder, Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats in order to win control of the House. Of the 11 races rated Lean Democratic by CNN, seven are currently held by Republicans, as are 19 of the 21 races rated Toss-Up. Of the 25 races CNN now rates as Lean Republican, all are Republican-held -- or in the case of the Ohio 12th District seat vacated by Pat Tiberi, had been held by a Republican.

AZ-06: You might not have to look very far for reverberations from last week's special election results. The neighboring 6th District, represented by GOP Rep. Dave Schweikert, is more favorable terrain for Democrats than the 8th District -- more suburban and home to a higher percentage of college graduates. Trump won here by 10 points, a much slimmer margin than Mitt Romney's 21-point spread in 2012. Arizona has a late primary at the end of August, but Democrats believe Arizona State University nursing professor Heather Ross has the potential to make this race more competitive if she emerges as the nominee. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

AR-02: Arkansas state Rep. Clarke Tucker gives Democrats a candidate who could make inroads in the 2nd District, home to Little Rock. Tucker announced his bid in early February, and despite the late start managed to beat GOP Rep. French Hill in fundraising by about $130,000 in the first quarter. Trump won the district by 10 points, slipping from Romney's 12-point margin four years earlier. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

CA-04: There are some shared qualities with the northern Sacramento suburbs of California's 4th District and the Phoenix suburbs from Arizona's 8th District. Both have a large contingent of senior citizens. They also have a similar racial breakdown. Trump won only 53% in this district, falling off five points from Romney's 58% mark in 2012. Veteran GOP Rep. Tom McClintock has been outraised by leading Democratic candidate Jessica Morse in three consecutive fundraising quarters. Morse also has a $715,000 to $676,000 cash on hand lead. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

FL-16: GOP Rep. Vern Buchanan has won comfortably the last two cycles, and while he remains a heavy favorite he'll have to work a bit to earn a seventh term in this Sarasota-area district. He's sitting on $2.5 million in the bank and raised $480,000 in the first quarter. He'll likely face Sarasota attorney David Shapiro in November. The Democrat raised $400,000 in the first quarter and is just shy of half a million cash on hand. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

IL-14: Lauren Underwood, a registered nurse and former Department of Health and Human Services adviser in the Obama administration, scored 57% of the vote in a crowded Democratic primary last month. Democrats are hopeful she can give GOP Rep. Randy Hultgren a serious challenge in the 14th District, which is made up of Chicago exurbs. Hultgren has benefited from weakly-funded challengers in previous cycles -- a luxury he likely won't have against Underwood, who raised $465,000 in the first quarter. Hultgren brought in $360,000 -- but still has a significant cash on hand advantage ($783,000 vs. $235,000). While Trump won this district by four points in 2016, Barack Obama carried it with 50% in 2008. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

MI-01: This northern Michigan district, which includes the Upper Peninsula, went for Trump by 22 points, but gave Romney and McCain single-digit victories. The race is shaping up to be a contest between two Marine Corps veterans -- incumbent GOP Rep. Jack Bergman and Democratic candidate Matthew Morgan. Morgan has outraised Bergman in each of the past two quarters and now holds a $317,000 to $307,000 advantage in terms of cash on hand. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

NJ-03: GOP Rep. Tom MacArthur's support for Trump's agenda (health care repeal and tax cuts) and a strong challenge from likely Democratic nominee Andy Kim make this swing district competitive. The district went for Trump by six points, but backed Barack Obama by four in 2012. Kim, a former national security adviser to Obama, outraised MacArthur by more than $200,000 in the first quarter, though the Republican still holds an advantage of roughly $270,000 in cash on hand. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

NM-02: Both parties are facing primary fights in the 2nd District, which opened up when GOP Rep. Steve Pearce decided to run for governor in the Land of Enchantment. On the Republican side, it appears to be a contest between state Rep. Yvette Herrell and former Hobbs Mayor Monty Newman. Xochitl Torres Small looks to the the frontrunner for the Democratic nod. The attorney and former field representative for Sen. Tom Udall raised $313,000 in the first quarter, beating Newman and Herrell combined. While registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in this district, Trump carried it by 10 points, which was a wider margin than Romney's seven-point win in 2012. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

OH-01: All eyes in Ohio are on the 12th District special election in August, but the House race in the Buckeye State to watch in November is likely to be the 1st District, where GOP Rep. Steve Chabot could face a serious challenge from Democrat Aftab Pureval. Pureval, the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts, outraised Chabot by nearly half a million dollars in the first quarter of 2018. This district, which includes the western and northern parts of the Cincinnati metro area, went for Trump by seven points and Romney by six points. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

OH-07: Speaking of Ohio, GOP Rep. Bob Gibbs improved a bit on his lackluster $86,000 fundraising quarter at the end of 2017 -- raising $113,000 in the first quarter of 2018. Democrat Ken Harbaugh, a former Navy pilot, hauled in $441,000 -- after raising $272,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gibbs still has $1.3 million in the bank compared to Harbaugh's $726,000. The Gibbs campaign and Ohio Republicans have been attacking Harbaugh's primary opponent, Patrick Pikus, who is little known and has only raised $5,000 for his campaign -- perhaps in an attempt to raise his name ID. Democrats see the move as an indication the Gibbs campaign views Harbaugh as a threat. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

WA-05: Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the House GOP leadership, has a tough race on her hands against Democrat Lisa Brown, the former chancellor of Washington State University Spokane. A recent Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the House GOP leadership, has a tough race on her hands against Democrat Lisa Brown, the former chancellor of Washington State University Spokane. A recent poll of the district showed McMorris Rodgers leading Brown by six points, 44% to 38%, with 16% undecided. McMorris Rodgers hauled in $776,000 in the first quarter compared to $649,000 for Brown -- and the Republican leads in cash on hand by more than $700,000. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

WI-06: Even with House Speaker Paul Ryan's retirement, a lot of attention in the Badger State will be paid to the 1st District race. But the contest in the 6th District could be the best pickup opportunity in the state for Democrats, with Dan Kohl -- nephew of former Sen. Herb Kohl -- giving the party a serious challenger to GOP Rep. Glenn Grothman. Kohl has outraised Grothman now in three consecutive quarters and has $136,000 more in the bank to start April. This is another district where Trump outperformed previous Republican candidates, winning by 17 points. Romney won it by seven in 2012 while Obama carried the district in 2008. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

294,294,2018-06-21 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Touring Singaporean shipyards one day, visiting Chinese agricultural exhibitions and traffic control centers the next, Kim Jong Un's engagement with the region has had a decidedly economic air of late.

The North Korean dictator returned to Pyongyang late Wednesday after his third visit with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two discussed Kim's meeting with US President Donald Trump, but also focused on how North Korea can move forward economically now too. That is as much a priority for China, its greatest ally, as it is for North Korea.

Since the historic June 12 meeting with Trump, Kim and the North Korean regime have worked to shift the focus from nuclear brinksmanship onto the economy, something that is surprisingly evident, even in the information it has chosen to disseminate to its own people.

In a propaganda video on Kim's summit with Trump shown on North Korean state TV, a surprising amount of time was given to lauding the city-state of Singapore.

In the more than one-hour-long film that documented Kim's movements from the tarmac at Pyongyang airport onto an Air China flight, to descending a red carpeted stairway to meet Singaporean officials, the film paid as much attention to the bright lights of the modern city as it did to where Kim went, who he met, and how many hands he shook.

The decision to showcase Singapore -- an overtly prosperous industrialized nation -- may seem strange given North Korea's strident denouncement of capitalism.

But Kim's recent embrace of the West suggests he's becoming increasingly pragmatic about his country's future.

The young leader has made no secret of his determination to lift his country out of crushing poverty.

After years of isolation Kim is now using nuclear leverage to seek entry into the international community, and in doing so is exploring avenues for the country that might lead to economic growth.

The economy has been a repeated theme in Kim Jong Un's ""New Year"" speeches, too.

In his most recent, Kim Jong Un praised North Koreans' heroism for enduring the sanctions. Despite the ""difficult blockade,"" they have ""firmly trusted, absolutely supported and dynamically implemented our Party's line of simultaneously promoting the two fronts,"" Kim said.

Those two fronts refer to Kim's twofold strategy of investing in the economy and the nuclear program.

North Korea leader Kim Jong Un, center, is escorted by his security delegation as he visits Marina Bay in Singapore, Monday, June 11, 2018.

The Singapore template

In many ways, Singapore is an ideal economic model for Kim.

After it broke from the Malaysian Federation in 1965, Singapore, struggling financially and politically, embarked on massive social and economic reforms, all the while ruled with a strict hand by leader Lee Kuan Yew and his People's Action Party.

""When Kim got to Singapore he would have to think about his own country, and while Kim was able to buy himself ninth place in the nuclear weapons stakes, he's looking for a way to transition his own society,"" said Joseph Siracusa, professor of human security and international diplomacy at RMIT University in Australia.

""One of the things he would have learned is that the founder ran a tough place, was an authoritarian. Kim saw that Lee Kuan Yew sought public order above all else. He also never took foreign aid, he took foreign investment, and that is something that would weigh very heavily on this guy,"" Siracusa told CNN.

Kim surprised Singaporeans and tourists when, on the eve before his meeting with Trump, he took a tour around the city, something the North Korean propaganda film spent much time showing.

He visited the Great Flower Garden, North Korean news anchor Ri Chun Hee gushed to viewers. She noted that the garden was ""made by reclaiming tide lands around Marina Bay, and mainly carries plants that do not grow in Singapore.""

The ""Dear Supreme Leader enjoyed a nocturnal bird's-eye view of the city"" from the observation deck of the famous Marina Bay Sands, a hotel and entertainment mecca with an infinity pool , lookout point, and the Ce La Vi bar and restaurant on the rooftop.

Wherever he went, Kim received a rapturous reception. People crowded streets and sidewalks to cheer him, snap his picture, and wave wildly at the North Korean autocrat.

He also visited Singapore's port, which the news anchor informed viewers was known as the world's busiest. ""As the supreme leader looked around the port, he said that he could get to know well the potentials and development of Singapore's economy through that day's tour, adding that he came to have a good impression of the country,"" she said.

That good impression would likely have carried back to Pyongyang said Siracusa.

""Kim would have been very struck looking very closely at a place that he knows has gone from a backwater to this First World landscape, and asked himself how it did this,"" Siracusa told CNN.

""When he says he's in a science fiction movie with Donald Trump , he's looking at his future, he wants a place like that to attract people, he's thinking about foreign money coming in. He really thinks North Korea could be a tourist destination.""

Kim's economic options

It was only last month that, shortly after North Korea detonated buildings and tunnel entrances at the Punggye-ri test site in the province of Wonsan, Kim Jong Un inspected development at a nearby tourist zone that he hopes will attract foreign investment.

His lifeline for dollars coming in from the outside have largely been through China, which maintains a border crossing with the isolated regime in the city of Dandong, which is separated from North Korea by the Yalu River.

Sanctions have squeezed the Chinese city, and the trucks that once sped along the highway with regular frequency now rarely make the journey across the border.

But even as the Trump administration touts North Korea's readiness to denuclearize in exchange for sanctions relief, there's little evidence to suggest the ""soft authoritarianism"" exercised in Singapore would be the model Kim Jong Un would necessarily subscribe to, says Andrew O'Neil, dean of research at the Griffith Business School in Australia.

A conductor reads the latest edition of the Rodong Sinmun newspaper showing images of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meeting with US president Donald Trump during their summit in Singapore, at a news stand on a subway platform of the Pyongyang metro on June 13, 2018.

""While the economic achievements of Singapore are extraordinary, they have been based largely on state-led capitalist development modeled on South Korea and Taiwan, coupled with Singapore's geographical location as a key entry point into a region that has experienced the world's fastest levels of economic growth,"" O'Neil told CNN.

""North Korea's situation is very different, and economically, in relative terms, is more comparable to the situation South Korea was in during the early to mid-1960s,"" he said.

Whither the Chinese yuan

Whatever kind of quick rapport Kim might have struck with Donald Trump, he was back in Beijing a week after their historic encounter to debrief his steadiest benefactor and champion, Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Xi said that ""Kim's third visit in less than 100 days has ushered in a new chapter in high-level bilateral exchanges.""

Adding that he is ""looking forward to seeing a peaceful, stable, developing and prosperous peninsula and North Asia thanks to the joint efforts of all sides.""

Kim, meanwhile, noted that ""bilateral ties are as close and friendly as family"" and that he would ""play his due role in preserving peace and stability in the region.""

People bicycle past a giant TV screen broadcasting the meeting of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Chinese President Xi Jinping during a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Tuesday, June 19, 2018.

The Chinese government has sounded positive notes about the June 12 meeting and wants North Korea's sanctions relief to begin soon.

""China always holds the view that sanctions are not the goal,"" China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters after the summit. ""

Actions by the UN Security Council should support and coordinate with the current diplomatic dialogues and efforts on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and the promotion of a political settlement on the peninsula issue,"" he said.

During his recent visit to Beijing, Kim joined Xi in touring numerous showcase development facilities, including the Beijing Municipal Track Traffic Control Center and State Agricultural Sci-tech Innovation Institute.

""To be honest, the Chinese have been trying to engage successive North Korean leaders in the idea of embracing Chinese market reforms, taking growth triangles seriously, and opening up key sectors of the North Korean economy to little avail,"" said O'Neil.

""It might just be that the towering skyscrapers and bustle of Singapore had a big impact on Kim Jong Un last week, but whether it impels serious economic reform at home, much less political movement from totalitarianism to authoritarianism, is something I'm dubious about.""

Normalization, or maybe not yet

For some observers, the most likely example Kim could follow is that of Vietnam, a Communist nation that went from being an American enemy to a partner in trade and security.

reform program adopted in the mid-1980s promoted a ""socialist-orientated market economy,"" similar to China's, with a five-year plan that pushed for a 70% increase in exports.

It was followed in the early 1990s by normalization of relations between the US and Vietnam, and the entry of American investors and the opening of a US embassy in Hanoi.

In the heady days that followed Kim's first meeting at the demilitarized zone with South Korean President Moon Jae-in this April, the two discussed the creation of economic zones and re-opening a railway line between the two Koreas that would stretch into China and the rest of the continent.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (C) walks on the Jubilee bridge during a tour in Singapore on June 11, 2018.

There, Moon gave Kim a USB stick that detailed three proposed ""development belts"" covering energy and natural resources; transportation, logistics and industry; and environment and tourism.

North Korea has plenty of promising prospects and many willing partners. The Center for Strategic and International Studies said the strategy employed by the US administration was a ""Mini-Marshall Plan, prepared and executed in coordination with US allied partners Japan and South Korea, to assist North Korea in developing a self-sustaining economy.""

""This will include help in modernization of the power grid in North Korea, expansion of the mining and minerals industry leading to major sources of income from mineral exports, and revitalization of the agricultural sector, with the goal of becoming self-sufficient in food production,"" the report said.

Beyond the proposals there is still the question of what Kim will do, and there are enough skeptics who say he will continue to hold the world at ransom for his nuclear arsenal in return for economic concessions.

""My sense is the intent of the (propaganda) video was to illustrate the international legitimacy of Kim Jong Un and to 'show him off' to his people,"" says David Maxwell, a retired US Army Special Forces colonel and a fellow at the Institute of Korean American Studies.

""I think it was aimed at domestic political legitimacy. No matter how rich a country is, it has great respect for Kim Jong Un. A message might be that the sacrifice of the Korean people in the North to ensure the success of the revolution in the face of a hostile US and international community has been justified, because they have provided the foundation for Kim Jong Un's strength and stature in the international community while defending against a nuclear armed South Korea/US alliance.""",Kim Jong Un looks to the East for economic inspiration,http://cnn.com/2018/06/21/asia/kim-singapore-economic-model-intl/index.html

Harry Kane scores hat-trick

England qualifies for last 16, Panama eliminated

(CNN) England qualified for the last 16 of the World Cup with a thumping 6-1 victory over Panama Sunday in a sweltering Nizhny Novgorod.

Harry Kane scored a hat-trick, John Stones grabbed a brace while Jesse Lingard also got his name on the score sheet as England dismantled its Central American opponents.

The result means Panama exits its debut World Cup at the group stage with one match still to play -- although there was the considerable consolation of a first ever goal at the tournament, that honor falling to 37-year-old defender Felipe Baloy.

For England, it was the first time it had scored four or more goals in a World Cup game since the victorious 1966 final against West Germany.

Gareth Southgate's side will now go toe-to-toe with Belgium to see who tops Group G on Thursday.

296,296,2018-06-19 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) The science is clear: Drinking too much alcohol is bad for your health, but exactly how low-risk is light drinking?

A study published in the journal PLOS Medicine on Tuesday provides some new insight. It found that those who drink the most have the highest risks of death and cancer.

Yet the study also found that a person's combined risk of dying younger or developing cancer is lowest among light drinkers: those consuming only one to three alcoholic drinks per week. That risk increases with each additional drink consumed per week.

Light drinkers appeared to have a lower combined risk of overall mortality or cancer compared with those who never drink, the study found, but more research is needed to determine why.

The study only showed associations between alcohol and such risks, and not any causal relationships.

""We had expected light drinkers to be at a similar combined risk to never drinkers, so the reduced risk in light drinkers was surprising,"" said Andrew Kunzmann, a research fellow at Queen's University Belfast in Northern Ireland and lead author of the study.

""The reasons for the reduced risk in light drinkers compared to never drinkers are still open to debate amongst the scientific community. Some have suggested that alcohol may have cardio-protective effects that may reduce risk of cardiovascular disease,"" Kunzmann said, referring to certain studies on red wine and heart health

Yet ""others have indicated that light drinkers may be at a lower risk of cardiovascular disease for other reasons, as light drinkers tend to be wealthier and more health-conscious in other ways,"" he said.

Those who never drink also might do so for other health reasons that could put them at an overall higher risk of death compared with light drinkers.

In general, a better understanding of the health risks that come with drinking alcohol can help inform clearer guidelines on how much you should limit your alcohol consumption, the researchers wrote in their study.

The difference in cancer, mortality risk

The new study included data on 99,654 adults in the United States, who were 55 to 74 years old. The data, collected between 1993 and 2001, came from the US Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial

The adults completed a diet history questionnaire, which assessed their alcohol consumption. They also were followed up with during an average 8.9 years, and their cancer diagnoses were ascertained through medical records.

After analyzing the data, the researchers found that the average lifetime alcohol intake reported among the adults was 1.78 drinks per week, with men reporting that they drink more -- 4.02 drinks per week -- than women -- 0.80 drinks per week.

In both the men and women, risk of death was lowest among those who consumed less than 0.5 drinks per day, the data showed. How much alcohol was consumed over a lifetime had a J-shaped relationship with overall mortality: Those who never drank had a slightly higher risk, and those who had more than 0.5 drinks per day had a much higher risk.

But the average amount of alcohol someone drank in a lifetime was linearly associated with total risk of cancer, in that risk went up the more someone drank, the data showed.

The study had some limitations, including that the data were limited to adults 55 and older, and the data on alcohol consumption were based on self-reported questionnaire responses, which tends to be the case for epidemiology studies of alcohol.

The study could have been more valuable if it provided specific risk factors for individual cancers, said Dr. Anne McTiernan, a cancer prevention researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who was not involved in the research.

For instance, ""alcohol increases risks for many cancers including, breast, colorectal, esophagus, liver, head and neck, and stomach,"" said McTiernan, author of the book ""Starved: A Nutrition Doctor's Journey from Empty to Full.""

""Equally problematic was that they classified men and women the same in relation to categories of alcohol use. Women metabolize alcohol differently than men, so a 'light' drinker for men may be more of a 'moderate' drinker for women,"" she said.

""The study strengths included the large sample size, including both women and men, and a lifetime history of alcohol use,"" she said.

'The more you drink, the higher the risk'

In the United States, the American Cancer Society and the American Institute for Cancer Research both recommend that adults who drink alcohol limit their intake to no more than two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women.

""drink"" can be counted as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of hard liquor.

The study added information on specific risk estimates according to lifetime consumption of alcohol, said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical and scientific officer and executive vice president of the American Cancer Society , who was not involved in the research.

""It also reinforces the linear relationship between drinking alcohol and cancer risk: The more you drink, the higher the risk,"" Brawley said.

""Alcohol is estimated to be the third-largest modifiable risk factor for cancer, responsible for 5.6% of cancers ,"" he said.

""Alcohol is also estimated to be the third-largest contributor to overall cancer deaths in both men and women,"" he added. ""The evidence that alcohol increases the risk of cancer has existed for many years.""

statement from the American Society of Clinical Oncology , published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in January, endorsed certain public health strategies in an effort to minimize excessive alcohol exposure in a way that could boost cancer prevention efforts.

""The purposes of that statement was twofold. One was to just raise awareness about the link between alcohol and cancer,"" said Dr. Noelle LoConte, an oncologist and associate professor of medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was lead author of that statement.

The second was that the statement supported certain policy strategies for the first time, such as ""raising taxes, limiting hours of sale, reducing youth exposure to alcohol marketing as a way of reducing high-risk drinking,"" said LoConte, who was not involved in the new PLOS Medicine study.

297,297,2018-06-24 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Auckland, New Zealand (CNN) New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and her partner Clarke Gayford have revealed the name of their baby girl, who was born Thursday.

Ardern is the first world leader in nearly 30 years to have a child while in office.

Emerging from Auckland City Hospital with their sleeping baby Sunday morning local time (Saturday evening ET), Ardern and Gayford told waiting media they had named her Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford.

This morning PM @jacindaardern and @NZClarke introduced their new baby Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford to the world, and @claire_ef got some lovely photos of the occasion. FULL GALLERY HERE: https://t.co/8nZuAc4o3I pic.twitter.com/AKA9uOg5DL

""Neve"" (pronounced like leave) means radiant, light or snow and ""Te Aroha"" (TAY AH-row-ha ) means love and is also the name of the mountain and town near where Ardern lived as a child.

The baby will be known as Neve Gayford for short.

Ardern said like many parents she and Gayford had struggled to settle on a name before the birth and had a shortlist prepared.

""We wanted to wait until the baby arrived to really see which one felt like it worked, we chose Neve because we just liked it and when we met her we thought she looked she suited the name,"" the Prime Minister said. ""Also, it means -- in various forms -- it means bright and radiant, and snow which seemed like a good combination for Matariki (the Maori New Year) and for solstice.""

However the couple chose ""Te Aroha"" quite quickly, as it reflected the love their baby had been shown before her birth, she said.

""All of the names that were gifted along the way, I thought how do I reflect the generosity, particularly from all the iwi (Maori tribes) who gifted us names and Te Aroha seemed to me to be a way we could show that love and generosity,"" Ardern explained.

""It's also the place where all my family are from as well as a place name and I grew up under that mountain.""

Ardern said the family was doing well -- but, as is common with new parents the world over, were sleep-deprived.

Gayford said he would never forget the look on Ardern's face when she held their baby.

""She looked absolutely stunned and just very, very happy.""

Gender equality

Ardern is taking six weeks parental leave before Gayford -- who hosts a fishing documentary series -- takes on the role of stay-at-home dad.

Addressing media Sunday, Ardern acknowledged the situation was viewed as somewhat novel but that she hoped one day it would be generally accepted that men and women could make such choices.

""Clark's been as much of a role model here as I am and that's been something that I've heard a lot of people talk about, too -- and it's true.

""So I hope for little girls and boys that there's a future where they can make choices about how they raise their family and what kind of career they have, that are just based on what they want and what makes them happy,"" she said.

Ardern also posted a video on her Facebook account Sunday, thanking hospital staff and well-wishers, showing her room in the maternity ward and introducing Neve.

She also got in a dig at Gayford for his thrift-shop ""Dad cardie,"" saying it had ""just been waiting for this moment."" Gayford sported the cardigan during their official press conference.

Mac 'n cheese

Ardern announced Neve's birth on her official Instagram account Thursday, saying the baby arrived at 4.45 pm local time, weighing 3.31 kilograms (7.3 pounds).

""Thank you so much for your best wishes and your kindness. We're all doing really well thanks to the wonderful team at Auckland City Hospital,"" she said in her post.

A later post thanked her midwife for providing her with a meal of macaroni and cheese.

Ardern became her party's youngest leader and New Zealand's youngest in 150 years after defeating former Prime Minister Bill English in last October's election. It marked the first victory for the Labour Party in nine years. She led the group for three months before being elected Prime Minister.

Hepatitis A is a viral infection of the liver that is commonly spread when people eat or drink something contaminated with fecal matter. The infection is usually mild and resolves within a few weeks but can be more serious, particularly in older adults or those with chronic liver disease, according to the Mayo Clinic

""This is a rare and tragic case and I offer my sincere condolences to the woman's family,"" South Australia Chief Medical Officer Paddy Phillips said in a news release

""The majority of people infected with hepatitis A recover fully and the woman's death is the only death linked to this recalled product nationally to date,"" he added.

The death comes two months after an initial recall of 180-gram bags of Creative Gourmet frozen pomegranate seeds by health officials in Australia. A reminder was issued May 8, warning people that the product was linked to an outbreak of hepatitis A in New South Wales.

There have been at least 24 cases of hepatitis A in Australia linked to the pomegranate seeds, according to the statement.

""While we expect most people would have disposed of the recalled product, we urge everyone to double-check freezers and remove any affected products,"" Phillips said.

Officials do not expect to see more cases linked to the pomegranate seeds, according to Phillips.

""The incubation period for hepatitis A is generally 15-50 days, so we don't anticipate further cases because the product was recalled two months ago,"" he said.

Creative Gourmet is an Australia-based company that distributes frozen fruits to restaurants and supermarkets across Australia. The implicated seeds come from pomegranates grown in Egypt, according to the company's website

Symptoms of hepatitis A include nausea, vomiting, fever, yellowing of the skin, dark urine and pale stool. Signs of infection can take 15 to 50 days to develop, according to the Mayo Clinic

In Australia, there are normally 300 to 500 cases of hepatitis A reported every year. Less than 1% typically result in death, according to Australia's Department of Health

There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A, as the illness normally resolves on its own. Vaccinations are available in some countries, including Australia, and are recommended for people traveling to endemic areas, child day care and preschool personnel, health care workers, sewage workers, injection drug users and patients with chronic liver disease, according to the organization Hepatitis Australia

Mike Colter remains the epitome of cool as Harlem's hero, rendered invulnerable as the byproduct of a prison experiment. In his latest 13-episode story, he must grapple with a multitude of villains, including the ruthless Mariah (a part Alfre Woodard sinks her teeth into and chews on), her accomplice Shades (Theo Rossi), and a new player known as Bushmaster (Mustafa Shakir), a bad guy plucked from the comics who's almost as indestructible as Luke.

For all that, the season does a whole lot of meandering, yielding long stretches that are not just talky but almost flabby, focusing too much on the jockeying for position and shifting alliances among the bad guys, who aren't consistently interesting enough to warrant all that attention.

As for Luke, his personal issues include his relationship with Claire (Rosario Dawson), who understandably worries about him constantly being in harm's way. ""Nothing can hurt me,"" he assures her early on, a bit of cockiness that of course will be challenged.

Still, where the first season of ""Luke Cage"" was among the best of Marvel's efforts on behalf of Netflix -- and a breakthrough for African-American superheroes before ""Black Panther"" rocked the box office -- this latest go-round lands more in the middle of the pack.

(CNN) Southern Colorado is home to some of the most stunning landscapes in the country. Where the steep, dark-green slopes of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains hit the valley floor, they are met by towering sand dunes that sprawl across more than 30 square miles. The highest dunes rise more than 700 feet into the air -- about the height of the tallest skyscraper in many American cities. This landscape has been crafted over tens of thousands of years, as winds blowing over the mountains dropped grains of sand, which slowly morphed into the dunes we see today.

Over Memorial Day weekend, I went camping in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and hiking in Great Sand Dunes National Park. I've traveled a lot and spent a lot of time in different wilderness areas, but I have to say -- this was unlike anything I had ever seen before.

Alana Miller

First recognized and protected by President Herbert Hoover in 1932, the Great Sand Dunes contain the largest dunes in North America. Every year, around 320,000 visitors , many of them children and families, enjoy the park by sandboarding down the dunes, playing in the adjacent creek, hiking or looking for wildlife. According to the park's website , the dunes are home to six species of insects that can be found nowhere else on earth, including the pretty, and appropriately named, Great Sand Dunes Tiger Beetle.

But the area around the Great Sand Dunes -- like many other special places across America -- is now at risk.

The Trump administration has proposed selling mineral rights on properties adjacent to this magnificent place, opening up the area for oil and gas drilling. According to the Denver Post , drilling could be done on land that touches the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness area and within one mile of the Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve.

While serving diplomatic and operational assignments with the FBI in over 20 countries, I saw the power of that brand up close.

When I spoke, people listened. Not because I was an inordinately gifted orator, but rather because I was speaking on behalf of the United States government, an imperfect but often emulated conglomeration of agencies known throughout the world as reflecting righteousness, fairness, and truth. As my former boss, FBI Director James Comey, would explain to fellow employees, an agency's strong reputation garners immediate trust, even from total strangers.

The benefits derived from such a powerful national brand were not limited to law enforcement, but extended to an array of colleagues I worked alongside in the foreign service, CIA, and military. As one American ambassador in South Asia described it to me, we are effective in every corner of the globe because of the moral authority generated at home by the manner in which we govern ourselves and our commitment to the rule of law.

It is this moral authority that is currently threatened by elected officials who continue to steamroll norms associated with equal justice. Shrewd calculations focused on short-term political survival and misguided notions of what constitutes ""strength"" appear to outweigh any consideration of how political actions domestically might be perceived abroad.

307,307,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Families are thrust into confusing worlds of long-term hospitalizations and treatment plans. There are increasing responsibilities to juggle, such as addressing a sick child's concerns, considering the possibility of sibling donors in stem cell transplants and mounting medical bills.

The 25 years that psychologist Joanna Breyer spent working with children who have cancer and their families at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital Boston inspired her to write ""When Your Child Is Sick: A Guide to Navigating the Practical and Emotional Challenges of Caring for a Child Who Is Very Ill.""

Breyer's book breaks down what parents need to know when their child is starting treatment or transitioning to survivorship, or if a child's treatment unfortunately does not work. Along the way, she offers strategies families can use to cope with the emotional toll of having a sick loved one and online resources to limit the logistical and financial challenges.

""When Your Child Is Sick"" shares personal stories from a few of the families Breyer encountered throughout her career, as well as poems, essays and drawings created by former patients and their siblings.

CNN recently spoke to Breyer -- whose husband, Stephen, is a US Supreme Court justice -- from her home in Washington about her book. The following is an edited transcript.

CNN: How would you describe ""When Your Child Is Sick""?

Breyer: It's a book for parents who have a sick child -- and a pretty sick child. (This is) the group that I worked with, children with cancer and their families, for many years. And I wanted the book to be for parents who were going through this awful situation. I wanted the book to be easy for parents to use, and so I wanted them to pick and choose what they read in terms of whether their child was on treatment, whether their child got through the treatment and was in a different stage, and the sort of getting on with their life. And then the final section is for the few unlucky parents whose child is not cured by the treatment they received and is going to slowly, awkwardly die. I don't think many parents who are not in that situation will read that section.

I suppose it's trying to reflect what I learned over many years of working with children and parents, and the wonderful families who I've learned so much from over the years and wanting to pass some of that on to families in the future, as well as to honor the families whom I've worked with.

CNN: You spend some time at the beginning of the book explaining all the different members in a child's treatment team and questions to bring up with them. How do parents typically feel walking into a situation like that?

Breyer: My thought is, usually, they would feel very overwhelmed and scared because it is new, and quite often, if a child is brought into an emergency room, sometimes -- obviously if it's from an accident or something, they do know why they're there -- but it may be from an unexplained symptom. And so the first week or so may be spent trying to figure out what's going on with the child, and that is particularly scary, because you just don't know what's happening for the poor parent.

CNN: Your book is ""a guide to navigating the practical and emotional challenges of caring for a child who is very ill."" What are some of those challenges?

Breyer: A practical challenge is very often how expensive this is, that having a child in the hospital, as well as having a big emotional toll, has a big financial toll. The parent will miss work, has to figure out how his or her other children are taken care of, have to do co-payments. It's very expensive.

You have to figure out how to get help for that. It becomes sometimes quite a major issue. Other challenges are how to negotiate a different world. The medical world is a different world. A parent is used to being in charge in their own home. When they come into a hospital, they sort of move into the way that the hospital does things, and that may or not coincide well with how they do things. In addition to the fear of dealing with a sick child and not knowing what the reason for it is.

They're also trying to deal with what's happening with their other children. If they're having to focus their attention on the child who's ill in the hospital, they're probably worrying about their other children, and their other children are certainly worrying about them. The role of siblings is a very difficult one in this situation. And often, not surprisingly, most understandably, because the sick child is the parents' priority at that moment. The other children feel confused, ignored, and it's difficult for them to figure out what's happening.

CNN: Like you mention in the book, adolescence is already a time of major upheaval. How should parents handle managing a teen with a chronic illness versus a younger child?

Breyer: All of the things that are normally happening in adolescence are sort of going backwards for a while. I mean, normally greater independence, greater reliance and spending time with friends, less with parents -- all of that is reversed.

When a teenager becomes sick, it's very, very difficult. It's difficult for both sides because, of course, the parents feel more protective of the adolescent who's suddenly become sick, and the adolescent needs to rely more on his parents physically and emotionally, as well.

Interestingly enough, there are some friends who probably in adolescence will find are much more able to deal with them being sick than others. Some may be scared by it, and some may, in a way, come out of the woodwork and be very comfortable being helpful and available and filling in somebody who isn't there all the time.

It's how to keep some of the things going that they were relying on but accepting that, perhaps, for a time anyway, they need to go back to being more reliant on their parents.

CNN: What are some of the different ways families can handle the stress and fear that come with having a relative with a chronic illness?

Breyer: In a way, the closer they are to it, the easier it may be because they see each day. Say it's a parent and their child, (the parent sees) what the child or the adolescent is capable of doing and what they cannot do and what at the moment they seem to be upset by, what they can tolerate and what they can't.

Let's go next to brothers and sisters. If they can feel involved in what's going on, and that means they can stay in contact with their brother or sister in the hospital, and the internet, which may be challenging to some of us, can be very helpful in that regard. And it makes it very easy to Skype or to have contact. It may be difficult for them to understand that sometimes their brother doesn't feel like talking or doesn't feel like being in contact. And there, maybe the parents need to be the intermediaries who explain that sometimes the child who's sick won't feel like talking or won't feel like being in contact. But that's nothing to do with them.

Further away, take grandparents who maybe don't live in the same city but who are frantic about what's going on. ... I do list in the book -- there are resources that are ways to organize giving meals, ways to organize getting information out. That is a root to which the widened network can be told what would be needed at this moment and what's likely to be helpful.

CNN: How do families adjust to life after a successful treatment after spending so much time in a hospital?

Breyer: It completely varies. It depends: What are the ongoing consequences of whatever the condition was? To what extent does it still have a daily impact on the functioning of a particular child and therefore indirectly on the functioning of the family? It depends how it's incorporated into the family's life. It depends on the outside circumstances that the family is facing. Are other stresses going on in their lives? Do they have a lot of support? Do they have adequate resources? As well also on the individual characters of the child and the parent. Some people are pessimists; some people are optimists. Some people are prone to anxiety; others are not.

I think one of the things I try to do in this book is try to be clear that there are not either cookie-cutter solutions or cookie-cutter outcomes because it so much depends on variables that, some of which are in our control, and others of which are not.

I think many families go back to some extent -- with those limitations -- if other things are going reasonably OK, including the child's condition, then everything goes back relatively to normal. But for most families, it's made a pretty big impact on them and may well continue to. Different things may trigger a memory or a fear about it, but obviously, the chance that things will go back to being more normal and the siblings who may have been saintlike during the time that the child has actually been ill maybe suddenly realize they're not quite such saints and maybe they have a little more space to create a little more trouble. The family goes on and slowly reacts to what they've been through in different forms and continues. Fingers crossed that things will go on remaining stable.

CNN: Like you say in your book, there are many ways to grieve. How do you recommend parents and families grieve the loss of a child if they do it differently?

Breyer: I do try to stay away from recommendations. But if I would have one hope for parents who have very different styles of grieving, it's that they're able to recognize that that is what's going on and that they don't blame the other for the way that they are behaving. It's not a recommendation, but it is a hope.

Or that somebody might point that out to them. What I would hope does not happen is that one parent takes out on the other parent the fact that they are grieving and behaving in a very different way from them. It doesn't mean that they're not sad, and it doesn't mean that they're not devastated. It just means that they are dealing with this in a different way. So I suppose if I could get a message across, that's the one I would hope to get across: Not that any one style is right or wrong, because I don't think that's true. But it's just that there are terribly different ways of reacting to something as awful as this.

CNN: What is the biggest takeaway you want parents and loved ones to get from your book?

Breyer: I hope that it would allow parents to have a greater appreciation for differences in style, of themselves, of their particular children, and maybe particularly if the styles are different. So I would hope that also they can get the idea that there may be things that they can do themselves or get other people to do to help their child if their child seems to be getting very depressed or anxious. And there are lots of ways that the child can be helped.

Also, I suppose the other thing is that I would like them to get the idea that they need to look after themselves as well, because if they're not in good shape, it's going to be awfully difficult for them to help their child. Put on your own oxygen mask first before helping anybody else. I suppose that's one of the hopes, which is to get them to focus on themselves a little bit and they're not doing that for a selfish reason, they're doing it because that's the way they're going to be able to best help their child.",Navigating the challenges of having a child who is very ill,http://cnn.com/2018/06/25/health/when-your-child-is-sick-breyer-book/index.html
308,308,2018-05-17 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Pottstown, Pennsylvania (CNN) Paul Steklenski has saved more than 1,000 dogs' lives in the last three years.

Twice a month, the Army veteran loads about 15 animals on to a small plane and flies them from high-kill shelters in the southern US to rescue groups up north.

""These animals are perfectly fine and healthy and adoptable -- (they) just can't get out of kill shelters to that freedom,"" Steklenski said. ""They are getting a private flight to save their lives.""

His efforts -- and the need -- led him to start his nonprofit, Flying Fur Animal Rescue , in 2015. But this mission was never something he'd set out to do.

In 2013, Steklenski began working at a company closer to his home, which led him to the idea of becoming a pilot.

""I started driving to my new job, and I would pass this small airfield,"" said Steklenski, a network engineer. ""I don't know why, but I just decided one day to go in and sign up for flying lessons.""

While training to get his pilot license, his family decided to adopt a dog. The process opened his eyes to a world he didn't know existed.

""You learn about this huge underground railroad of people who volunteer their time, money, and energy to get these animals out of kill shelters,"" Steklenski said. ""I became so aware and more compassionate to all animals.""

He got his license a few months later and realized he could do more than fly for recreation.

""I thought, this is a way I can use an ability I have to help move a large amount of animals in a short amount of time,"" he said.

Since starting the organization, Steklenski has completed nearly 100 flights to save animals, all paid for out of his own pocket. The organization now has its own plane and transports to rescue groups in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

""We're only in the plane for a short period of time, but that time is so precious to me,"" he said. ""There are moments we share in that plane that I will never forget.""

CNN's Meghan Dunn spoke with Steklenski about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: What did you learn about the need in rescuing these animals?

Paul Steklenski: There is a huge need to help get animals out of kill shelters. I learned that if they don't get out of certain areas of this country, they don't live. The further South you get, the worse it gets. And there are so many organizations up north that are no-kill that will take these animals.

Once I became an airman, it was natural. Knowing that I could take a day off from work and quite literally help save the lives of a dozen or more animals just by doing this, that was it. I didn't need to know any more.

CNN: What's it like to be on such a small plane with more than a dozen dogs?

Steklenski: Every dog that steps foot on our plane is a 'paw-senger.' I'll look to who is the most scared or the most terrified and know that if I put them next to me, they'll be calmed. A lot of times depending on the size of my copilot, he'll kind of shimmy over, and get on my lap and fall asleep.

JUST WATCHED CNN Heroes: Top Dog Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Heroes: Top Dog 01:09

Usually once the engine starts up, they hear the noise and the vibration -- everybody settles in. Some will look out the window or they'll fall asleep. It's usually a non-event. It's preferable to flying with people in a lot of ways!

But it's bittersweet in the sense that you've got to spend maybe two hours with them, and they start to bond with you a little bit, and now they're moving on. It's just what you have to do; they have to move on to their next step.

CNN: You dedicate a lot of time to flying animals. How do you juggle it with your full-time job?

Steklenski: My full-time job helps pay for this. I spend over $1,000 a month out of my pocket to do this. I need my job to fulfill these missions and help save these animals.

When I look back in time, when I was renting airplanes all the time and had to drive an hour to the airport with crates in my truck -- I look back now, I'm like, ""Wow, you were nuts."" It's just not something you really focus on. You're focused on what the next mission is, what's the next group of dogs I need to help. When it's something you're very passionate about, I don't think you really measure the amount of energy or time or sacrifice you put into it. You just do it.

CNN: What's the future of the organization look like?

Steklenski: The future of Flying Fur is take us to the next level and get a dedicated farm in Pennsylvania with an airstrip that I can fly animals into directly, where we can have an intake and adoption and rehab center.

I also want to upgrade our aircraft to something bigger that can go further. I don't know how I'm going to get there yet, and it's going to take a lot of money. But that's my challenge. I've made it this far in three years. It's on my shoulders now to figure out how to get us to where we need to be.

309,309,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Washington (CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended the administration's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy in a speech Monday as criticism over the resulting separation of parents and children entered a new week.

Speaking to a gathering of school resource officers in Reno, Nevada, Sessions blamed Obama-era border directives for forcing action on a trend of immigrants crossing as families that had ""surged dramatically,"" and sought to associate the young children with high caretaking costs and public safety threats.

But he also tempered his rhetoric with a nod to the humanitarian backlash being driven by daily reports of the more than 2,000 boys and girls who had been separated from their parents and placed in detention centers and shelters across the country.

""We're going to continue to prosecute those adults who enter here illegally. We're going to do everything in our power, however, to avoid separating families. All federal agencies are working hard to accomplish this goal,"" Sessions said.

The Justice Department on Thursday asked a California court to modify a federal order limiting the ability of US officials to detain immigrant children for more than 20 days -- a central thrust of the executive order signed by President Donald Trump last week that was widely seen as a reversal of the hardline tactic.

CNN was not immediately able to reach Nike for comment.

Counterfeit industry

The decision is sure to fuel the market for counterfeit jerseys. Fake versions of the Nigeria kit have been openly on sale in Nigeria for at least a month.

CNN recently visited a bustling business district of downtown Lagos and found shops selling replica versions of several World Cup kits including Brazil and England.

A counterfeit kit seller sorts her wares in her shop in Lagos on May 31 2018 ahead of the official release of the Nigeria World Cup kit.

The replica jerseys are made in Thailand, one of the sellers told us and were selling for between $20 to $40 depending on the quality, while more lower grades can go for around $5.

Seller Ronke Oni told CNN the anticipation for kits before they were released on Friday fueled demand for the replicas.

""People started buying the 1994 US World Cup jersey a lot when the new Nigeria jersey didn't come out early. I got the new Nigeria jersey last month from Thailand. It sells faster and it's cheaper. The most popular one is the home jersey. It's hotcake right now.""

Oni told CNN she mostly sells the fake jerseys online and via social media.

""Most Nigerians, I don't think can afford the original,"" she said. ""The replica is the same as the original, except you look closely at it.""

Some analysts think that Nike waited too long to make the kits available and created space for bootleggers like Oni to cash in on demand.

Sport journalist Godwin Dudu-Orumen, who runs a sports academy in Lagos, said: ""The kits are not readily available. If I want to buy one and I can't find it, more than likely the man on the street will go for the one that's fake. They need to ensure that the kit arrives in good time, don't wait until expectations are climbing.""

""Four to six weeks ago, someone asked me but I didn't know where to get one and now fake kits are being sold on the streets. You can dilute that demand by making the kit available in good time.""

Football kit economies

Kits deals can be highly lucrative to football federations.

The Nigeria Football Football Federation (NFF) entered into a three-and-half-year partnership with Nike to make the country's kits in 2015. The deal was worth $3.75m and a $500,000 bonus if the ""Super Eagles"" qualified for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, according to Goal.com.

The NFF previously had a deal with German sportswear brand Adidas, joining countries such as Australia, Brazil, England, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa, the US and South Korea.

Meanwhile England's 12-year kit deal with Nike is reportedly worth $457 million.

Recently the NFF complained about how counterfeiters can potentially ruin such lucrative deals.

""The people who will criticise the NFF for not getting a so-called big sponsorship kit deal are the same ones who will undermine our ability to do so by buying the counterfeit jerseys,"" NFF head Shehu Dikko said in an interview with ESPN.

Most of the sellers that CNN spoke to in Lagos didn't seem to understand why it was wrong to sell fake goods.

Oni acknowledged, when pressed, that what she was doing was illegal, however, for her and other sellers, it all boils down to affordability.

Nearly half of Nigeria's 196 million population live in poverty, according to the World Poverty Clock agency.

The minimum wage in Nigeria is around $50 per month and very few have a disposable income to splash on luxuries such as football kits, even in a country as football mad as Nigeria.

Analyst Dudu-Orumen says it is inevitable that people here will always be attracted to the cheaper alternative, even when it is fake.",Nigeria World Cup kit sells out in minutes as fakes flood Lagos markets,http://cnn.com/2018/06/01/africa/nigeria-world-cup-kit-intl/index.html

""It's obviously not acceptable,"" Scaramucci said of Trump's tweet.

He said Trump should focus more on his accomplishments than on attacking others.

""I don't think he's doing the right thing, because he's the President of the United States and he's won. He's got a great policy in place. He's executing a broad-based policy that's leading to, by and large, prosperity in the United States,"" Scaramucci said.

He emphasized that there will be ""peace and prosperity around the world"" as a result of Trump's policies, and said the President's communications should focus on that.

Scaramucci explained he believes that Trump thinks going on the offensive is his best defense strategy against supposed media bias against him.

""I think he thinks that he's doing the right thing. I think he thinks that he's been painted into a corner by the media,"" Scaramucci said. ""I think he thinks that there's a 91% negative bias, according to Harvard or Pew Research, all these different places. And he feels he has to counterpunch his way out of that corner, and he has to galvanize his base and let his base know he's not going to sit there and stand for that 91% media bias.""

Trump, as part of his tweet about about Waters, wrote, ""She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!"" which some have interpreted as a threat.

Scaramucci said he did not see the statement as a threat.

""I didn't see that as a threat, but this is now the problem. Because it's so heavily escalated, a lot of people see that as a threat,"" Scaramucci said.

312,312,2018-06-22 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) On Sunday, Saudi Arabia will end the world's only ban on women drivers.

For the first time in its history, women will be able to drive themselves legally through the ultra-conservative kingdom's streets.

The landmark step is the culmination of years of activism and appeals from inside and outside the Gulf nation. But, while a welcome development, activists say the battle for women's rights is far from over.

Why are women being allowed to drive now?

The move comes as part of a series of sweeping social and economic reforms known as Vision 2030. Initiated over the past two years, the reforms have been spearheaded by Saudi Arabia's 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

The end of the driving ban will allow many more women to join the workforce , a key goal for the Crown Prince. Until now, many Saudi women have had to employ male drivers, something that eats into their salaries and is prohibitive for some.

A royal decree was issued in September announcing the end of the ban in June 2018. Since then, the kingdom has been readying itself for a historic shift that will bring it into line with the rest of the world.

Earlier this month, the kingdom issued its first driver's licenses to 10 Saudi women in exchange for licenses they'd acquired while abroad.

In January, ride-hailing applications Uber and Careem said they were recruiting female drivers for when the ban lifts.

A woman tries a driving simulator at a government-organized road safety event at Riyadh Park Mall in the Saudi capital on Thursday.

What's the background to this?

The lifting of the driving ban comes 28 years after Saudi women first took to the streets of the capital, Riyadh, to protest for the right to drive. The 47 Saudi women who drove in a motorcade through the city were all arrested, and the country's highest religious body issued an edict banning female driving, adding what had been a customary ban to the legal code.

JUST WATCHED Saudi activist hails end of ban on women driving Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Saudi activist hails end of ban on women driving 04:42

The decades that followed the 1990 Riyadh protest were peppered with movements to lift the ban, but they came to a head around the time of the Arab Spring in 2011. A social-media campaign called Women2Drive culminated in activist Manal al-Sharif posting a video of herself driving in the Saudi city of Khobar on YouTube -- a move that landed her in jail. She now lives in Australia.

Other activists also emerged at the forefront of the movement. Loujain al-Hathloul was detained for 73 days in 2014 after trying to drive from the United Arab Emirates to Saudi Arabia. Eman al-Nafjan, a well-known blogger, drove in Riyadh in 2013 as part of a protest that attracted international attention. Aziza al-Yousef, who is 70, was one of the country's earliest activists for the right to drive and signed a petition in recent years calling for an end to guardianship laws.

The crackdown came on the heels of bin Salman's month-long tour of Western countries, where he was billed as a modernizer spearheading change.

What other rights have Saudi women gained?

Over the past year, Saudi Arabia has opened its first cinema in decades and loosened several morality laws that discriminate against women, including its notorious rules requiring that women receive a male guardian's permission to travel, receive an education and sometimes work and receive health care.

The kingdom also announced that Saudi mothers would now be able to retain custody of their children after divorce without filing lawsuits. In doing so, it broke ranks with several other countries in the region that heavily favor male guardianship.

Women are also now permitted to attend certain sporting events.

In 2015 women cast ballots for the first time ever during municipal elections, a vote in which they were also allowed to campaign for public office. But female candidates weren't allowed to speak to male voters and couldn't have men and women mixing in their campaign offices.

At least 17 women were elected during the 2015 municipal vote . The late King Abdullah issued a decree in 2011 that gave women the vote and two years later, ordered that at least 20% of seats in the Consultative Council be set aside for women.

Female Saudi soccer fans attend a match at the King Abdullah Sports City in Jeddah on January 12.

What rights do Saudi women still not have?

Saudi Arabia, which adheres to some of the strictest interpretations of Sunni Islam in the world, has long been accused of formal legal discrimination against women.

Women still are beholden to restrictive guardianship laws that govern nearly every aspect of their lives, despite recent moves to ease them. In cases where a woman's father is deceased or absent, her husband, a male relative, brother, or in some cases, even a son, must give his approval before a woman can obtain often basic entitlements.

Some exceptions include Saudi women still cannot mix freely with members of the opposite sex.Some exceptions include hospitals, banks and medical colleges . They also cannot appear in public without wearing a full-length black abaya, a loose robe meant to protect women's modesty in public.

Rights group Amnesty International on Thursday welcomed the lifting of the driving ban as ""a long-overdue small step in the right direction"" but said it ""must now be followed by reforms to end a whole range of discriminatory laws and practices,"" including an end to the guardianship system.

The group also highlighted the plight of rights activists who remain imprisoned following last month's crackdown and may face trial before the country's counterterrorism court.

""It is outrageous that women are still treated like second-class citizens in Saudi Arabia,"" it said. ""If Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman truly believes himself to be a reformer, he should free the women's rights activists, and include activists and civil society members in Saudi Arabia's reform process.""",Saudi women driving ban is ending: What you need to know,http://cnn.com/2018/06/22/middleeast/saudi-women-driving-ban-end-intl/index.html

Speaking to Sky News last weekend, she described her son's case as ""a wake-up call for our country"" and said she was determined no other child should undergo the same ""horrendous experience"" that had left her son's mind and body ""completely broken"" and in a ""vulnerable state.""

On Tuesday, Javid told the House of Commons that it was ""time to review the scheduling of cannabis"" for medicinal use, in light of cases like that of Billy and 6-year-old Alfie Dingley, who also has severe epilepsy.

""It has become clear to me since becoming Home Secretary that the position we find ourselves in is not satisfactory,"" he said. ""It is not satisfactory for the parents, it is not satisfactory for the doctors and it is not satisfactory for me.""

However, Javid made clear that the government had no plans to relax its stance on the recreational use of marijuana -- unlike Canada, which on Tuesday voted to legalize its use across the country.

Six-year-old Alfie Dingley poses before meeting with UK lawmakers in Parliament on March 20.

What happens next?

Under UK law, marijuana is currently categorized as schedule 1, defined as having no medicinal value and therefore unable to be prescribed by doctors. Javid said this schedule would be reconsidered under a two-part review.

The first part, led by the government's chief medical officer, Professor Sally Davies, will weigh the evidence available for the medicinal and therapeutic benefits of cannabis-based medicines, Javid said.

The review will decide which forms of cannabis or cannabis-based medicines should be considered in the second part of the review, led by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. This will assess ""based on the balance of harms and public health needs"" what may need to be rescheduled, Javid said.

""If the review identifies that there are significant medical benefits, we will reschedule. We have seen in ​recent months that there is a pressing need to allow those who might benefit from cannabis-based products to access them,"" he said.

At present, Sativex, an oral spray used as a treatment for multiple sclerosis, is the only cannabis-based medicine recognized in the UK to have medicinal properties.

Former UK Conservative Party leader William Hague, who now sits in the House of Lords, called for the UK government to ""embrace a decisive change"" in the law on medicinal and regulated recreational cannabis use, in an opinion piece in Britain's Telegraph newspaper.

Billy's case ""provides one of those illuminating moments when a longstanding policy is revealed to be inappropriate, ineffective and utterly out of date,"" he wrote.

""It must now be asked whether Britain should join the many other countries that permit medical-grade marijuana, or indeed join Canada in preparing for a lawful, regulated market in cannabis for recreational use as well.""

But Javid ruled out the latter step as he announced the review, saying the government has ""absolutely no plans to legalize cannabis, and the penalties for unauthorized supply and possession will remain unchanged. We will not set a dangerous precedent or weaken our ability to keep dangerous drugs off the streets.""

American doctor Frank D'Ambrosio, author of the book ""'Cannabis Is Medicine: The A-Z Of Medical Marijuana,"" will on Wednesday brief British lawmakers who are seeking to change the law on the medicinal use of cannabis.

What is the case for medical marijuana use?

The benefits are attributed to two main components of cannabis: the psychoactive component THC or the plant's extract, the non-psychoactive cannabidiol (CBD) oil.

The latter is linked to easing anxiety as well as epileptic seizures, which could be life-saving for children with a severe form of epilepsy.

Tom Freeman, senior academic fellow at King's College London, said Billy's case highlighted the urgent need for cannabis to be rescheduled.

""Removing cannabis from schedule 1 would facilitate the treatment of many more young people experiencing debilitating symptoms like Billy,"" he said. ""It would also help scientists to develop new and more effective cannabinoid-based medicines for a range of other conditions.""

David Nutt, professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, said he believed the government should act to move the control of drugs from the Home Office, which is responsible for policing, to the Department of Health, which is able to evaluate medical claims.

""There will be many other people in the UK with severe epilepsy who are likely to benefit from medical cannabis and provision must be made to stop them suffering brain damage and death from cannabis-treatable seizures,"" he said.

However, Dr. Michael Bloomfield, clinical lecturer in general psychiatry at University College London, cautioned that while the current laws are too strict in certain cases, like Billy's, the issue of medicinal marijuana use is far from straightforward and ""needs a scientific evidence base in the form of medical trials.""

He warned that medical marijuana use ""has become for many jurisdictions a potential way of decriminalizing cannabis through the back door in a way that may be associated with reductions in the perceived harm of the drug"" and increased heavy use by young people.

The issues currently confronting UK lawmakers have already prompted policy changes elsewhere in the world.

Canada this week became the second country in the world -- and the first G7 nation -- to implement legislation to permit a nationwide marijuana market. In the neighboring US, nine states and the District of Columbia now allow for recreational marijuana use, and 30 allow for medicinal use.

As World Cup opening ceremonies go, it was low-key, but what was not missing was the passionate chants of fans from both sides of the turf.

Welcome to the alternative World Cup, ""Barawa 2018"" -- the tournament for people whose nations didn't get a chance to compete or qualify for the official World Cup.

The tournament is made of up players from minority groups and unrecognized nations and those who are not members of FIFA.

It is organized by CONIFA, the Confederation of Independent Football Associations , but the London-based diaspora team of Barawa (a region in Somalia) are the official hosts.

The CONIFA logo.

It runs from May 31 to June 9 and also features players from Matabeleland, a southwestern region in Zimbabwe , with a rich but fraught history -- including a series of state-led massacres in 1983

CONIFA represents 334 million people worldwide and, for some of the teams, it's the first time they have competed at this global level.

The openning ceremony in south London.

Its members include football teams from nations such as Tibet, Rohingya, Darfur, Northern Cyprus among many other ""minority peoples and sports isolated territories,"" according to CONIFA.

The competition features 16 teams and is taking place in the stadia of English lower league teams across London.

Barawa v Tamil Eelam at Bromley FC Stadium.

""CONIFA is different to FIFA, in essence, because CONIFA recognizes unrecognized states,"" said Omar Sufi, team captain of hosts Barawa FA.

""This tournament is important globally because we're playing against different teams from different backgrounds and we're all coming here together with the same value,"" said Sufi.

A global stage

To become a member of FIFA, a nation needs to be recognized by the international community, and only one football association from each country is allowed, unless permitted otherwise.

CONIFA was set up for those nations and people who are restricted by these rules.

It is a global non-profit and was founded in Sweden in 2013. Since then, the tournament has gone from strength to strength, and interest in becoming a member of CONIFA has grown rapidly since its inception. The previous tournament in 2016 was held in Abkhazia in Georgia, where the host nation won.

The organization is certainly a far cry from the global spectacle of the FIFA World Cup, but the standard, given the limited resources, is surprisingly good.

With FIFA mired in scandal after scandal , this growing football tournament, which is both global and grassroots, is a platform for teams, like Matabeleland, to play with pride.

World Cup first-timers

Matabeleland is the only team from southern Africa, and, unlike other diaspora teams at the World Football Club, their players have all traveled to London from Zimbabwe for the tournament.

The region is named after the Ndebele people who live there, but the area itself also includes Tonga, Kalanga, Venda and other ethnic groups.

Justin Walley, who was previously running a football club in the Latvian national league for the past decade, is the coach of Matabeleland and CONIFA's Africa Director.

He packed his bags and moved from the Baltic region to the hot terrain of southwestern Zimbabwe. ""I've spent four and a half months in total out in Zimbabwe coaching,"" Walley told CNN.

The team, known as the ""Warrior Birds,"" have been training in advance of their first game against Padania, from northern Italy, one of the favorites and the current European CONIFA champions.

Unfortunately for them, the European champs took a decisive 6-1 victory on Thursday.

However, the games are clearly about more than just winning.

It's a chance to unify people around the beautiful game, and promote football in the region.

Busani Sibindi is the president and founder of Matabeleland Football Confederacy, which formed in 2016.

""One of the objectives was to provide equity within the country in terms of sports promotion, because sports are also a unifier is some way. There's skewed irregularities in terms of sports investment in the country,"" said Sibindi.

The team have also had the coaching and playing help of a footballing legend, former Liverpool and Zimbabwe goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar.

However, it hasn't always been plain sailing. The biggest mission hasn't been getting match-ready, but actually getting to the tournament itself.

Unsurprisingly, CONIFA doesn't have the sort of resources that FIFA has, which means Matabeleland have had to crowd fund their trip to London.

They launched an online fundraising campaign and have sold football jerseys to raise money.

The squad managed to make it to London, along with the 15 other teams.

318,318,2018-06-22 00:00:00,cnn.com,"On her Goop website, Gwyneth Paltrow claimed that charcoal lemonade was one of the "" best juice cleansers "". That was in 2014. Today, charcoal products -- from croissants to capsules -- are everywhere. Even high street coffee chains have taken to selling charcoal ""shots"".

Some vendors of these products claim that activated charcoal can boost your energy, brighten your skin and reduce wind and bloating. The main claim, though, is that these products can detoxify your body.

It's easy to see where the claim that activated charcoal can detoxify the body comes from: it is used in emergency medicine to reduce the toxic load when someone has consumed poison or overdosed on medication . Charcoal binds to poison in the gastrointestinal tract and stops it from being absorbed into the bloodstream. The toxins are then passed out of the body in the stool.

However, this detoxifying action is another case of the non-scientific nutritionists seeing the medical use for something and misinterpreting its application.

Four reasons to avoid it

Although consuming activated charcoal may seem like a harmless health trend, there are several reasons you should avoid these products.

Activated charcoal will bind with all kinds of things including some of the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants in your food. Charcoal is sometimes added to fruit or vegetable juice and sold as a ""shot"". Unfortunately, the vitamins in the fruit and veg probably won't be absorbed because of the charcoal. You'd be better off just having the juice.

Activated charcoal can bind with some medications, including some antidepressants and anti-inflammatory medications, causing them to be less effective. This could have serious health consequences for some people, but it's not explained on bottles or packaging where activated charcoal is being sold.

Activated charcoal will only bind with whatever particles are in your stomach or intestines at the time that you take it. It works by coming into physical contact with your intestinal contents. If you're trying to use it to detox from the alcohol and kebab you had the night before, it won't do anything at all because they have been absorbed into your bloodstream already.

Activated charcoal slows down your bowel and is known to cause nausea and constipation (and black stools).

Gas and bloating

In the 1980s some research suggested that activated charcoal can bind with gases produced during digestion and reduce wind and bloating. They showed that if you eat a meal that typically causes gas and then take charcoal, it reduces the amount of gas that is produced. However, there were later studies showing that this was not of benefit when taken as a supplement alongside the participants' normal diets.

These studies are very old, and while activated charcoal may help to reduce wind under certain circumstances, for some people, because of the effects it also has on binding nutrients and drugs, it is not recommended for managing wind and bloating.

There are great treatments for wind and bloating that are really effective, such as reducing the fermentable carbohydrates in your diet ( the low FODMAP diet ) and the use of certain probiotics for irritable bowel syndrome.

Everyone is looking for a quick fix to wellness, and while we are all struggling with maintaining our energy levels, eating well and exercising while living busy lives, it is easy to be sucked in by clever marketing and celebrity endorsements.

The detox market is huge and highly misleading. While the common perception is that our daily lives and dietary habits (including alcohol intake) cause a build up of ""toxins"" in our system, there are no products or diets that will impact on this, regardless of their marketing budget or how many ""influencers"" tell you otherwise. We are often sold the idea that our diets are somehow ""toxic"" when the reality is that, aside from ingesting poison, even fast food doesn't contain anything toxic.",Four reasons to skip an activated charcoal 'detox',http://cnn.com/2018/06/22/health/activated-charcoal-partner/index.html

320,320,2018-06-22 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Thomas Weber is a professor of history and international affairs at the University of Aberdeen and author of "" Becoming Hitler: The Making of a Nazi "" (Basic Books) . Follow him on Twitter @Thomas__Weber . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) On March 21, 1933, Germany was in turmoil. Less than two months after the Nazi seizure of power, even people with pro-regime leanings felt disquieted about the draconian measures instituted since the end of January.

It was in this context that Protestant theologian Otto Dibelius invoked the biblical passage Romans 13 to urge Germans to support Hitler. As the nation looked upon him that day, in his sermon in front of the newly elected members of the Reichstag (parliament), Dibelius told Germans that they had learned from Martin Luther that Christians may not fail to support the state, ""even not when [the state] acts hard and ruthlessly.""

In his sermon, held in Potsdam, Dibelius reminded people how, during his own days, Luther had called upon state authorities to act ""without mercy"" to restore order. Eighty-five years later, as US Attorney General Jeff Sessions invoked Romans 13 to tell Americans that they should support the since-abandoned administration policy of forcefully separating children from their parents who crossed the border illegally, it is hard not to think about the parallels.

I have spent the last three and a half years warning against facile Trump-Hitler comparisons. More often than not, they simply do not work and may, in fact, backfire. Hitler-Trump comparisons are a distraction from the President's very own and dangerous shortcomings. There is also the ""the crying wolf problem.""

If Hitler is invoked too often, people will get numb to it and won't listen anymore when the new Hitlers really do come, as arguably has already happened elsewhere in the world. Although Trump is not comparable to Hitler and Sessions seems to have since changed his stance on the family separating policy, it's worth studying the lessons of history.

On this occasion, the parallels are eerie and scary. It was not just on March 21, 1933 -- the ""Day of Potsdam"" that saw the marriage of the old Prussian establishment with the Nazi regime, symbolized by Hitler's famous handshake with German President Paul von Hindenburg -- that Romans 13 was invoked.

JUST WATCHED Sessions admits policy is a deterrent Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sessions admits policy is a deterrent 02:04

Throughout the lifetime of the Third Reich, in tens of thousands of sermons up and down the country, pro-Nazi Protestant pastors quoted from Romans 13: ""The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.""

In short, as the Nazi regime imprisoned its opponents and wrought havoc across the world, Romans 13 became one of the glues that held the Third Reich together.

The scripture had the effect of preventing, or at least delaying, the emergence of more widespread resistance against Nazi policies. The powerful writings of anti-Nazi Protestant theologians Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer are testament as to how much Protestants in Germany were battling with what the particular verse.

For instance, in his book ""Church and State,"" Barth discussed at great lengths how Romans 13 calls upon Christians to obey the rules of the state they live in, however concluding, in effect, that the actions of Jesus himself contradicted the narrow reading of Romans 13 favored by the Nazis: ""Christians would, in point of fact, become enemies of any State if, when the State threatens their freedom, they did not resist, or if they concealed their resistance -- although this resistance would be very calm and dignified. Jesus would, in actual fact, have been an enemy of the State if He had not dared, quite calmly, to call King Herod a 'fox'... If the State has perverted its God-given authority, it cannot be honored better than by this criticism which is due to it in all circumstances,"" Barth wrote.

Barth thus ultimately concluded that Romans 13 does, in fact, not call upon people blindly to obey the state. Quite to the contrary, according to Barth, Paul's epistle to the Romans requires people to rise against the state when the state is the source of injustice.

It was that interpretation of Romans 13 that made Bonhoeffer join the resistance to Hitler, a decision that would cost his own life. (He was arrested and later sent to a concentration camp where he was executed) And it was that interpretation of the scripture that drove the plotters behind the famous attempt on Hitler's life on July 20, 1944.

Wehrmacht officer Heinrich Graf von Lehndorff, who was executed for his involvement in the plot to kill Hitler, also struggled with what Romans 13 truly meant. He had already inwardly turned against Hitler after witnessing a massacre of 7,000 Jews by the Einsatztruppen in October 1941.

Yet for Protestant aristocrats like him, whose families had served the state for hundreds of years, overcoming a narrow and literal reading of Romans 13 was difficult. As his cousin Hans von Lehndorff was to recall, even the last time he saw Heinrich, a few days before the attempt on Hitler's life, they talked about Romans 13: ""One matter at least became clear to us,"" Hans wrote in his memoirs, ""the apostle did not warrant us, through an invocation of the Epistle to the Romans, not to do anything and thus save our souls. He let us merely see, how heavy the decision did weigh, which we saw us confronted with, guilt or guilt.""

I have no doubt that the Trump administration was unaware of these parallels with the Nazi past when it decided to separate children from their parents and when it invoked Romans 13.

Since it seems that this topic will be a lingering issue, it is not too late for Sessions -- and anyone in the administration who agreed with his use of the scripture to garner support -- to change direction on the broader and even more important issue relating to Romans 13, namely whether or not Americans should follow the rule of law based on a Nazi understanding of the matter.

If families are not reunited or if some are still separated because of lack of available resources, or, in fact, if the administration oversteps its powers on a policy matter, then the public has a right and the duty to express their outrage over the administration's actions. It is the administration's choice to decide if they want to be, fairly or not, compared with the Nazi regime or with Hitler's opponents.

322,322,2018-06-23 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (CNN) Saudi women drivers took to the roads legally Sunday for the first time in the kingdom's history, as its decades-old ban on women driving finally lifted.

The end of the controversial ban brings the ultra-conservative Gulf nation into line with the rest of the world. It also represents the culmination of years of campaigning by rights activists who have sometimes been arrested and imprisoned for their efforts.

More than 120,000 women applied for a driver's license Sunday, according to senior Ministry of Interior and Traffic Directorate officials.

""Demand for obtaining driving licenses is very high,"" said Maj. Gen. Mansour Al Turki, official spokesman of the Ministry of Interior.

Mona Al-Fares, a doctor, was in her car before midnight, waiting for the ban to lift before setting off through the streets of Jeddah with her husband and children.

""I feel like I'm surprised -- am I really driving in my own country? I feel happy, relieved. I feel like I'm free,"" she told CNN.

The step, first announced last September , will liberate many women from the constraints of needing to hire a male driver to travel even small distances, allowing many more to join the workforce, grow their own businesses and explore the kingdom.

Hiring women is a key part of Saudi Arabia's ambitious plan to overhaul its economy, known as Vision 2030. The reform agenda is being spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

For some, though, the jubilation at realizing a hard-won freedom Sunday will be tempered by the arrests last month of a number of Saudi rights activists, including some who have played a prominent role in the fight for women's right to drive.

Many other restrictions on women's everyday lives remain in place under the male guardianship system -- including the right to marry, work or travel.

Saudi woman Sabika Habib drives her car through the streets of Khobar City on her way to Bahrain on Sunday.

Women and their families began posting photos and videos of them driving and celebrating as soon as the ban lifted.

In Riyadh, Aliah Naser watched as her mother, Romoush Bana, drove for the first time and posted an image of the moment to Instagram.

""My reaction: I was super excited about this change in Saudi and really hope that everyone can have fun and enjoy these changes in Saudi Arabia,"" she told CNN. ""She was scared a little but she did it in the end.""

Baheirah Khusheim, 33, described how just after midnight she followed a route her late father had taken her on as an 18-year-old girl, dressed in her brother's clothing, ""as he wanted me to have a real driving experience.""

""It is a remarkable historic moment that I wish all the world would be here to witness it,"" she said.

Khusheim said she had picked up her Saudi license in Mecca. ""The support from the community and officers was remarkable. As soon as you leave the license office, all you will hear is BEEP! BEEP! ""MABROOK! CONGRATS!"" from random strangers. It's a thrilling experience.""

A spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry told a news conference that 120,000 women had applied for driving licenses in Saudi Arabia, according to state media Al-Ekhbariya TV.

Reema al-Bawardy, 28, took her 10 cousins on a drive across Jeddah at midnight as soon as the ban was lifted. They packed the big black SUV again on Sunday afternoon for another drive to an upscale coffee house in the Rawda neighborhood. Out of the 11 people in the vehicle, two had driving licenses.

The celebratory rides will go on for a few days, she told CNN. ""After that they have to learn how to drive.""

Walaa Abou Najem, 30, drives her car for the first time through the streets of Riyadh early Sunday.

""Finally, first ride with my daughter @Reem_Alwaleed while she's driving me and my grand daughters in Riyadh,"" he tweeted

Others were more skeptical about the much-touted advance.

""This is not an achievement,"" one woman, who gave her name only as Yasmin, told CNN in Jeddah. ""An achievement is something you worked and fought hard for, like being the first ambassador or minister or astronaut. That would be something worth celebrating.""

Her friend Batoul interjected. ""At the end this doesn't solve the problem. Public transportation does, and this is what would make the difference for the women who really need it.""

'Women can't drive'

The kingdom had already issued its first driver's licenses to a handful of Saudi women, in exchange for ones they acquired while overseas.

It also staged events last week in the cities of Riyadh, Dammam, Jeddah and Tabuk to raise awareness of road safety and traffic laws. Women who were new to driving could try out driving simulators and practice parking.

Women take part in a government-organized road safety event at Riyadh Park Mall, in the Saudi capital, on Thursday.

It may take some time, however, to change the attitudes of those opposed to the ban lifting.

""Women can't drive and they are unqualified,"" Khaled Abdullah Al-Houba, a 42-year-old state employee, told CNN on Saturday. He was sitting with his wife and children at the busy walkway overlooking the Red Sea in Jeddah.

""The society is not used to women driving,"" he said. For him, the decision taken last September was implemented too soon. ""Women need at least two years to learn driving,"" he said, ""so the women can be ready and society gets ready.""

He would consider allowing his daughters to apply for a license in the future, he said, but for now, ""Saudi women still don't have the guts needed to drive.""

Activists arrested

Among the women's rights advocates arrested last month were Loujain Al-Hathloul, who was previously detained for 73 days in 2014 after trying to drive from the United Arab Emirates to Saudi Arabia, and Aziza al-Yousef, 70, one of the country's earliest activists for the right to drive.

Both remain in custody, rights group Amnesty International said Thursday.

Those detained were accused of ""suspicious contact with foreign entities,"" according to a statement on Saudi Arabia's official news agency.

Rights groups have condemned the crackdown and voiced fears that it could presage a closing down of Saudi civil society.

Saudi activist and author Manal al-Sharif, who was jailed in Saudi Arabia in 2011 after posting a video on YouTube of herself driving a car, tweeted Sunday that she was the first Saudi women to be given a ticket.

""The first Saudi traffic violation that was issued to a woman was actually for me for driving without a license on May 19th, 2011,"" she said, adding that she paid 900 Riyals, or $240.

Sharif told CNN last month that she had planned to visit the country from Australia, where she now lives, but had canceled the upcoming trip out of fear for her safety following the arrests of activists.

""We are back to square one,"" she said. ""We used to live in a police state; if you speak up you go to jail. And then there would be a defamation campaign against you, saying all sort of untrue things. Character assassination. We are seeing that same pattern again now.""

Sharif also told CNN that after Saudi authorities announced plans to allow women to drive, they called her and asked her not to speak to the media about it.

Amnesty: 'Bravery and determination'

In Thursday's statement, Amnesty International called for more reforms to follow the lifting of the driving ban -- and for the detained women's rights activists to be freed.

""The lifting of the ban is testament to the bravery and determination of the women's rights activists who have been campaigning on the issue since the 1990s, and the activists following up their groundbreaking work in subsequent campaigns since 2011,"" said Samah Hadid, Amnesty International's Middle East campaigns director.

""While we welcome the fact that women can finally get behind the wheel, we should not forget that many people are still behind bars for their work in fighting for women's rights in Saudi Arabia.""

Human Rights Watch said Wednesday that two more women's rights campaigners had been arrested in recent days ""in what appears to be an unrelenting crackdown on the women's rights movement."" It called for Saudi Arabia's western allies to pressure the kingdom to release all the detained activists unconditionally before they are sent for trial.

323,323,2018-06-25 00:00:00,cnn.com,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Nigerian Afrobeats star D'banj has lost his only son in a drowning incident, according to local media.

Daniel Oyebanjo III, who turned one in May, reportedly died in a swimming pool at the singer's Lagos home.

Although D'banj has not made a comment addressing the death directly, he posted a black background on his Instagram page with the caption: ""Trying times but my God is Always and Forever Faithful.""

D'banj, 38, was not in the country when the incident occurred. He was attending the BET awards in Los Angeles.

He is believed to be flying back to Nigeria to be with his wife, Lineo Kilgrow, local media reported.

The singer regularly shared pictures of his son on his Instagram page and posted an image of him changing Daniel's soiled diapers on Father's Day.

Meanwhile the Lagos state police command released a statement saying a delegation of officers had visited the family at their home in the Ikoyi suburb of Lagos on Monday but no one was home.

The statement asked D'banj and his wife to report the circumstances of the boy's death to the police station after their mourning period.

""It is expected that when the mourning period is over, the family should formally report the circumstances that led to the unfortunate death of little Daniel to the police. May his soul rest in peace. Amen,"" police spokesman Chike Oti wrote in the statement.

Celebrities and fans around the world have been posting their condolence messages to the family on social media.

May God comfort Dbanj and his house hold 🤲🏽 no amount of word is enough to heal or console at times like this but strength from the almighty to see you through it we pray for 🤲🏽 — Olamide Adedeji (@olamide_YBNL) June 25, 2018

Another Afropop star, Davido, who won the BET Awards' Best International Act on Sunday, offered his condolences to the star while receiving his award.

Davido also cited D'banj's influence in boosting the popularity of the Nigerian music industry globally in his acceptance speech.

D'banj won the same award in 2011.

The singer, whose real name is Oladapo Daniel Oyebanjo, was one of the frontrunners of the new wave of Nigeria's popular music style, Afrobeats , and had a global hit in 2012 with his infectious hit ""Oliver Twist.""",Nigerian singer D'banj loses son in swimming pool drowning,http://cnn.com/2018/06/25/africa/afrobeats-star-dbanj-son-drowns/index.html
324,324,2018-02-26 00:00:00,cnn.com,"(CNN) Keeping your heart healthy is about more than avoiding fast food and overly processed chow. You can also pump up your heart's health by choosing foods that will help reduce cholesterol, lower blood pressure and reduce inflammation.

Which food groups have the most science behind their heart-healthy claims?

Oats and barley

The cell walls of oats and barley contain a special type of soluble fiber called beta-glucan, which has a host of benefits for human health. Studies show that it blunts the body's insulin response and boosts immunity, and it may be protective during radiation and chemotherapy. But its role in cholesterol reduction is what counts for heart health.

""Beta-glucans bind to bile acids and cholesterol in the intestines and prevent their absorption into the body,"" CNN contributor and registered dietitian Lisa Drayer said. ""So, if you have high cholesterol, it would be a good idea to incorporate oats or oatmeal for breakfast on a regular basis.""

Other grains, such as rye, wheat and sorghum, contain beta-glucans but in much smaller quantities than oats and barley. Beta-glucans are also found in seaweed, baker's yeast and various species of mushrooms such as reishi, shiitake and maitake.

Research shows that eating 3 grams of beta-glucans a day will reduce cholesterol by up to 10%. According to Heart UK , a British charity dedicated to helping those with high cholesterol, you can accomplish by eating a bowl of oatmeal each day; adding 2 tablespoons of oat bran to your smoothie, soup or entree at lunch; and having an oatmeal cookie for a snack.

Heart UK says you can replace one of those oat servings with 150 grams (⅔ cup) of cooked pearl barley.

Salmon and other fatty fish

Fish oils, especially omega-3 fatty acids, are critical for maintaining a healthy heart. That means fatty fish such as salmon, albacore tuna, mackerel, herring, lake trout and sardines and crustaceans such as lobster, oysters and squid are the protein staples of a heart-healthy diet. They all contain health-protective omega-3s, specifically the long-chain variety known as LC omega-3, which contain eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

Long-chain omega-3s have been shown in human clinical trials to prevent heart attacks by helping the heart maintain its rhythm. Studies show that they also make blood less likely to clot, lower blood pressure, keep blood vessels healthy and less likely to narrow, reduce triglycerides and lower inflammation. Whew!

The shorter chain of omega-3, called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), is found abundantly in oils, plants, nuts and seeds, but evidence of its benefit is not as strong.

""The plant-based omega-3s in foods like flaxseed, walnuts and canola oil don't contain DHA and EPA,"" Drayer said. ""And while there are benefits to the plant ones as well, you can't count on them as a source for their longer-chain cousins, because they are not necessarily converted into them once they are in the body.""

Fatty fish like salmon have the most long-chain omega-3s, and the American Heart Association recommends adding a 3½-ounce serving to your diet at least twice a week. Children and pregnant women should be careful to consume fish with lower levels of mercury, the association says, such as fresh and water-packed canned salmon.

However, Drayer says, be careful how you prepare your catch.

""You can make healthy foods unhealthy depending on how you cook them,"" Drayer said. ""For example, if you deep-fry fish, all the unhealthy saturated or trans fat can outweigh the heart-healthy benefits. Ideally, you want to broil, bake, grill or poach -- but in water, not in oil. Oil will contribute lots of extra calories. If a menu doesn't specify, ask how the fish is poached.""

What if fatty fish is just not your thing?

""If you never eat fish, you might consider a fish-oil supplement because of all the research on omega-3's benefits for heart and brain health,"" Drayer said.

""There are some foods fortified with EPA and DHA omega-3s,"" added registered dietitian Rahaf Al Bochi, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""Some of them are eggs, milk, juices, peanut butter and margarine spreads.""

""So instead of having regular spread on your toast, you can add something to your diet that has an added heart benefit,"" Drayer said. ""Why not give yourself an added edge?""

Be aware that most fortified foods have a fraction of the omega-3s of fatty fish and may be the shorter-chain variety.

Dark leafy greens

Salad greens, spinach, kale, swiss chard, collard and mustard greens are rich in vitamins A, C, E and K and contain antioxidants that help rid toxins from the body. But it's their abundance of calcium, magnesium and potassium that puts them on the top 10 list for heart health.

""Potassium, magnesium and calcium are known to play a role in blood pressure regulation,"" said Al Bochi, who specializes in helping patients with Type 2 diabetes who are at high risk for heart disease.

""Potassium is known to help with limiting the effects of sodium on blood pressure,"" she explained, ""And it, along with magnesium and calcium, help the walls of the blood vessels relax, which increases blood flow and reduces blood pressure.""

Greens have minimal calories: One cup of spinach or Swiss chard is only 7 calories, and kale has 33. Nutritionists say it's usually best to get your calcium, magnesium and potassium from foods instead of supplements, so pile that plate high.

Plus, greens -- like most vegetables -- are full of fiber, which helps lower cholesterol levels, prevents constipation (and therefore hemorrhoids) and, by helping you feel full, helps with weight control. And of course, maintaining a healthy weight is a key to good heart health.

Nuts and seeds

Unsalted seeds and nuts are also high in potassium, magnesium and other minerals known to reduce blood pressure.

Studies on pistachios , for example, find that the nut can reduce blood vessel tightening (called peripheral vascular resistance), heart rate, blood pressure and cholesterol. According to one study , a single helping a day was better at lowering blood pressure than two helpings.

Walnuts, pecans, almonds, flaxseed, macadamia nuts and hazelnuts are also good choices. Walnuts are especially high in omega-3s but are the short-chain variety. Still, that's good for the heart.

""Though to a lesser extent than long-chain omega-3s,"" Drayer said, ""alpha linolenic acid (ALA) -- a short-chain omega-3 found in walnuts and flaxseed and canola oil -- has been associated with protection against high blood pressure and heart disease.""

But keep in mind that all nuts are extremely high in calories. So an American Heart Association recommended serving is going to seem tiny: about 1½ ounces or 2 tablespoons of nut butter. Beware of the added salt, sugar or chocolate that is so appealing on nuts -- not good for heart health.

Beets

A surprising choice? Beets turn out to be chock full of nitric oxide, which studies show can help open blood vessels and therefore lower your blood pressure. In fact, a small study of Australian men and women found that drinking 500 grams (about 2½ cups) of beet juice significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) within six hours.

That's not all. Beets and their juice are one of the only sources of betalain, a powerful antioxidant with high anti-inflammatory qualities, which has sparked research into how beets could be used to treat diseases caused by chronic inflammation, such as arthritis cancer and heart failure.

Avocados

Already eating a healthy diet? Be sure to add avocadoes once a day. A study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that replacing saturated fat with one nutrient-packed avocado a day could lead to up to a 13.5 milligrams-per-deciliter reduction in blood pressure. That could be enough to keep some people off blood pressure meds, researchers say.

Avocados are a rich source of monounsaturated fatty acids, which can lower both your total cholesterol and your ""bad"" cholesterol (LDL) while maintaining your ""good"" cholesterol (HDL) levels. They can also benefit insulin contro l, which can be very helpful to those with prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes.

Olive oil

A key component of the Mediterranean diet is the use of olive oil for cooking and for dressing salads and vegetables in place of more saturated fats, such as butter.

Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and has been shown to reduce blood pressure and both bad cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing good cholesterol.

HDL is often called the ""friendly scavenger"" because it scours the blood for bad cholesterol and gets rid of it before it clogs arteries. That's why having high levels of HDL is considered good for the heart.

recent study of 300 Spanish men and women at high risk for cardiovascular events sheds some light on how the higher HDL from olive oil might work. Researchers compared people who ate a Mediterranean diet based on nuts and a group based on olive oil. The group who ate more olive oil had better-functioning HDL; in other words, their HDL was more efficient at finding and removing LDL and sending it to the liver as waste.

Regardless of how it works, olive oil is extremely high in calories. It should be used in moderation and as a replacement for more unhealthy fats in the diet.

Legumes

No heart-healthy list would be complete without legumes, which include all kinds of beans, lentils, chickpeas and black-eyed peas.

Legumes help the heart because of their high levels of soluble fiber, which is known to lower both cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the bloodstream.

""Soluble fiber binds to extra LDL cholesterol in the body and disposes it in the form of waste,"" Al Bochi said. ""You can think of it as a type of sponge.""

Studies have shown that eating less than a cup of legumes improved blood pressure , and a randomized controlled trial found that obese subjects who ate two servings a day of legumes and four servings of whole grains reduced their waist circumference, weight, triglycerides and blood pressure.

Legumes contain no cholesterol and are only about 3% fat (unless they are prepared with lard or other unhealthy fats). They are full of iron, manganese, copper, B vitamins, magnesium, zinc and phosphorous, and they are very low on the glycemic index, which means they have less effect on your blood sugar. They are also extremely high in protein; for example, a half-cup of some legumes has 8 grams of protein.

One caveat: Most people eat canned version of beans and other legumes, which will be packed with salt as a preservative. Salt, of course, can raise blood pressure.

""Make sure that you rinse the excess salt and water before consuming,"" Al Bochi said. ""And it's not just beans and lentils. Whether it's canned corn, canned peas, carrots, any type of canned food, it's important to remove the salt.""

Low-fat dairy

It may seem odd to include dairy in a list of top heart-healthy foods, but it turns out that milk, cheese and yogurt can help reduce blood pressure.

In a study by Boston University, researchers followed the eating habits of 75,000 people for up to 30 years and found that women who ate yogurt at least five times a week had a 20% reduction in their risk of developing high blood pressure. Milk and cheese also had an impact on lowering blood pressure, but it was nothing like yogurt, said the researchers.

Men in the study consumed much less yogurt than the women; the effect on their blood pressure was weaker.

""Dairy products contain calcium, potassium and magnesium, which are important minerals to help with blood pressure control,"" Al Bochi said.

Those in the study who benefited most also closely followed the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's DASH diet , which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. Its premise is simple: Eat more veggies, fruits and low-fat dairy foods while cutting way back on any food high in saturated fat, and limit your intake of salt.

The DASH meal plan includes three whole-grain products each day, four to six servings of vegetables, four to six servings of fruit, two to four servings of dairy products and several servings each of lean meats and nuts/seeds/legumes.

""You're getting the combination of benefits by consuming these foods because they do offer more than one heart-healthy nutrient,"" Drayer said.

In the Boston study, men and women who had a higher DASH score and who ate yogurt five or more times each week were 31% less likely to develop hypertension than participants who had low DASH scores and ate little yogurt.

Though the study didn't track the type of yogurt eaten, experts stress choosing low-fat versions.

""Dairy products can contain a high amount of saturated fat, so be sure to choose low-fat products,"" Al Bochi said. ""Saturated fat has been known to increase LDL cholesterol, the bad cholesterol that can cause heart disease.""

A low-sodium, balanced diet

No. 10 on the heart healthy list may seem odd, but it's important. Experts say that rather than focusing on just one or two of the heart healthy foods, you would be better served to eat a well-rounded diet that focuses on healthy foods of all types and colors.

""If you feel like there is a 'superfood' that you want to incorporate on a daily basis, say oats or salmon, that's OK,"" Drayer said, ""but I really feel that eating a variety of healthy foods is best, because you're getting a different nutrient package with each.

""The other thing I worry about is when people focus on one food, they may think that is their key to good health and eat more unhealthy foods,"" Drayer added. ""For example, some people say, 'I eat a lot of kale, so I'm healthy,' and they don't pay attention to the rest of their diet. No one food can undo damage from an unhealthy diet.""

Unless your doctor says otherwise, part of a heart-healthy diet is watching your salt intake. The hidden salt in many of our processed foods make it extremely difficult: It's estimated that Americans get up to 80% of the salt in their diet from processed foods. The American Heart Association has a list of some of the top offenders, called the ""Salty Six"": breads and rolls, cold cuts and cured meats, sandwiches, pizza, soup and chicken.

""Some ways to help reduce the amount of sodium in your diet is to limit the amount of processed foods, the amount of frozen dinners, for example, as well as adding salt to foods yourself,"" Al Bochi said. ""Consider using some herbs and spices as well as fresh lemon and vinegar to add some flavor to your meals.""

Finally, a heart-healthy diet should just be part of an overall heart-healthy plan that includes exercise, weight loss, stress reduction and not smoking.",10 best foods for your heart,http://cnn.com/2018/02/26/health/best-foods-for-heart/index.html

Misery in the largely Christian Philippines was compounded by the death of at least 37 people in a shopping mall fire, officials said on Christmas Eve.

The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons a year and warnings are routinely issued, but the level of destruction wreaked by this tropical storm — with winds of up to 75 mph, came as a surprise.

""It happened very fast, the flood waters quickly rose filling our house,"" farmer Felipe Ybarsabal, 65, told Reuters by telephone, saying he and his family had to run to higher ground.

""We weren't able to save anything from the house. There was no help from anyone because it was so fast,"" he added. ""Everything was two to three meters under water in less than an hour.""

Police and emergency officials said they expected the death toll to rise with more fatalities likely to be discovered in remote farm communities and coastal areas, as rescuers reached them and restored communication and power links.

Officials said 159 people were listed as missing while about 70,000 had been forced from their homes.

The storm was moving west on Sunday, over some outlying Philippine islands and the South China Sea toward southern Vietnam, at a speed of about 12 mph.

The southern region of the Philippines was hit by another disaster on the weekend when fire swept through a shopping mall in the city of Davao, killing mostly workers at a call center, city government officials said.

The vice mayor of Davao, Paolo Duterte, said the chance of survival for any of the 37 people missing at the NCCC Mall was ""zero.""

326,326,,nbcnews.com,"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

The deaths of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain this week have put fresh scrutiny on how the news media covers suicides — journalistic choices that mental health experts and researchers say could have life-or-death consequences for readers.

In recent years, public health studies have found an association between news reports about suicides, especially those of high-profile public figures, and an increase in suicide deaths. That troubling link has led many groups, including the World Health Organization, to suggest guidelines for reporting on people who take their own lives.

But some prominent voices in the media and medical professions want to go one step further, pressing for standardized rules — something akin to a journalistic Hippocratic Oath — that can be formalized in newsrooms across the country.

""If it's not institutionalized, we're going to see this up-and-down cycle"" where news editors and writers show varying degrees of sensitivity around suicide reporting, said Kelly McBride, the vice president of the Poynter Institute, an organization that teaches journalistic ethics and practices.

""In the same way [journalists] know not to libel people or know the rules around anonymous sources, best practices around covering suicides"" would be one more sacrosanct part of newsroom culture, McBride said.

McBride has worked closely for years with Dr. Dan Reidenberg, executive director of the suicide prevention organization Save.org, to help journalists find responsible ways to cover the issue. Reidenberg, who is also the lead author of the website ReportingonSuicide.org, has published guidelines drawn from scientific research.

The guidelines, among other recommendations, encourage journalists to avoid sensationalism and alarmism, refrain from specific detail about the manner of death, use neutral headlines (""John Doe, dead at 60""), draw attention to warning signs, investigate recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and generally offer hope.

McBride and Reidenberg both suggest that news outlets include phone numbers and links for suicide hotlines and treatment centers. (NBC News has included such information in its articles about Spade and Bourdain, and the network's News Standards division has issued reporting guidance.)

""There's a lot of room to grow for how media cover this in a way that reduces the risks of other deaths,"" Reidenberg said. ""But at the same time, there is more sensitivity and conscientiousness around this today because many people in newsrooms have been impacted personally by suicides.""

Reporting on suicides has long been a divisive practice in newsrooms, and some publications had a policy against covering them.

""In the old days, suicide was considered taboo to write about,"" said Meg Kissinger, a veteran investigative reporter for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel who is writing a book about suicide. ""But now, in an age when people are encouraged to talk openly about mental illness, newsrooms seem to be more open.""

Sensitive coverage of suicides is necessary to prevent suicide contagion — a phenomenon in which exposure to suicide through someone’s family, peer group, or through the media increases the odds of other people harming or killing themselves, said John Draper, the director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

“Whenever we lose somebody close to us to suicide, it affects us all greatly,” Draper said. “But even though we don’t know people like Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain personally, because of our familiarity with their products, their shows, we develop some type of relationship with them in some way, so it’s very personal.”

Without careful reporting, news of a suicide can disturb those who are already feeling vulnerable and hopeless, he added. “It can model for them how to deal with that hopelessness in the most negative and tragic way,” he said.

Tom Namako, the head of breaking news at Buzzfeed, said the newsroom staff ""thinks really deeply"" about how to cover suicides.

Buzzfeed journalists have a high bar for when to report on someone who has taken their own life, he said — and do so only if the person is a recognizable public figure or part of a wider national news story, such as online trolling and bullying.

Namako said the discussion of recent suicide coverage that circulated on social media was productive.

""We should be critiquing each other,"" Namako said.

327,327,,nbcnews.com,"Jimmy Miller remembers being called “half-breed” growing up.

Born in 1967 in the then South Vietnam capital of Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, Miller is the child of a Vietnamese mother and an American soldier. His parents were married, Miller said, but as the war pushed on, his father was injured and sent home. For Miller and other “Amerasians” like him, life in Vietnam was full of bullying, abuse and fear of the government, he recalled.

I grew up in Vietnam...I feel the hardships of everyone. That is why I want to get them out. How can we forget the brothers and sisters still struggling in Vietnam?

“When we grow up as Amerasian, people called us names,” Miller said. “Other kids throw rocks at us or beat us. And we don't have good education.”

So when Miller heard that the U.S. had passed laws at the end of 1987 to make it easier for Amerasians and their immediate family to come to the U.S., he applied immediately. In 1989, at the age of 22, he was granted permission to move to the U.S. by way of the Philippines. After six months there, Miller and his family settled in Spokane, Washington, in 1990.

“I felt very happy that I finally came to my fatherland,” Miller said. “I finally have my freedom. I finally have an opportunity for my future.”

Today, Miller works to help Amerasians in Vietnam come to the U.S. through Amerasians Without Borders, a nonprofit he created in 2015. The group ships DNA kits to those still in Vietnam, helps petition for them to immigrate to the U.S. should they have a positive match, and then helps resettle and support the immigrants when they arrive in Spokane.

Congress estimated that approximately 20,000 to 30,000 Amerasians and their family members lived in Vietnam in 1987, though by 1994 more than 75,000 had left the country to resettle in the U.S., according to a report by the U.S. General Accounting Office.

Miller said he has tested 500 people living in Vietnam and estimates that there are about 400 Amerasians left in the country.

Many, including Miller, came to the U.S. hoping to find their fathers, though the process can be difficult. While Miller came to the U.S. with his mother and siblings, all they had of their father was his name, a photograph, and a letter he’d written in 1969 with no return address.

“I spent years looking for my father,” Miller said. After sending a letter to the Red Cross and hearing back, Miller thought his father had died. But in 1995, Miller’s youngest sister Trinh wanted to get him a wedding gift that he would never forget.

At the time, she was volunteering at the Spokane Public Library. She asked a co-worker how she might find someone. “This was before the internet, so he told her if she had an address, you could call the library in that town, to see if they have them in their system,” Miller said.

While they did not have a return address on the letter Miller’s father had mailed, the letter did have a postmark from Fayetteville, North Carolina.

“She called the Fayetteville library and asked if they have a James Miller on file,” Miller said. There were three. “Then she asked if any of them have a middle initial ’A‘ for Arthur, and there was just one.”

Miller’s sister called the number on file, explained who she was, and left her brother’s contact information.

Miller’s father called him, but initially asked for Phan, the younger Miller’s Vietnamese name, mispronouncing it. “I thought, ‘oh well he is looking for the guy that used to live here, so I hang up,’” Jimmy Miller said.

About 15 minutes later, James Miller called back, and said he needed to talk to Jimmy, his son. “At first I was shocked, and I still did not believe it,” the younger Miller said. “I thought it was someone who had seen my story, and they were trying to trick me.”

Not long after, Jimmy Miller’s father and stepmother flew from North Carolina to Washington, to spend a month with him after 27 years apart.

Meeting his father inspired Miller to start his nonprofit.

“I grew up in Vietnam, and I feel the hardship. I feel the hardships of everyone,” Miller said. “That is why I want to get them out. How can we forget the brothers and sisters still struggling in Vietnam?""

The process to qualify under the 1987 law is more difficult now than it was when Miller came to the U.S., he said. To qualify for an Amerasian visa, one must include an application with a “detailed explanation,” including evidence. Many Amerasians lack any information who their parents are after being put up for adoption or being abandoned by their mothers out of fear of judgment or persecution, Miller said.

“It's impossible for some of these Amerasians to know who their dad are,” Miller said. “That's how I come up with the idea and said, ’how about we give them a DNA test?’ The DNA test will not lie.”

“DNA evidence between an Amerasian and their father, and even their half sibling, is the gold standard,” John Aloia, consular section chief of the U.S. Consulate in Ho Chi Minh City, said. “That's proof positive, and that eliminates any misunderstanding or that this child is theirs or not theirs.”

When organizing his nonprofit, Miller contacted Family Tree DNA, a Texas-based genetic testing company. The partnership with Family Tree DNA has allowed Miller to purchase the kits at a lower price compared to the roughly $300 a kit normally costs.

Miller thinks the group is close to testing every Amerasian left in Vietnam. The process has taken nearly five years and has stretched from Hue in Central Vietnam to the southern city of Ca Mau.

Since 2013, Miller has helped 15 families reconnect. “Every time I see a family connect, I feel the same. I am so happy for them, like finding my own family, my own dad,” said Miller. “Every time I see them I think of my dad.”

In the last year, Jimmy Miller has helped connect a family in Yakima, Washington, with their long lost daughter and sister in Tra Vinh, Vietnam. See their full story on Dateline, June 17, 2018, at 7/6c and on nbc.com/Dateline.

WICHITA, Kan. — A federal judge on Monday struck down a Kansas law requiring documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote, finding that such laws violate the constitutional right to vote. The ruling has national implications for voting rights.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson in Kansas City is the latest setback for Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who has championed such laws and led President Donald Trump's now-defunct voter fraud commission. The 118-page decision consolidated two cases challenging a Kansas voter registration law requiring people to provide documents such as a birth certificate, U.S. passport or naturalization papers.

The decision makes permanent an earlier injunction that had temporarily blocked the law.

No other state has been as aggressive as Kansas in imposing proof-of-citizenship voter registration requirements. Alabama and Georgia have proof-of-citizenship laws that are not currently being enforced, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Arizona is the only other state with a similar law in effect, but that law is far more lenient and allows people to satisfy it by writing their driver's license number on the voter registration form.

The lead case filed by the ACLU on behalf of several named voters and the League of Women Voters is centered on the National Voter Registration Act, commonly known as the Motor Voter Law, which allows people to register to vote when applying for a driver's license. The case required Kobach to prove that Kansas has a significant problem with noncitizens registering to vote.

But her ruling also encompassed a less-publicized legal challenge filed by Kansas voter Parker Bednasek, which is not limited to motor-voter applicants cited in the ACLU lawsuit and therefore encompasses all Kansas voters.

Kobach, a conservative Republican who is running for governor, was a leading source for Trump's unsubstantiated claim that millions of immigrants in the country illegally voted in the 2016 election.

The cases have drawn national attention because of its implications for voting rights as Republicans pursue laws they say are aimed at preventing voter fraud but critics contend target Democrat-leaning minorities and college students who may not have such documentation.

Kansas has about 1.8 million registered voters. Kobach has told the court that he has been able to document 127 noncitizens who at least tried to register to vote. Forty-three of them were successful in registering, he says, and 11 have voted since 2000. Five of those people registered at motor vehicle offices, according to Kobach.

In the first three years after the Kansas law went into effect in 2013, about one in seven voter registration applications in Kansas were blocked for lack of proof of citizenship — with nearly half of the would-be voters under the age of 30, according to court documents. From 2013 to 2016, more than 35,000 Kansans were unable to register to vote.

Courts had temporarily blocked Kobach from fully enforcing the Kansas law, with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver calling it ""a mass denial of a fundamental constitutional right.""",Judge strikes down Kansas law requiring proof of citizenship to vote,http://nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/judge-strikes-down-kansas-law-requiring-proof-citizenship-vote-n884516

Federal prosecutors in New York canceled a planned meeting with adult film star Stormy Daniels as part of their criminal investigation into President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, Daniels' attorney said late Sunday night.

Multiple people familiar with the matter had previously told NBC News that Daniels — whose real name is Stephanie Clifford — was scheduled to meet with the prosecutors Monday in Manhattan. But her attorney, Michael Avenatti, told NBC News that prosecutors from the office of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York told him that they were calling off the meeting, which he said had been scheduled for weeks, because the news media had found out about it and there would be cameras outside.

Avenatti said that he offered to hold the meeting at another location of prosecutors' choosing but that it hadn't been rescheduled.

""This is unheard of,"" he said separately on Twitter. ""We remain willing to cooperate but something isn't right ...""

Cohen, 51, hasn't been charged with any crimes. The FBI raided his office and hotel room in April and is believed to be seeking information about a $130,000 payment Cohen made to Daniels as part of a nondisclosure agreement related to an affair she has alleged to have had with Trump.

NBC News reported in April that Daniels is cooperating with federal investigators.

332,332,,www.nbcnews.com,"Jimmy Miller remembers being called “half-breed” growing up.

Born in 1967 in the then South Vietnam capital of Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, Miller is the child of a Vietnamese mother and an American soldier. His parents were married, Miller said, but as the war pushed on, his father was injured and sent home. For Miller and other “Amerasians” like him, life in Vietnam was full of bullying, abuse and fear of the government, he recalled.

I grew up in Vietnam...I feel the hardships of everyone. That is why I want to get them out. How can we forget the brothers and sisters still struggling in Vietnam?

“When we grow up as Amerasian, people called us names,” Miller said. “Other kids throw rocks at us or beat us. And we don't have good education.”

So when Miller heard that the U.S. had passed laws at the end of 1987 to make it easier for Amerasians and their immediate family to come to the U.S., he applied immediately. In 1989, at the age of 22, he was granted permission to move to the U.S. by way of the Philippines. After six months there, Miller and his family settled in Spokane, Washington, in 1990.

“I felt very happy that I finally came to my fatherland,” Miller said. “I finally have my freedom. I finally have an opportunity for my future.”

Today, Miller works to help Amerasians in Vietnam come to the U.S. through Amerasians Without Borders, a nonprofit he created in 2015. The group ships DNA kits to those still in Vietnam, helps petition for them to immigrate to the U.S. should they have a positive match, and then helps resettle and support the immigrants when they arrive in Spokane.

Congress estimated that approximately 20,000 to 30,000 Amerasians and their family members lived in Vietnam in 1987, though by 1994 more than 75,000 had left the country to resettle in the U.S., according to a report by the U.S. General Accounting Office.

Miller said he has tested 500 people living in Vietnam and estimates that there are about 400 Amerasians left in the country.

Many, including Miller, came to the U.S. hoping to find their fathers, though the process can be difficult. While Miller came to the U.S. with his mother and siblings, all they had of their father was his name, a photograph, and a letter he’d written in 1969 with no return address.

“I spent years looking for my father,” Miller said. After sending a letter to the Red Cross and hearing back, Miller thought his father had died. But in 1995, Miller’s youngest sister Trinh wanted to get him a wedding gift that he would never forget.

At the time, she was volunteering at the Spokane Public Library. She asked a co-worker how she might find someone. “This was before the internet, so he told her if she had an address, you could call the library in that town, to see if they have them in their system,” Miller said.

While they did not have a return address on the letter Miller’s father had mailed, the letter did have a postmark from Fayetteville, North Carolina.

“She called the Fayetteville library and asked if they have a James Miller on file,” Miller said. There were three. “Then she asked if any of them have a middle initial ’A‘ for Arthur, and there was just one.”

Miller’s sister called the number on file, explained who she was, and left her brother’s contact information.

Miller’s father called him, but initially asked for Phan, the younger Miller’s Vietnamese name, mispronouncing it. “I thought, ‘oh well he is looking for the guy that used to live here, so I hang up,’” Jimmy Miller said.

Carnahan posted on her personal Facebook page on Friday that some GOP leaders around the state have called her ""a stupid Asian not even born in America"" and used racial slurs, the Star Tribune reported. The newspaper also posted a screenshot of her post. In an interview Sunday with Minnesota-based TV station WCCO, Carnahan added that ""racism is not a partisan issue. Negative comments have come at me from both the left and the right.""

Carnahan was born in South Korea and adopted by Minnesota parents.

She told the Star Tribune that the remarks are ""starting to get to me,"" but declined to identify who attacked her. She said was merely venting on her personal page and thanking her father for his support after she reached out to him for advice.

Carnahan said on Facebook that she receives hate-filled email and social media messages on a daily basis. She wrote that she was confronted at President Donald Trump's rally in Duluth this past week, where she said she was told she is ""disgusting."" She said she has received emails telling her she is ""not worth a penny"" and should ""crawl back into a hole and stay there,"" and that she deserves to make less money than her male predecessors.

Democrats blame Trump for unleashing a new era of racial division. Carnahan, whose term ends next year, rejects that idea.

""I told (Trump) I want to run again to be chair because I want to deliver the state to you in 2020,"" Carnahan told the newspaper. ""If I thought he was a racist or that anything he did was stoking racial divisions, I wouldn't want to work on his behalf because I've had to deal with racism my entire life.""

Woody Allen said in a rare interview published Monday that he should be the ""poster boy"" of the ""MeToo"" movement because having worked with ""hundreds of actresses"" over five decades, not one has ever accused him of ""any kind of impropriety at all.""

Allen also again denied allegations by his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, that he had molested her as a child, a claim that has led some in Hollywood to shun the acclaimed director.

Allen's interview with the Argentine news program ""Periodismo Para Todos"" (Journalism for All) was first reported by the news website Quartz.

""I am a big advocate of the Me Too movement,"" Allen said in the interview. ""I feel when they find people who harass innocent women and men, it's a good thing that they're exposing them.""

In the interview, conducted in New York by journalist Jorge Lanata, Allen said he is a proponent of women's rights, having hired over 200 women crew members, created award-winning roles for women and paid them equally with men.

""I should be the poster boy for the MeToo Movement because I have worked in movies for 50 years and ... I worked with hundreds of actresses,"" Allen said.

He continued: ""I've worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one — big ones, famous ones, ones starting out — have ever, ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all. I've always had a wonderful record with them.""

Allen said he was also upset about being lumped in with men who have been accused by several women of seriously bad behavior.

He said the allegations from Dylan Farrow are different because they had been investigated and never substantiated.

""This is something that has been thoroughly looked at 25 years ago by all the authorities, and everybody came to the conclusion that it was untrue,"" Allen said. ""And that was the end, and I've gone on with my life. For it to come back now, it's a terrible thing to accuse a person of. I'm a man with a family and my own children, so of course it's upsetting.""

Last month, Allen's son Moses Farrow wrote a blog post defending his father against Dylan Farrow's allegations.

As the #MeToo Movement has gained steam, a growing number of actors have said they won't work with Allen again. Director and actress Greta Gerwig, who appeared in ""To Rome With Love,"" said in an online discussion with TV writer Aaron Sorkin that she regretted her decision to work with Allen.

MARONI, Cyprus — The salty water of the Mediterranean in plain view from Charis Christoforou’s olive farm is no help to the cracked, white earth suffering from a third year of drought.

A shortage of rain combined with clouds of dust carried over from the water-starved Middle East has slashed Christoforou’s olive production to a quarter of what it was less than two decades ago. Even cactuses are struggling to survive.

But there are few easy fixes as this island nation of almost 1.2 million people faces the looming reality of life without fresh water.

Cyprus and other countries in the eastern Mediterranean are increasingly vulnerable to drought as the changing climate brings higher temperatures and less precipitation, according to Petteri Taalas, the general secretary of the World Meteorological Organization.

Reservoirs behind dams are at just 21.9 percent of capacity across Cyprus.

The government here imposed restrictions on using water for irrigation this month. The move was unpopular with farmers, but officials say it is the only way to prevent the reservoirs from running dry before the end of the year.

Taps continue to flow in urban areas because of a supply of more costly potable water that has been transformed from seawater by four desalination facilities.

“This is not enough,” said Theodoulos Mesimeris, a climate-change expert with the country's environment ministry.

The semi-arid country is accustomed to periods of drought, but Mesimeris said the frequency of these dry conditions is expected to increase over the next decade. At the same time, demand for water has increased because of a growing urban population and booming tourism sector.

“The needs we have today, they are very different from the past,” he said. “It’s a difficult issue to handle.”

'I don't think they have a future'

Dead grass crunches beneath Christoforou’s feet as he walks through the farm he inherited from his father in 2015. Despite the challenges of a changing climate, he said he remains optimistic that the business will be sustainable.

The 34-year-old mechanical engineer said he’s trying everything to reduce his costs and keep up production.

He has access to public water, but it costs twice as much as pumping from his own boreholes. That's become an expensive necessity now that his wells have started drawing salt water as the Mediterranean leaches into the barren aquifers below.

To deal with the lack of rain, Christoforou said he’s stopped tilling the soil to lock in moisture, makes mulch out of the dead grass and twigs to diminish the sun’s rays, and uses natural traps to keep insects away.

In addition to dry conditions, extreme weather is also taking a toll. Christoforou’s attempts to grow grapes were dashed by rare hailstorms that hit the island in the first few days of June. The Ministry of Agriculture said that resulted in nearly 100 percent losses for some crops.

Charis Christoforou Petros Karadjias / for NBC News

Christoforou sees tourism as a potential revenue stream to support his struggling organic farm. He plans to build villas on the property where tourists can stay to taste his organic olive oil, honey and herbs and learn about sustainable farming practices.

But he’s less certain about the island's agriculture industry as a whole. Christoforou said he’s the only organic farmer in the area. Neighboring farms continue tilling their soil, increasing the risk for erosion when rains come in sudden sweeps.

“I don’t think they have a future,” he said. “If they don’t change their ways to be more eco-friendly, they will have problems.”

Desalination

Adriana Bruggeman, a professor of hydrology and water management at the Cyprus Institute, a research organization, said no matter what civilians do to conserve water, there is simply not enough of the natural resource to fill the need.

But most of the 3.65 million sun-seekers who visited the island last year — including 1.25 million from the United Kingdom — were most likely oblivious to the crisis.

“It’s nothing like Cape Town,” she said, referring to the South African city’s crisis this year, which forced residents to forgo regular showers and flushing toilets. “In the cities, for tourism, nobody will notice.”",Cyprus turns off taps to farmers as fresh water levels drop,http://nbcnews.com/news/world/cyprus-turns-taps-farmers-fresh-water-levels-drop-n881871

In the Grammy-nominated 1995 pop song “One of Us,” singer Joan Osborne posed a question for the ages: If God had a face, what would it look like?

Now, thanks to team of psychologists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, we may have an answer: To most Christians, he looks like a young white dude.

“From Michelangelo to Monty Python, popular illustrations have consistently shown God as an old and august white-bearded Caucasian man,” the researchers wrote in their study.

But when the psychologists had a sample of 511 Americans — 330 men, 181 women, 26 percent black, 74 percent Caucasian — look through hundreds of pairs of faces, the majority chose a much younger and much friendlier version of the Almighty.

“Together, these results help paint a picture of an American God who may not resemble scriptural or historical depictions,” the researchers wrote. “The face of the modern American God appeared kinder and more approachable than the God of the Sistine Chapel, perhaps reflecting different cultural concerns of the 16th century versus today.”

It’s still, however, a white face.

“People tend to believe in a God that looks like them,” Professor Kurt Gray, the study’s senior author, told NBC News. “And most of the people who took part were male and white.""

What surprised the researchers, however, was that most of the women thought the Almighty was male, and “even many black Americans saw God as white … and with twinkling eyes, “ said Gray.

“I think it’s because for millennia Christians have been led to think of God as male and white,” Gray said. “It’s changing a little now, but the church hierarchies are still mostly male and mostly white. In the Catholic Church, for example, the Pope is male and the priests are still only male.”

The participants were demographically diverse — 153 from the South, 143 from the Midwest, 124 from the Northeast, and 91 from the West, according to the study.

Politics also played a role in people’s perceptions of God, the researchers found.

Conservatives were more likely to see God as white and powerful. Liberals saw God as younger and loving.

“These biases might have stemmed from the type of societies that liberals and conservatives want,” Joshua Conrad Jackson, the study’s lead author, told the UNC website. “Past research shows that conservatives are more motivated than liberals to live in a well-ordered society, one that would be best regulated by a powerful God. On the other hand, liberals are more motivated to live in a tolerant society, which would be better regulated by a loving God.”

So there are variations to the face of God — even among adherents to the same religion.

“When believers think about God, they perceive a divine mind who is suited to meet their needs and who looks like them,” the researchers wrote. “Even though American Christians express belief in a universal God, their perceptions of his face are not universally similar.”","The face of God is in the eye of the beholder, researchers say",http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/face-god-eye-beholder-researchers-say-n882491

The doctor gave her two options to manage the miscarriage, she said: She could have a surgical procedure, or she could take medication.

Arteaga decided to get the prescription. On Thursday evening, she and her son picked up some photos from the drugstore and then headed to the pharmacy for her medication, she said.

""I thought it was going to be regular: running and getting what I need, and we're going to be out of there,"" Arteaga told NBC News. ""It didn't turn out that way. I was very shocked and couldn't believe what was happening.""

Arteaga said the pharmacist asked her whether she was pregnant and then informed her that he wouldn't be giving her the medication. When Arteaga asked why, he replied that it was because of his ""ethics,"" she said.

The only thing I could process in that moment was I didn't have control over my baby not being able to live inside of me, and I don't have control over how to miscarry.""

""I felt so helpless, and I felt so out of control of my own body. The only thing I could process in that moment was I didn't have control over my baby not being able to live inside of me, and I don't have control over how to miscarry,"" she said.

Confused, Arteaga thought that if she explained what was going on, the pharmacist would change his mind. With her 7-year-old son beside her and a long line of customers waiting, Arteaga said she tried to discreetly tell the pharmacist that ""the doctor prescribed it because the baby is not developing and the baby's not alive.""

But the pharmacist still said no, she said. Finally, he offered to transfer the prescription to another pharmacy. Arteaga eventually picked it up at another Walgreens in Peoria the next day.

Walgreens confirmed the incident to NBC News and said in a statement that it has a policy that allows pharmacists to step away from filling a prescription for which they have a moral objection.

But it said: ""It's important to note in that situation, the pharmacist also is required to refer the prescription to another pharmacist or manager on duty to meet the patient's needs in a timely manner.""

Walgreens said the policy applies to all of its pharmacies across the country. But state laws on pharmacies vary: Six states, including Arizona, have laws or regulations that allow pharmacists to refuse to dispense medication for religious or moral reasons, according to the National Women's Law Center.

Eight other states explicitly require pharmacists to provide medication to patients even if there are objections, and seven others allow pharmacists to refuse but prohibit them from obstructing access to the medication, the National Women's Law Center says.

Arteaga said she has no problem with the pharmacist's having beliefs different from hers, but she said she wished that one of the two other pharmacists working behind the counter could have dispensed her medication instead of making her go to another pharmacy.

""I could have just, right now, been dealing with me and my family and the loss of our baby,"" she said.

Walgreens said it would be providing additional training to all of its pharmacists on how to appropriately handle such situations. The company also said that it reached out to Arteaga, but she said the only contact she has had with Walgreens since the incident was when she spoke to the store's manager the following day to complain. The manager said she would look into it but never got back to her, Arteaga said.

Since Arteaga shared her story, other women who have had similar experiences have reached out, she said.

343,343,,nbcnews.com,"The tit-for-tat conflict between the United States and China — the world's two largest economies — is poised to escalate from there. The rhetoric is already intensifying.

""We oppose the act of extreme pressure and blackmail by swinging the big stick of trade protectionism,"" a spokesman for China's Commerce Ministry said Thursday. ""The U.S. is abusing the tariff methods and starting trade wars all around the world.""

Cecilia Malmstrom, the E.U.'s trade commissioner, acknowledged that the bloc had targeted some iconic American imports for tariffs, like Harley-Davidson motorcycles and bourbon, to ""make noise"" and put pressure on U.S. leaders.

John Murphy, a senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, estimates that $75 billion in U.S. products will be subject to new foreign tariffs by the end of the first week of July.

""We've never seen anything like this,"" said Mary Lovely, a Syracuse University economist who studies international trade — at least not since countries tried to wall themselves off from foreign competition during the Great Depression.

As painful as the brewing trade war could prove, many have seen it coming.

Trump ran for the presidency on a vow to topple seven decades of American policy that had favored ever-freer trade among nations. He charged that a succession of poorly negotiated accords — including the North American Free Trade Agreement and the pact that admitted China into the World Trade Organization — put American manufacturers at an unfair disadvantage and destroyed millions of U.S. factory jobs.

He pledged to impose tariffs on imports from countries that Trump said had exploited the United States. Late last month, Trump proceeded to infuriate U.S. allies — from the EU to Canada and Mexico by imposing tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum. The president justified the move by saying imported metals threatened America's national security — a dubious justification that countries have used rarely because it can be so easily abused.

And he is threatening to impose another national security-based tariff on imports of cars, trucks and auto parts.

Trump has also started a trade fight with China over Beijing's sharp-elbowed efforts to overtake U.S. technological dominance. China's tactics range from forcing American companies to hand over technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market to outright cyber-theft.

The White House last week announced plans to slap 25 percent tariffs on 1,100 Chinese goods, worth $50 billion in imports. Trump would start July 6 by taxing $34 billion worth of products and later add tariffs on an additional $16 billion in goods.

The Chinese have said they will respond in kind. Trump said he would then retaliate against any counterpunch from Beijing by targeting an additional $200 billion in Chinese products, and then yet another $200 billion if China refused to back down. All told, the $450 billion in potential tariffs would cover nearly 90 percent of goods China sends to the United States.

The tariffs and threats have begun to take a toll. Steel and aluminum prices, for example, have shot up and supplies have become scarce.","Trump jabbed first, and now world hits back in trade fight",http://nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-jabbed-first-now-world-hits-back-trade-fight-n885636

WASHINGTON — Paul Manafort was locked up in a Virginia jail Friday night after a federal judge revoked his bail amid allegations of witness tampering.

An inmate database showed that President Donald Trump's former campaign chief was booked into the Northern Neck Regional Jail in Warsaw, Va., at 8:22 p.m. Jail records listed his housing unit as ""VIP-1.""

He was taken to the 500-bed facility hours after prosecutors working for Special Counsel Robert Mueller convinced Judge Amy Berman Jackson that Manafort couldn't be trusted on house arrest any longer.

""I cannot turn a blind eye to this,"" Jackson said during a Friday morning hearing in her Washington courtroom.

She explained that she could not just release Manafort with more restrictions after he was charged with obstruction for reaching out to potential witnesses in his case.

""This isn’t middle school, I can’t take your phone,"" Jackson said.

Manafort, 69, did not appear to react to Jackson's ruling beyond a nod to his attorney. He gave a quick wave to his wife as he was taken into custody and led out of the courtroom.

He will remain in pretrial detention until a trial in September on charges stemming from his business dealings, including conspiracy and money laundering; he also faces a separate trial in Virginia.

The move drastically ratchets up pressure on Manafort as Mueller continues to investigate whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Manafort's ex-business partner, Rick Gates, who was indicted with him in October, has already pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate.

After Jackson's ruling, Trump tweeted that Manafort got a ""tough sentence"" — though he hasn't actually been sentenced for anything — and tried to downplay his involvement with the campaign.

""Like Manafort has nothing to do with our campaign,"" the president told reporters at the White House before the hearing.

""You know, Paul Manafort worked for me for a very short period of time. He worked for Ronald Reagan. He worked for Bob Dole. He worked for John McCain, or his firm did. He worked for many other Republicans. He worked for me, what, 49 days or something. Very short period of time.""

In fact, Manafort worked for the Trump campaign for 144 days. He joined the campaign in March 2016, became chair in May and resigned in August 2016.

Before Friday, Manafort had been largely confined to his home, tethered to two GPS ankle monitors while awaiting a trial set for the early fall.

But prosecutors made a new bid to toss him behind bars after uncovering evidence that allegedly shows that he and a Russian associate, Konstantin Kilimnik, used encrypted messages to reach out to two witnesses.

Mueller's team said Manafort wanted the witnesses to back up his claim that prominent Europeans he hired didn't lobby for Ukraine in the U.S., which would be illegal. One of the witnesses felt it was an attempt to ""suborn perjury,"" prosecutors said.

In court filings, defense lawyers accused Mueller's office of ""heavy-handed gamesmanship"" and argued text messages and an 84-second phone call were ""the thinnest of evidence,"" but they failed to persuade Jackson.

Ruling from the bench, she said she was not revoking Manafort's bail as punishment but because his attempts to contact witnesses constituted a danger to the court's integrity.

""I have no appetite for this,"" she said.

345,345,,nbcnews.com,"Chile's Catholic Church had already begun losing relevance when in 2010 it was found to have covered up for a prominent and powerful priest who sexually abused minors in his posh Santiago parish over decades. The Vatican eventually sanctioned the priest, the Rev. Fernando Karadima, in 2011, but the church has yet to recover from the scandal.

Many Chileans are still furious over Francis' 2015 decision to appoint a bishop who had been the priest's protege. Bishop Juan Barros of the southern city of Osorno has always denied he knew what Karadima was doing, but many Chileans have a hard time believing that.

""Sex abuse is Pope Francis' weakest spot in terms of his credibility,"" Massimo Faggioli, a Vatican expert and theology professor at Villanova University in Philadelphia, said ahead of the visit. ""It is surprising that the pope and his entourage don't understand that they need to be more forthcoming on this issue.""

The Karadima scandal and a long cover-up has caused a crisis for the church in Chile, with a recent Latinbarometro survey saying the case was responsible for a significant drop in the number of Chileans who call themselves Catholic as well as a fall in confidence in the church as an institution.

That distrust extends to Francis, who is making his first visit as pope to this country of 17 million people. The Argentine pope is nearly a native son, having studied in Chile during his Jesuit novitiate and he knows the country well, but Chileans give him the lowest approval rating among the 18 Latin American nations in the survey.

""People are leaving the church because they don't find a protective space there,"" said Juan Carlos Claret, spokesman for a group of church members in Osorno that has opposed Barros' appointment as bishop. ""The pastors are eating the flock.""

Some groups have called for demonstrations against the pontiff.

Victor Hugo Robles, an activist in Chile's lesbian and gay community, said the Vatican tries to paint an image of the pope as being close to the people, particularly those with the most needs.

""We are the ones who need help,"" said Robles. ""Gay people, people living with AIDS. When it comes to those things, the church has an attitude of intolerance, of disgust.""

Felipe Morales, from a group called the Workers' Socialist Front, said many were unhappy with the pope and the church's historical influence in Chile. They planned to protest outside while Francis celebrated Mass.

""The role of the church has been nefarious,"" said Morales. ""Sex abuse cases have been covered up and people are unhappy with many other issues.""

To be sure, many are excited to see the pope.

346,346,,nbcnews.com,"‘WE NEED MORE STORIES’

“Yappie” is “not that complicated,” Wang says when asked to describe the series. It’s a show about a young man navigating life and understanding the ways being Asian has affected him growing up, whether he realized it or not.

It was an idea Wang had for years as headlines about the lack of Asian-American representation on screen grew, but the challenges of getting it made became the center of frustration.

“When I was going around pitching this show, I met with a lot of big production companies. I explained how ‘Yappie’ is a look at the modern Asian-American experience and how our social issues and identities intersect with our lives. A lot of the feedback I was getting was, ‘Why? What’s the hook?’ And I’m like, ‘That is the hook!’” he said.

It’s a struggle that isn’t unique to a channel like Wong Fu, who is often seen as being pioneers of the platform and trailblazers for other Asian-American creators.

“YouTube is a place where Asian Americans have done well and have established audiences, but for some reason that hasn’t given Hollywood enough evidence or proof that they can go ahead and start a whole series with Wong Fu or Ryan Higa,” said Nancy Wang Yuen, a Biola University associate professor and one of the authors of a study that examined Asian American and Pacific Islander representation on television. “We need more stories about Asians going through life, just trying to live life as Asian Americans and dealing with the racism they experience and that are happening to people who have been here for generations.”

For “Yappie,” Wang scaled his initial pitch back, focusing instead on just creating the show instead of trying to get a studio or a brand to bite. The series ended up being self-funded, which includes funds from Wong Fu’s Patreon supporters, and Wang hopes the five episodes they could afford to make are enough to spark interest in a second season.

“This is the first time where we’re getting out of our comfort zone to try things we haven’t done before, which is talking about issues, talking about things that are more personal,” he said.

But he knows “Yappie” won’t be able to address all of the issues — or the criticism about Wong Fu in general that has led Wang to come out swinging on Twitter in response to what he says are accusations of “white-worshipping.""

Some of the criticism was focused on an Instagram promo that showed a Caucasian actor in the middle of the frame (the series’ cast is largely Asian American, and Wang explained the photo is a still image from the series that’s been misinterpreted); others in the YouTube comments for the trailer pointed out the lack of diversity in Wong Fu’s depiction of Asian Americans as being primarily of East Asian descent.

“I do feel the responsibility,” Wang said. “It is frustrating, but I don’t blame them because there is so little content out there.”

That criticism is one he actively thinks about, but he knows Wong Fu can’t take it on alone. “I honestly wish we can write a story for every person that’s out there,” he said. “My response when I hear this — and I don’t mean this in an arrogant way — is: you should go make this yourself. Figure out a way that you can have that outlet and put up that content that you want to see. People have this idea that since Wong Fu tells so many stories, we should tell all stories, but we aren’t an ABC or NBC. People think we have all these shows, but we can only afford to make one a year that’s only five episodes.”

THE NEXT PAGE

Wang acknowledges he’s still learning, and ""Yappie"" is reflective of that growth. He describes his character, Andrew, as being “basic,” and says the series is meant to show the process of Andrew — and the audience watching — waking up and caring about his community.

“Andrew is me if Wong Fu never happened,” Wang said about realizing who the main character was. “As soon as that clicked, I said, ‘Oh my God,’ because I never allowed myself to think of my story or my voice as special. In the show, I want to portray this character’s development. I want to make this relevant to people who know what it’s like to fade out in the background. I want to empower them to ask, ‘Well, what makes me me?’”

The culture has changed and we weren’t part of that, but I’m glad because we stayed focused to use it as a platform to tell our stories.

And that’s a journey that may end up taking place outside of YouTube someday as the platform continues to change. The video trends that have catapulted other creators to the top in shorter amounts of time don’t necessarily interest Wang, which contributes to his perspective that Wong Fu still has a way to go.

“YouTube became so big so fast that kids now see this as a challenge to get into it, just like how I used to see it as a challenge to get into Hollywood,” he said. “We could do the clickbait, easy turnaround, fast casual videos, but the things that will progress our community are films, shows, and stories that will change the way people see us.”

It’s one of the reasons he hopes audiences will give “Yappie” a chance, particularly at a time when the mainstream media has begun catching on to the need for Asian-American representation in Hollywood.

“We don’t have one common struggle, one common mission. ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ — not my narrative, but it’s going to enable another movie. ‘Master of None’ — not my narrative, but it empowered me to make my version,” Wang said. “I hope someone sees ‘Yappie’ and says, ‘That’s cool, but I’m going to tell my southern Vietnamese story growing up around all Hispanic people,’ or whatever your story is.”

President Donald Trump cannot block Twitter users for the political views they have expressed, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled on Wednesday.

Blocking users from viewing his Twitter account — a feature offered by the social media platform — is unconstitutional and a violation of the First Amendment, Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald wrote in her ruling.

""While we must recognize, and are sensitive to, the President’s personal First Amendment rights, he cannot exercise those rights in a way that infringes the corresponding First Amendment rights of those who have criticized him,"" Buchwald wrote.

The government had argued that blocked individuals could still access the president’s tweets. The judge agreed but said that even considering the president's First Amendment rights, preventing users from interacting directly with him on Twitter represented a violation of a ""real, albeit narrow, slice of speech.""

The case had been brought by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.

It argued that the @realDonaldTrump Twitter account is a ""public forum"" under the First Amendment.","Trump can't block users from his Twitter feed, federal judge rules",http://nbcnews.com/news/all/trump-can-t-block-users-his-twitter-feed-federal-judge-n876831
349,349,,nbcnews.com,"One result of China's new policies: The disposal and recycling giant Republic Services now sends 2,000 tons of recyclable paper a month to the dump.

Last week, researchers reported on the impact of China's policy changes in the journal Science Advances. The researchers studied 28 years of data from the United Nations' Comtrade database to measure exports of plastics to China, which processed much of the waste and turned it into new products. Projecting the rate of processing into the future, they estimated that, over the next dozen years, 111 million metric tons of waste will no longer find an afterlife in China.

""This is a wake-up call,"" said Amy Brooks, the lead author of the report and an engineering doctoral student at the University of Georgia. ""Historically, we've been depending on China to take in this recycled waste, and now they are saying 'No.' That waste has to be managed, and we have to manage it properly.""

Even with the world's efforts to recycle plastic — especially single-use items like bags, bottles and straws — only about 9 percent gets repurposed, while most ends up in landfills or contaminates the oceans, according to the researchers.

China first signaled that it no longer wanted to be the dumping ground for the world's synthetic garbage in 2013, when it enacted a temporary restriction and required markedly less contamination in the plastic shipments it allows into the country. The so-called Green Fence policy was a forerunner of the permanent ban that went into effect at the end of 2017, driven by China's concerns about the long-term environmental impact of its being the world's waste depot.","With China saying no to plastic waste, the world needs a new plan",http://nbcnews.com/news/world/china-saying-no-plastic-waste-world-needs-new-plan-n885946
350,350,,nbcnews.com,"The U.N. Human Rights Office in Mexico documented the disappearance of 21 men and two women in Nuevo Laredo from February until May 16, but local human rights organizations said there have been at least 40 disappearances in this period.

“Many of these people are reported to have been arbitrarily detained and disappeared while going about their daily lives,” Zeid said.

A series of testimonies received at the the U.N. human rights office suggest that people currently missing were reportedly detained by uniformed personnel as they walked or drove along public roads, and several burnt out and bullet-ridden vehicles were found by the roadside, the statement said.

""It is particularly horrific that at least five of the victims are minors, with three of them as young as 14. These crimes, perpetrated over four months in a single municipality, are outrageous,” said Zeid.

The U.N. report is the latest finding by international groups highlighting alleged abuses by the government in its decadelong battle against criminal gangs.

More than 35,000 people have gone missing since President Felipe Calderón sent military forces to battle drug gangs in late 2006.

There have been more than 200,000 murders since then, with a record number last year fueling widespread anger with President Enrique Peña Nieto’s ruling party ahead of a July 1 presidential election.

Mexican authorities had ample information and evidence about the Nuevo Laredo disappearances but had made little progress in investigating — leaving the burden of the search to the family and friends of some of the people missing, the U.N. noted.

""Families have undertaken their own searches, without any protection, and relatives have to date found the bodies of at least six victims. Several witnesses have been subjected to threats, and one was disappeared for two days,"" the statement read.

Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission, better known by their Spanish acronym CNDH, released a statement on Wednesday saying they initiated an investigation looking into the disappearances and described efforts such as asking the Navy and other officials to protect the population of Tamaulipas, the Mexican state where Nuevo Laredo is, though at least three disappearances had happened since then.

While CNDH's statement detailed steps the government was taking, it didn't include any findings or potential leads that could possibly give families of the victims some closure.

JERUSALEM — Prince William started his busy Israel tour Tuesday with a visit to Jerusalem's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.

William arrived Monday night in the first-ever official visit by a member of the British royal family to the tumultuous region London once ruled.

The Duke is set to meet two survivors who escaped Nazi Germany for the safety of Britain. The memorial has recognized Prince William's great-grandmother, Princess Alice, as part of the Righteous Among the Nations for her role in rescuing Jews during the Holocaust.

Yad Vashem said Princess Alice ""hid the three members of the Cohen family — Rachel, Tilda and Michelle — in her palace in Athens during the Nazi occupation of Greece.""

It said: ""Princess Alice personally saw to it that the members of the persecuted Jewish family had everything they needed, and even visited them in their hiding place, spending many hours in their company.""

Thanks to her, the Cohen family survived and today lives in France, it said.

The princess died in 1969 and in 1988 her remains were brought to Jerusalem.

In a private 1994 visit to Yad Vashem, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, planted a tree there in his mother's honor.

Yad Vashem Chairman Avner Shalev is guiding Prince William through the memorial's exhibitions detailing the death of 6 million Jews systematically killed by Nazi Germany and its collaborators during World War II.

Though the trip is being billed as non-political, and places a special emphasis on technology and joint Israeli-Arab projects, William will also be meeting with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and visiting landmark Jerusalem sites at the heart of the century-old conflict.

Three decades of British rule between the two world wars helped establish some of the fault lines of today's Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Britain's withdrawal in 1948 led to the eventual establishment of Israel and Jordan.

Britain has since taken a back seat to the United States in mediating peace efforts, and the royal family has mostly steered clear of the region's toxic politics.

For the 36-year-old William, second in line to the throne, it marks a high-profile visit that could burnish his international credentials.",Britain's Prince William starts Israel visit by honoring Holocaust victims,http://nbcnews.com/news/world/britain-s-prince-william-starts-israel-visit-honoring-holocaust-victims-n886516

Doctors discovered the tumor early during a routine screening, the statement said.

“His surgeons are confident that the surgery was a success and that the prognosis for his recovery is good,” the statement said. “He will undergo chemotherapy as the next step in his treatment.”

The surgery was done at Johns Hopkins’ specialized pancreatic cancer clinic.

Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has been battling brain cancer since doctors found a tumor last year, wished Reid well in a tweet on Monday.

Reid did not run for re-election in 2016.

In an interview with NBC News last month, Reid — who has remained relatively silent in retirement — waded back into national politics, warning his party not to pursue the impeachment of President Donald Trump.

The white woman who appeared to call police on an 8-year-old black girl selling water in San Francisco said Monday that she has received an onslaught of hate mail and death threats since a video of the confrontation went viral, adding that her actions were never racially motivated.

Alison Ettel, dubbed ""Permit Patty"" on social media, was attacked online after video of her trying to hide while she was on the phone gained more than 1 million views after it was posted Saturday on Instagram.

Erin Austin, the mother of the 8-year-old girl, Jordan Rodgers, said her daughter was selling bottles of water in front of their home in an attempt to raise money because Austin recently lost her job. Jordan also wanted to get enough to pay for a trip to Disneyland.

It's unclear what happened prior to the video, but in the short clip, Austin follows Ettel as the woman presses a phone to her ear and walks away.

""This woman don't want a little girl to sell some water. She's calling police on an 8-year-old little girl,"" Austin says in the video as Ettel ducks behind a wall and out of sight. ""You can hide all you want — the whole world is going to see you boo.""

But Ettel said the video tells only part of the story: She was working with her windows open on a hot day, while Austin and Rodgers shouted as they tried to sell water.

""I tried to be polite but I was stern,"" Ettel told ""Today"" in an exclusive television interview. ""And I said, 'Please, I'm trying to work. You're screaming. You're yelling, and people have open windows. It's a hot day. Can you please keep it down?'""

Austin denied Ettel was diplomatic in her approach.

""She never asked us to be quiet. She came out and directly demanded to see a permit to sell water from an 8-year-old,"" Austin said.

In an interview with HuffPost, Ettel said she didn't actually call the police and was only bluffing. Robert Ruecam, a spokesman for the San Francisco Police Department, confirmed to NBC News that no complaint was made regarding the incident.

The video is reminiscent of a recent viral clip in which a white woman in Oakland, California, called the police on black men having a barbecue in a park. That woman was named ""BBQ Becky"" online.

Since the San Francisco video went viral, Ettel said she's received ""all kinds of threats. Horrible, horrible images and death threats. All for something that was an escalated miscommunication between two neighbors.""

Meanwhile, following the outrage, one Twitter user purchased four Disneyland tickets for Jordan, her family said.

In a 2014 New York Times essay, Roth wrote that, 45 years later, he was ""shocked that I could have been so reckless, pleased that I was so reckless.""

""I certainly didn't understand while at work that henceforth I was never to be free of this psychoanalytic patient I was calling Alexander Portnoy,"" he wrote.

President Barack Obama presents the National Humanities Medal to Philip Roth at the White House in March 2011. Jim Watson / AFP - Getty Images file

He described his goal this way:

""Impatient with the virtues of logical progression, I wanted to renounce the orderly, coherent development of an imagined world and to advance helter-skelter, in a frenzy, as the classic analytic patient ideally proceeds in the throes of associative freedom.

""I portrayed a man who is the repository of every unacceptable thought, a 33-year-old man possessed by dangerous sensations, nasty opinions, savage grievances, sinister feelings and, of course, one stalked by the implacable presence of lust. In short, I wrote about the quotient of the unsocialized that is rooted in almost everyone and addressed by each with varying degrees of success.""

Roth was born and raised in Newark, New Jersey, the second child of first-generation American Jews from the historical Eastern European region of Galicia, or what is now Poland and Ukraine.

He hit the ground running, publishing ""Goodbye, Columbus and Five Short Stories,"" his first book, in 1960. It won the National Book Award, and for the rest of is life, much of his literature tackled head-on the thorny questions of Jewish status and identity in American culture against the turbulent backdrops of the 1960s and the 1970s.

In a style that can be likened to Woody Allen's darker existential movies, his works were often funny, but they weren't comedies, barring the occasional satire like ""Our Gang,"" a surreal sendup of the Nixon administration. It was published in 1971 — before the world even learned of the corruption of Watergate.

For decades, Roth was associated with The New Yorker, which first published him in 1958. In consecutive issues in 1979, the magazine published the full text of his novel ""The Ghost Writer,"" which introduced the character of Nathan Zuckerman, in whose voice he would go on to write many of his best-known later works.

""Few novelists have been as dogged by personal interrogations as Roth, or as publicly distressed by them,"" the critic Nathaniel Rich wrote in The New York Review of Books in March.

Rich took note of the dual antagonism and respect with which many intellectual American Jews regarded him, whose laying bare of the disillusionment with the American Dream held by a particular subset of Jewish intelligentsia was close enough to the bone to be both true and nettlesome.

But Rich concluded that Roth's idiosyncratic point of view was needed now more than ever before.

""Readers and critics, distraught at the nihilism of the current political nightmare, have sought comfort in fiction that affirms their principles and beliefs, fiction in which victimized peoples rise triumphant,"" he wrote in March.

""They desire a new Exodus, new Leon Urises. And they will get them. But we should hope for something more. We should hope for new Philip Roths.""

360,360,,www.nbcnews.com,"While President Donald Trump lauded America’s military might at the White House on Thursday, a group of lawmakers outside the Capitol chastised him for weakening the Armed Forces by deporting veterans and their families.

Trump kicked off the annual Wounded Warrior Project Soldier Ride by speaking of the $716 million more he is requesting for the military in the 2019 budget. With that money, “our nation can defeat any hardship, meet any challenge, beat any setback and rise from our trials stronger and more determined by far, by far, than ever before,” Trump said.

He referred to the vets on stage with him as ""winners.""

""This is not a stage of those who gave in,"" he said. ""They don’t know what those words mean.""

But outside the Capitol, Estela Juarez, 8, the daughter of a decorated former Marine sergeant, Cuauhtemoc “Temo” Juarez, pleaded for Trump to stop the hardship that her family is facing — the scheduled June 21 deportation of her mother, Alejandra, Juarez's wife.

“I ask President Trump to please let my mom stay because she is a great mom and I don’t understand why we have to leave her,” the young girl — who could barely reach the microphones — said, her words turning to cries. “She has been there every day of my life and I can’t imagine leaving her. Please, President Trump, I ask that you let her stay.”

Cuauhtemoc Juarez, a U.S. citizen, was an infantryman who served from 1995 to 1999 in the 1st Battalion and 8th Marine Regiment. He served in Albania, the Congo and South America, and was also deployed to Iraq in 2003 with the Florida Army National Guard, Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., said. He and others have requested a review of his case.

Alejandra Juarez entered the U.S. illegally in 1998. She has been checking in every six months with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to Soto’s office. She and her husband have been married since 2000. She said during the news conference that her husband had voted for Trump.

ICE spokesman Nestor Yglesias said Alejandra Juarez had claimed to be a U.S. citizen when she tried to enter the U.S. from Mexico on May 21, 1998. ICE issued her an ""expedited order of removal"". Then, two days later, she tried again to cross the border, saying she was a U.S. citizen, but withdrew her request.

Yglesias said she entered illegally successfully at some point later. ICE arrested her in August 2013 on immigration violations that it did not detail in its statement and informed her that her previous removal order was being reinstated. ICE released her on an order of supervision and granted stays of removal in August 2015 and August 2016.

""At this time, Juarez must comply with her final order of removal,"" Yglesias said.

Her attorney Stacey Bradbury said since illegally entering the country, Alejandra Juarez has been an ""upstanding member of society and raised a family"" and has helped make her husband's service to his country possible.

""When she married her husband, he was a military person and she maintained a home while he did his tour. Someone has to recognize this is what spouses do,"" Bradbury said. ""We want her to be fixed and taken care of, but (deportation) hurts the family. This husband sacrificed and committed himself to the country. The government calls, he's running ... he needs his family intact. You are a veteran for a moment. What if he gets called back? He needs someone to take care of his family.""

The Juarez family members are constituents of Soto, who has introduced legislation to prevent military spouses from being deported.

“To separate families who have contributed to our nation’s security is unacceptable,” Soto said. “This is just one of many military families who now find themselves at risk of deportation and being torn apart due to current policies of the current administration and their push for hardline deportation policies.”

At least 11,800 people now serving in the military have a spouse or family member facing deportation, according to data provided to Soto’s office by American Families United, a group that advocates for the families.

Bush and Barack Obama, officials allowed spouses of military personnel to “parole in place” — essentially remain in the country while they worked out their immigration status.",Trump lauds soldiers as military families plea for end to deportations,http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/trump-lauds-soldiers-military-families-plea-end-deportations-n869356?cid=par-bluestate_20180626

President Donald Trump's embattled personal attorney, Michael Cohen, retweeted a photo of himself with comedian Tom Arnold — who happens to be working on a show with Viceland that features him hunting for unflattering video of Trump.

Arnold told NBC News early Friday that Cohen ― who is under investigation by federal prosecutors ― talked to him about the show, which is expected to air later this year.

""We’ve been on the other side of the table and now we’re on the same side,"" said Arnold, an outspoken Trump critic.

""It's on! I hope he [Trump] sees the picture of me and Michael Cohen and it haunts his dreams.""

Cohen on Twitter Friday evening called the meeting ""a chance, public encounter in the hotel lobby where he asked for a selfie"" and he added: ""Not spending the weekend together, did not discuss being on his show nor did we discuss @POTUS,"" referring to Trump. Cohen added the hashtags #done and #ridiculous.

It was Arnold — who is Trump fan Roseanne Barr's ex-husband — who posted the photo Thursday night with the caption ""I Love New York."" Cohen then retweeted it without comment.

Thursday night, NBC News asked Cohen about the photo and he referred inquiries to Arnold. Several hours later, Arnold contacted NBC News.

He said he was in New York taping interviews for the Viceland show and that he and Cohen met at the Loews Regency Hotel in Manhattan. A Viceland producer said Cohen had not done an on-camera interview and they are ""still working it.'

Viceland announced in May that it had tapped Arnold to helm a show called ""The Hunt for the Trump Tapes,"" and investigate whether rumored tapes from the past showing the president in a negative light actually exist.

""The host will draw on his high-profile network of celebrity friends, entertainment executives, and crew members he's met over more than 35 years in showbiz to dig for evidence on Trump's most incriminating moments — and, being a comedian and all, he'll have a little fun along the way,"" Vice said in the announcement of the show.

""He'll be backed up by a handful of experienced journalists, and — aside from trying to uncover the tapes themselves — he'll look into the companies and tycoons who have allegedly fought to keep the damning recordings a secret.""

Arnold would not say whether Cohen was planning to give him any tapes he might have of conversations with Trump.

But he added, ""This dude has all the tapes — this dude has everything.""

""I say to Michael, 'Guess what? We’re taking Trump down together, and he’s so tired he’s like, 'OK,' and his wife is like, 'OK, f*** Trump,'"" Arnold said, laughing.

Later Friday, Arnold tweeted the photo again, seeking to emphasize that it was himself and not Cohen who suggested the takedown.

""Michael has enough Trump on his plate,"" Arnold said. ""I'm the crazy person who said Me & Michael Cohen were teaming up to take down Trump of course. I meant it.""

He told NBC News that tweeting the photo was ""indiscreet"" but said Cohen had been betrayed by Trump after years of loyal service.

""Michael Cohen showed up and worked diligently above and beyond and sacrificed and Donald Trump is like I don’t even know who he is. You think Michael doesn’t notice that?"" Arnold said.

Cohen is under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York for his business dealings, including a $130,000 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels, who claims she had sex with Trump. The White House says Trump denies the allegation.

The probe was launched based on a referral from special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible ties to the Trump campaign and who has secured indictment against other Trump allies.

Cohen, who has denied wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime, has already talked to congressional investigators. In October, he was questioned about a scuttled plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow and emails he received in 2015 from Felix Sater, a former Trump associate, about the real estate deal.

In May, Arnold tweeted a photo of himself with Sater.

Earlier this week, Cohen reportedly hired a new attorney, a former prosecutor for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, after a dispute with his first legal team over bills.","Tom Arnold tweets picture with Michael Cohen, says he 'has all the tapes'",http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-mugs-trump-critic-tom-arnold-n885611
364,364,,nbcnews.com,"When Erika L. Sánchez set out to write her first novel “I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter,” which is now a New York Times bestseller and a National Book Awards finalist, she did it with a certain reader in mind.

“It was important for me, for young people of color, to feel seen by the book,” Sánchez told NBC News about the novel, which focuses on a young woman, Julia, who has to grapple with grief following an accident involving her sister and her mother's comparisons about the two.

Born and raised in Cicero, Illinois, to Mexican immigrant parents who worked in a factory, Sánchez started writing poetry at a very early age as a way to cope with the world around her.

“It´s a strange thing for an immigrant child to want to be a poet,” said Sánchez, whose book of poetry, Lessons on Expulsion was a finalist for the PEN America Open Book Award earlier this year. “A lot of people don’t care about poetry or are afraid of it.”

Sánchez, an Arts Fellow teaching poetry at the prestigious Princeton University, confessed she was “a messed up kid;” though she was an avid reader, she didn't get excited about getting an education until she was in college. Julia, the character of her young adult novel, shares some of the traits she had as a teenager.

Sánchez said the character she created turned off some literary agents.

“I got rejected a lot by agents. Some of them didn’t like the voice,"" said Sánchez. ""My character is not for everybody, she’s a snarky brown girl, just as I was. A lot of agents didn’t understand that kind of person. There’s this idea that minorities are supposed to be model minorities. I think that is unfair.""

Shedding light on depression, especially among Latinas

Both Sánchez and Julia suffer from depression, which unfortunately still carries a stigma in so many communities. For this reason, she was determined to raise awareness about it through her literary work. “I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter” addresses the issue of suicide in young Latinas. Hispanic teens, especially females, have reported significantlyhigher rates of suicide attempts than white or black teens, according to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data.

“I think it’s important to talk about mental health. I’m tired of the stigma. People need to see it as a part of health in general. If you’re not mentally well, you’re not physically well. People think [depression] is a character flaw, when it’s a mental illness that needs treatment.”

Sánchez graduated Phi Beta Kappa and Magna Cum Laude from the University of Illinois at Chicago, and later received an MFA in Creative Writing from the University of New Mexico. Yet she warns against a one-size-fits-all mentality when it comes to college.

“I think college is amazing for those who want to attend,"" Sánchez said. ""I just think there are many ways to be intelligent. [Saying college is the only option for Latinos] denigrates people who don’t go to college and that’s not fair,” she said.

After Sánchez graduated college, she couldn't make a living as a writer. She had to get a regular job she didn't enjoy, and blogged about her struggles.

“I was coping with a 9-5 job after grad school, so I wrote a blog. The title was: Oh Hells Nah! It was a way to vent with my situation,"" said Sánchez. ""This certain producer started to follow and read my blog. She was in New York City, and asked if I’d ever written a novel or a screenplay. I hadn't. But thanks to that question, at 28, I started writing the novel. It ended up being published when I was 33.”

Her book of poetry took much longer. It was a 10-year journey that she saw through as she also wrote essays, columns and articles (including work for NBC Latino) because poetry is her favorite form of written expression.","In best-selling 'I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter,' Erika Sánchez hits crucial chord",http://nbcnews.com/news/latino/best-selling-i-am-not-your-perfect-mexican-daughter-erika-n869101

The newspaper also posted a screenshot of her post. In an interview Sunday with Minnesota-based TV station WCCO, Carnahan added that ""racism is not a partisan issue. Negative comments have come at me from both the left and the right.""

Carnahan was born in South Korea and adopted by Minnesota parents.

She told the Star Tribune that the remarks are ""starting to get to me,"" but declined to identify who attacked her. She said was merely venting on her personal page and thanking her father for his support after she reached out to him for advice.

Carnahan said on Facebook that she receives hate-filled email and social media messages on a daily basis. She wrote that she was confronted at President Donald Trump's rally in Duluth this past week, where she said she was told she is ""disgusting."" She said she has received emails telling her she is ""not worth a penny"" and should ""crawl back into a hole and stay there,"" and that she deserves to make less money than her male predecessors.

Democrats blame Trump for unleashing a new era of racial division. Carnahan, whose term ends next year, rejects that idea.

""I told (Trump) I want to run again to be chair because I want to deliver the state to you in 2020,"" Carnahan told the newspaper. ""If I thought he was a racist or that anything he did was stoking racial divisions, I wouldn't want to work on his behalf because I've had to deal with racism my entire life.""

An independent mayoral candidate was gunned down in the conflict-ridden rural town of Aguililla in the western state of Michoacan on Wednesday. Michoacan Gov. Silvano Aureoles vowed to catch those responsible for killing candidate Omar Gomez Lucatero.

Aguililla is an extensive but sparsely populated mountain township where drug gangs and vigilantes have been active.

And early Thursday, the mayoral candidate for the leftist Democratic Revolution Party was killed in Ocampo, also in Michoacan.

His party said issued a statement saying that Fernando Angeles Juarez was assassinated, and called on the government to provide protection for people running in the July 1 elections.

Ocampo is a rural township about 95 miles (150 kilometers) west of Mexico City best known for the Monarch butterfly wintering grounds that occupy part of the mountainous municipality. It also been plagued by illegal logging and gangs.

Almost all of the 18 candidates killed across the country so far have been running for local posts in the July 1 elections, which will also decide the presidency, governorships and Congress. Other politicians who were considering a run have been killed before they could even register as candidates. The killings have particularly hit states like Michoacan, Guerrero and Oaxaca.

SAN FRANCISCO — The California Supreme Court has ruled that Facebook and other social media companies must turn over user content that is public to criminal defendants.

The court on Thursday kicked the specific case back to the trial court to decide whether information requested by the defendants was open to the public - and, therefore, information that companies must provide.

Attorneys for the social media companies had argued that federal privacy law prevents the release of any user content and that the defendants had other ways to get the material.

The defendant also sought information from Twitter.

At issue are requests by a defendant accused in a San Francisco slaying who wants videos and other content posted to Facebook and Instagram by the victim and a witness. The defendant, Lee Sullivan, and a co-defendant, Derrick Hunter, also sought information from Twitter.

Prosecutors charged the two men with murder in an alleged gang-related drive-by-shooting in 2013. Sullivan said the witness was his former girlfriend, and her social media posts would show she was jealous and angry because Sullivan was involved with other women.","Social media companies must hand over public content to criminal defendants, court says",http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-high-court-rule-social-media-access-criminal-defendants-n877016
371,371,,www.nbcnews.com,"When designer Alexander Wang released his latest collection, his goal was to not just tell his family’s immigration story, but also to change how the fashion industry sold clothes.

I wanted to take the idea of my roots and put it into all these things — a singular narrative that felt very much true to who I am today.

So Wang did something unconventional: He hosted a show on June 3 — three months ahead of the next scheduled New York Fashion Week, which take place in February and September each year.

He also rebranded his company’s logo and called his new release “Collection 1” instead of the typical “spring/summer” or “fall/winter.”

“It’s not a time of tradition, but innovation,” Wang said. “Seasonality didn’t feel relevant in terms of titling a collection by a season or showing as a part of a fashion week that was labeled under a specific season.”

The designs from this collection, which Wang calls “immigrant Americana,” combined his parents’ immigrant experience with Wang’s upbringing in the U.S. Angela Weiss / AFP - Getty Images

Because his label’s peak sales are in June, Wang said it made sense to have a show that month and deliver the collection by the end of October. “Collection 2” is scheduled to have a show in December, he added, and that pattern is expected go on in years to come.

Wang said he knew there would be risk involved with leaving New York Fashion Week and showing at a time when editors and influencers who usually attend their shows might not be present. But he was confident he could put together something special.

“We felt with social media and the way information is communicated, we could make this experience something that is truly unique for everyone there and for people that were live streaming it,” Wang said. “I wanted it to feel like they were all sharing that moment together.”

To inspire his first collection outside traditional timing, Wang looked at his parents’ journey from China to the U.S. and how it was intertwined with his own experience.

Wang’s parents, older brother, and older sister first came to the States in 1973 but didn’t know a word of English, Wang said. They had come for his uncle’s wedding and decided to establish a life in the country.

Everything from going to the grocery store and figuring out how how to shop for food to learning how to look for a job was a new experience for them, Wang added.

“They took on many different occupations just to work their way into society, from being a construction worker to working at a laundromat to owning their own restaurant together to starting their own business in plastic manufacturing,” he said. “When they were getting settled, they brought in more family members, and then I was born 10 years later into a life that was different from their experience when they first came here.”

The designs from this collection, which Wang describes as “immigrant Americana,” combined his parents’ experience with Wang’s upbringing in the U.S., including references to Harley-Davidson motorcycles, rock ‘n’ roll, and football mixed with frog closures, Mandarin collars, and decorated surgical masks. The concept came from wanting to highlight his parents’ journey fused with his love for Americana music, which Wang said he listened to growing up.

As part of his research, Wang took a road trip to Santa Barbara from Los Angeles with his parents — who are divorced — and siblings last year.

It was the first time that he heard the story about his parents’ immigration.

“We hadn’t taken a trip with just immediate family in over 20 years, and it was the perfect opportunity and setting for me to really interview my parents on their story about how they first arrived,” Wang said. “It was so inspiring, but also new to me because, surprisingly, I had never asked them about it before.”

The June event was also the first time his father attended one of his fashion shows and the first time his family was all together for a collection showing, which Wang said made it even more symbolic.

He added that he feels blessed to have a platform where he’s able to share his story as an American with immigrant roots as well as show his collection during a time when he feels change is important.

“I wanted to take the idea of my roots and put it into all these things — a singular narrative that felt very much true to who I am today,” Wang said.

“Hopefully this will be a move toward something that will help the industry think about how we approach seasons, collections and shipping things because it does need some revamping,"" he added. ""And it’s exciting to be a part of a time where we can do something different.”

BAGHDAD — Iraq's Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a disputed law ordering a hand recount of the ballots from last month's national elections after widespread allegations of fraud embarrassed political leaders and marred the initial result.

What was supposed to mark the start of a new era for Iraq has turned into a political crisis as the charges of vote tampering grew too loud for Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi's government to ignore.

The May 12 election was the first since Iraq declared victory over the Islamic State group, which was in control of one-third of Iraqi territory just three years ago. But the euphoria over that milestone was quickly overshadowed by the charges of voter irregularities that surfaced on the day of the election and grew louder in the weeks that followed.

Adding to the outcry was a suspicious fire days after Parliament ordered the recount that burned down a warehouse believed to contain some of the ballots cast by Baghdad voters.

The Interior Ministry said the June 10 blaze was confined to a storage unit holding the electronic machinery introduced in the election to speed up the vote count and protect against ballot stuffing, and insisted the ballots were secure. But eyewitness reports said some ballots were charred and others soaked as firefighters battled the blaze.

A hand recount of all 11 million ballots could take weeks, if not longer, and promises to delay the already sluggish process of forming a new government.

Still, the populist preacher Muqtada al-Sadr, who came in a surprise first place in the vote, called on his supporters to respect the recount ruling.

""I call on everyone to show restraint and deference to the law, even if they are not convinced by it,"" al-Sadr said in a statement.

Thursday's Supreme Court decision upheld a law ordering a recount passed by Parliament after the initial results showed that two-thirds of current lawmakers would lose their seats. The timing of the law's passage led President Fuad Masum and the national elections commission to charge lawmakers with political interference.

But the Supreme Court ruled that the legislation was broadly constitutional and endorsed an order to replace the Independent Elections Commission with a panel of nine judges to supervise a recount. The commission, disputing the fraud allegations, had refused to conduct one of its own.

However, the court rejected a measure invalidating all ballots cast abroad and by Iraqis displaced by recent conflict. Chief Justice Medhat al-Mahmoud said that sweeping measure was unjust to voters who cast legitimate ballots.

An estimated 3 million Iraqis live in displaced persons camps, and international groups urged authorities to take measures to ensure they could vote. Many were driven from their homes during battles against the Islamic State group, and are presumed to be overwhelmingly Sunni, reinforcing the perception that they are being marginalized by the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad.

Still, a hand recount is unlikely to dispel the fraud allegations.

Ahmad al-Abadi, a lawyer representing Parliament's case to the Supreme Court, said the recount would get the country ""70, 80, 90 percent"" of the way to having an untainted result, but that because of the Baghdad warehouse fire there would never be 100 percent certainty.

Outgoing Parliament Speaker Salim al-Jabouri called the fire arson, but authorities have not named any suspects in their investigation.

A recount is not likely to change the balance of power between the country's Shiite, Sunni, and Kurdish blocks, according to Bilal Wahab, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

""The majority of accusations of fraud were from within the communities, and not between them,"" Wahab said.

But issues like health care, jobs and the economy took a backseat on right-leaning outlets, as opposed to what was published by their left-leaning counterparts, which had a more even distribution of topics, the study found.

SEPARATING FACT FROM FICTION

The veracity of what’s being published through official WeChat accounts and private groups is a growing source of concern for some.

Just like Facebook and Twitter, WeChat can feature content that’s been distorted, exaggerated or just plain false.

One space where this can happen is in private groups. WeChat allows users to create a group chat of up to 500 members, according to the company.

“The groups are really where the articles are shared and where discussions take place,” Zhang said.

One example of misinformation cited in the study involved reports in November warning WeChat readers of an impending civil war and mass riots led by ""Antifa.""

Short for “anti-fascist,” Antifa is a loosely organized coalition of protesters, left-wing activists, and self-described anarchists who vow to physically confront ""fascists"" — meaning anyone who espouses bigoted or totalitarian views.

Following President Donald Trump’s election, Antifa protesters have occasionally clashed with his supporters and white nationalist groups at demonstrations across the country.

To be sure, an Antifa-led civil war or mass riots never happened. Moreover, a recent search on WeChat showed that some articles did in fact counter the erroneous claims and urged users not to spread unfounded reports.

But the story, translated into Chinese, nonetheless propagated far and wide on WeChat, according to the report.

If you look at discourse on WeChat, conservatives are winning the messaging game

“This case illustrates how a conspiratorial idea that was relayed all the way from the English-language far-right by way of partisan outlets on WeChat could be amplified through the replication and multiplication of diffuse outlets eager for shareable content,” the report concluded.

Another source of concern for some is whether WeChat outlets translating and packaging the news have fact-checking mechanisms in place like those at established Chinese-language media in the U.S.

“Not only do they not have fact-checking or any traditional norms of journalism governing how they operate,” Zhang said, “there’s an incentive to editorialize and make the narrative, the story, more sensational than what they found on the Internet.”

Outlets do this, she said, to make themselves stand out from the pack.

Joe Wei, managing editor of The World Journal, a U.S.-based Chinese-language newspaper, said he believes the majority of WeChat content is translated and disseminated by people in China.

He said the goal is not to give readers a better understanding of what’s happening in the U.S., but rather to expose conflict in the country, in an effort to show that China is better than the U.S.

For his part, Wang, who runs the Chinese Americans for Trump private WeChat group, said he doesn’t believe WeChat is being used to give first-generation Chinese-Americans a distorted view of U.S. politics.

“People do their own fact-checking, big time,” he said. “We’re not just going to believe a link on a website, not from a critical source, saying whatever. Everybody does their critical thinking, independent research, and we encourage people to do that so they’re immune from the fake news media.”

Wang added that they have moderators who fact-check news that is shared. Action is taken when something is found to be amiss.

“People would point out a link, saying this is fake news, it didn’t happen, it’s not real, and we would all just stop spreading,” he said.

Wei, however, expressed concern over how the content of some WeChat outlets is curated.

Speaking in Mandarin, he said right-leaning and pro-Trump groups tend to select, or cherry pick, social issues for WeChat that first-generation Chinese Americans are familiar with.

Those have included opposition toward affirmative action, allegations of Asian-American admissions quotas at Harvard University, and laws requiring that education and healthcare data only for Asian Americans be broken down by ethnicity.

But other issues, like the questionable use of force by some police officers toward black men, may get short shrift or not be covered at all, according to Wei.

The common theme that resonates for many first-generation Chinese-American immigrants is a feeling of being discriminated against or marginalized, observers note.

And that, they say, has helped galvanize support through WeChat to rally around these issues.

A NEW MEDIUM FOR THE MESSAGE

These days, fewer first-generation Chinese-American immigrants appear to be getting their news from traditional sources, like print media, Wei said.

Instead, they’re turning to WeChat and the platform’s official accounts, personal groups and “Moments” section, where users share information with their friends.

Chinese-language print media in the U.S. will likely adjust in the coming years by shifting its focus more to local news, including on-the-ground reporting about life in Chinese-American communities and the difficulties residents face, Wei said.

Established Chinese ethnic media outlets, including The World Journal, have also responded by setting up their own official WeChat accounts.

“In the last few years, we have been investing tremendously, building up a news-information platform that includes website, social media, print and electronic newspaper,” Wei said of The World Journal.

To combat misinformation on WeChat, Zhang’s report said more English-language media, government agencies and community groups should use the platform for two-way communication.

And ethnic media, the report added, can serve as “vehicles of verified information,” even as WeChat seems to have garnered a sizeable audience.

“Substantial and credible local news is more crucial than ever for immigrant groups, especially on stories and policy issues prone to misinterpretation,” the report said.

President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un returned home Wednesday, with commentators left to debate the merits of their unprecedented summit in Singapore.

For Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, his work in the region isn't over.

On Wednesday, he flew to the South Korean capital of Seoul for meetings with Gen. Vincent Brooks, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.

One of the unexpected outcomes of the talks was Trump's revelation that he had agreed to pause joint military exercises with South Korea.

This appeared to blindside both the Pentagon and South Korea's military, and was criticized by some experts as giving away a huge concession for little in return.

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis revived his lapsed sex abuse advisory commission by naming new members Saturday, after coming under fire for his overall handling of the scandal and his support for a Chilean bishop accused by victims of witnessing and ignoring their abuse.

The announcement of the new members of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors came on the same day that a Vatican investigator will take the testimony in New York of one of the main whistleblowers in the Chilean cover-up scandal.

Francis tasked Archbishop Charles Scicluna with the fact-finding mission into Bishop Juan Barros after he came under blistering criticism in Chile for defending Barros and calling the victims' cover-up accusations against him slander.

The initial three-year mandate of commission members had lapsed two months ago, on Dec. 17. Francis named nine new members Saturday and kept seven from the initial group. A Vatican statement said survivors of abuse are included, but didn't identify them to protect their privacy.

None of the most outspoken lay advocates for victims from the original group returned, but a statement stressed that the commission's work would be imbued throughout with the experience of victims. Commission members are to open their April plenary by meeting with victims privately, and discussions are continuing to create an ""international survivor advisory panel"" to advise the commission and make sure the voices of victims are heard in all its deliberations, the statement said.

Francis created the commission in December 2013, responding to complaints that he hadn't prioritized the fight against clerical abuse and cover-up enough. The group's mission was to advise the pope on best practices to protect children, but it faced strong in-house resistance to some of its core proposals.",Pope revives lapsed sex abuse commission after coming under fire,http://nbcnews.com/news/world/pope-revives-lapsed-sex-abuse-commission-after-coming-under-fire-n848991
377,377,,nbcnews.com,"May 23 was supposed to be a happy day. After roughly a three-year wait, Xiu Qing You had finally been granted an interview for a green card, according to his attorney, Yee Ling Poon.

But for You, things took an unexpected turn at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan when, according to Poon, the 39-year-old was taken into custody and transported to a federal detention facility in New Jersey.

Yu Mei Chen, You’s wife, said she originally thought Poon was joking when she told her what had happened to her husband.

“I never imagined that he would be arrested,” Chen told NBC News in Mandarin on Friday.

U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement in an email confirmed the May 23 arrest of a Chinese citizen named Xian Chin Yu, which was based on his final order of removal. Poon said this was how U.S. government officials spelled You’s name, which he gave to them in Chinese when he arrived in the U.S. without having applied to immigrate.

You arrived in January 2000 without a valid entry document and ICE began removal proceedings for him in March of that year. That December, an immigration judge ordered him to be removed from the country. His appeal to that decision was turned down that same month.

Poon said You had applied for asylum sometime after entering the U.S. He claimed that

he and his girlfriend at that time had conceived a child who “was aborted by the Chinese government because of the fact that they were not married,” according to Poon, who did not represent You at that point.

His asylum claim was denied and an appeal was unsuccessful, Poon added. A removal order was issued in 2002, she said.

You put in a motion to reopen his case in May 2008, but that too was dismissed in September of that year, according to ICE.

Nearly 10 years later, ICE said deportation officers took You into custody in May pending his removal.

Meanwhile, as the years ticked by, You built a life in the U.S., meeting his future wife, Chen, in 2006, according to Poon. The two had a traditional Chinese wedding banquet a year later, but didn’t officially register their marriage until around 2013, Poon said.

The couple, who live in Queens, opened a nail salon in Connecticut and had two children, a 6-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son, Chen said.

Chen became a naturalized U.S. citizen in January 2015, having earlier filed a successful asylum claim because she was forced to have an abortion while in China, according to Poon. In March of that year, You filed for a green card, Poon said.

But the couple didn’t hear back, according to Poon, so they submitted paperwork in federal court asking the government to work on their application. They believed that they had been granted an interview on May 23.

Chen recalled getting dressed up for the occasion.

“It was a special day,” she said.

At the interview, Chen and You were asked a lot of questions about their marriage, according to Poon, who went with them. “Everything looks fine, the officer was happy about it,” Poon said.

Chen was then asked to leave the room, Poon said. The officer inquired with You about whether the order of removal was for him since the spelling on that document was different from the name he provided on the application, according to Poon. You affirmed it was the same, his lawyer said.

Soon after, ICE agents arrested You and brought him to the Bergen County Jail, an ICE detention facility in New Jersey, Poon said.

Chen said her children keep asking where their father went and when he’ll return.

“Sometimes I’ll say, 'Dad will come back soon,' ” Chen said, crying. “I’ll say he went off to work elsewhere.”

Poon said You often took care of the kids since Chen spent more time working in the nail salon. At night, You would tell them bedtime stories, Chen said.

You’s absence has taken a toll on their oldest child, Mia, who Chen said may have some sense of what happened.

“Now that her father is not by her side at night, she says she’s afraid,” Chen said, adding that her daughter cries. She said You really misses his kids and calls every day to hear their voices.

“His state of mind in the beginning wasn’t very good,” Chen said. “He kept crying, fearing he’ll be sent back.”

Poon said You has no criminal record and they’re pursuing a number of legal avenues to keep him in the country. That includes filing a stay of removal and a motion with the Board of Immigration Appeals to reopen his asylum proceedings.

Poon said the couple's church wrote a letter on behalf of You stating that he is Roman Catholic. You fears that he could be religiously persecuted if deported to China, according to Poon.

Chen said they’ve become accustomed to life in the U.S. after all these years, adding that both of their children were born here.

“I hope our family can stay together and that my husband can continue to live in the U.S.,” Chen said.","Chinese citizen arrested, detained at green card interview",http://nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/chinese-national-arrested-detained-green-card-interview-n884066
378,378,,nbcnews.com,"LOS ANGELES — About 9.3 million people in the United States are eligible to apply for citizenship, and a new initiative is offering a financial incentive to cities that can help make this happen.

The nonprofit National Partnership for New Americans recently announced a $5 million pot of cash for cities that can match grants while launching imaginative programs to get immigrants into the naturalization pipeline.

A key goal for newcomers who take advantage of the America is Home program, the organization notes in a statement, is ""refuge from persecution.""

Organizers of the four-year initiative are trying not to politicize it, and they say outreach will include non-Latino communities, specifically Asian ones. But they also admit that the Trump administration's increased deportation, family separation policy and crackdown on alleged naturalization cheaters have created an urgent backdrop.

""We’re doing our best to try to overcome those traumas that the immigrant community is suffering right now,"" says the partnership's George Escobar. ""We've been seeing a lot of fear under the Trump administration.""

The program will grant $25,000 to $40,000 a year for two years to city-sponsored naturalization efforts that can match those dollar figures with money or in-kind services.

Applying for citizenship is not easy, as Mohamed Ouhane, 67, originally from Morocco, can attest. He said his green card process turned into a multi-year ordeal after an unscrupulous lawyer took his money but offered no results. He now volunteers with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, which helped him obtain permanent residency.

He said via email he wants U.S. citizenship and that he would take advantage of any help.

""Programs like this one — the ‘America is Home’ Initiative — inspire me because, as an immigrant, I want to give back to this country,"" he said. ""I will have to enroll in classes to become a naturalized citizen and this program may help fund these classes.""

City mayors are being recruited to spark the initiative's local citizenship drives.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti joined in the launch of America is Home, saying in a statement, ""We know that they will need to receive the knowledge, tools, and support necessary to guide them as they learn and apply for U.S. citizenship.""

""Citizenship unlocks better opportunities and a greater sense of security for our communities and our cities,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio added in the same statement.

But organizers say their aim is not limited to urban areas.

""There is a whole ton of people ready to naturalize in the big metro areas like L.A., Boston and Miami,"" Escobar said. ""But one of the objectives we have is to really go beyond that — go to rural areas, to red states...To partner with local counties and municipalities outside the top 10 cities.""

Despite immigrants' fears, organizers of the initiative say there's motivation and demand to join the ranks of America's voting class.

""We’re seeing high numbers for naturalization after the election,"" said Sarah Mesick, programs and training manager for the National Partnership for New Americans. ""This is an opportunity to support the interest that’s already there.""

“Yappie” is “not that complicated,” Wang says when asked to describe the series. It’s a show about a young man navigating life and understanding the ways being Asian has affected him growing up, whether he realized it or not.

It was an idea Wang had for years as headlines about the lack of Asian-American representation on screen grew, but the challenges of getting it made became the center of frustration.

“When I was going around pitching this show, I met with a lot of big production companies. I explained how ‘Yappie’ is a look at the modern Asian-American experience and how our social issues and identities intersect with our lives. A lot of the feedback I was getting was, ‘Why? What’s the hook?’ And I’m like, ‘That is the hook!’” he said.

It’s a struggle that isn’t unique to a channel like Wong Fu, who is often seen as being pioneers of the platform and trailblazers for other Asian-American creators.

“YouTube is a place where Asian Americans have done well and have established audiences, but for some reason that hasn’t given Hollywood enough evidence or proof that they can go ahead and start a whole series with Wong Fu or Ryan Higa,” said Nancy Wang Yuen, a Biola University associate professor and one of the authors of a study that examined Asian American and Pacific Islander representation on television. “We need more stories about Asians going through life, just trying to live life as Asian Americans and dealing with the racism they experience and that are happening to people who have been here for generations.”

For “Yappie,” Wang scaled his initial pitch back, focusing instead on just creating the show instead of trying to get a studio or a brand to bite. The series ended up being self-funded, which includes funds from Wong Fu’s Patreon supporters, and Wang hopes the five episodes they could afford to make are enough to spark interest in a second season.

“This is the first time where we’re getting out of our comfort zone to try things we haven’t done before, which is talking about issues, talking about things that are more personal,” he said.

But he knows “Yappie” won’t be able to address all of the issues — or the criticism about Wong Fu in general that has led Wang to come out swinging on Twitter in response to what he says are accusations of “white-worshipping.""

Some of the criticism was focused on an Instagram promo that showed a Caucasian actor in the middle of the frame (the series’ cast is largely Asian American, and Wang explained the photo is a still image from the series that’s been misinterpreted); others in the YouTube comments for the trailer pointed out the lack of diversity in Wong Fu’s depiction of Asian Americans as being primarily of East Asian descent.

“I do feel the responsibility,” Wang said. “It is frustrating, but I don’t blame them because there is so little content out there.”

That criticism is one he actively thinks about, but he knows Wong Fu can’t take it on alone. “I honestly wish we can write a story for every person that’s out there,” he said. “My response when I hear this — and I don’t mean this in an arrogant way — is: you should go make this yourself. Figure out a way that you can have that outlet and put up that content that you want to see. People have this idea that since Wong Fu tells so many stories, we should tell all stories, but we aren’t an ABC or NBC. People think we have all these shows, but we can only afford to make one a year that’s only five episodes.”

THE NEXT PAGE

Wang acknowledges he’s still learning, and ""Yappie"" is reflective of that growth. He describes his character, Andrew, as being “basic,” and says the series is meant to show the process of Andrew — and the audience watching — waking up and caring about his community.

“Andrew is me if Wong Fu never happened,” Wang said about realizing who the main character was. “As soon as that clicked, I said, ‘Oh my God,’ because I never allowed myself to think of my story or my voice as special. In the show, I want to portray this character’s development. I want to make this relevant to people who know what it’s like to fade out in the background. I want to empower them to ask, ‘Well, what makes me me?’”

The culture has changed and we weren’t part of that, but I’m glad because we stayed focused to use it as a platform to tell our stories.

And that’s a journey that may end up taking place outside of YouTube someday as the platform continues to change. The video trends that have catapulted other creators to the top in shorter amounts of time don’t necessarily interest Wang, which contributes to his perspective that Wong Fu still has a way to go.

“YouTube became so big so fast that kids now see this as a challenge to get into it, just like how I used to see it as a challenge to get into Hollywood,” he said. “We could do the clickbait, easy turnaround, fast casual videos, but the things that will progress our community are films, shows, and stories that will change the way people see us.”

It’s one of the reasons he hopes audiences will give “Yappie” a chance, particularly at a time when the mainstream media has begun catching on to the need for Asian-American representation in Hollywood.

“We don’t have one common struggle, one common mission. ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ — not my narrative, but it’s going to enable another movie. ‘Master of None’ — not my narrative, but it empowered me to make my version,” Wang said. “I hope someone sees ‘Yappie’ and says, ‘That’s cool, but I’m going to tell my southern Vietnamese story growing up around all Hispanic people,’ or whatever your story is.”

PESHAWAR, Pakistan — The leader of the Pakistani Taliban was killed by a U.S. drone strike, an Afghan official said Friday.

Mullah Fazlullah Khorasani was Pakistan's most-wanted militant and blamed for attacks including a 2014 school massacre that killed 132 children and the 2012 shooting of schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai, who was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

In March, the U.S. offered a $5 million reward for information on Fazlullah.

Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanish told NBC News that Fazlullah died in a strike in the Marawaya district of the border province of Kunar.

Earlier, Lt. Col Martin O’Donnell, a spokesman for U.S. Forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement that U.S. forces had carried out an airstrike Thursday in Kunar ""which targeted a senior leader of a designated terrorist organization.""

Fazlullah's death could ease strained ties between Islamabad and Washington even as Afghanistan observes an unprecedented three-day ceasefire with the larger Afghan Taliban.

Pakistan is considered key to persuading Afghan Taliban leaders, who Washington believes shelter on Pakistani soil, to open negotiations to end the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan.

Prior to the Afghan Defense Ministry stating that Fazlullah had been killed, several members of the Pakistani Taliban told NBC News they had been unable to make contact with him and other senior commanders since receiving word of the strike.

They said they feared four other top commanders may also have been killed.

""Most of our people are seriously concerned ‎after they heard about the killing of our leader, but the top leadership is out of access,"" Pakistani Taliban commander Maulvi Obaidur Rahman told NBC News.

Like many other Pakistani militants, Khorasani had crossed into Afghanistan after the Pakistani army launched a major military offensive in the Swat Valley in 2009.

On June 23, 1993, a Virginia manicurist named Lorena Bobbitt cut off her husband’s penis with a 12-inch knife. The incident inspired a national media circus: tabloid headlines, late-night gags, “Saturday Night Live” sketches, T-shirts saying “Love Hurts,” a made-for-TV musical, the third verse of a “Weird Al” Yankovic parody track, and a ballad to the tune of the theme from “The Beverly Hillbillies.”

But there was much more to the story — and now, 25 years later, it's being revisited.

A new book on cultural history and an upcoming documentary series take a closer look at the case, rejecting sensationalism and reframing Bobbitt's ordeal in the era of #MeToo.

Bobbitt, who was charged with “malicious wounding” and put on trial, claimed that her husband at the time, John Wayne Bobbitt, had subjected her to years of physical, sexual and emotional abuse, forcing her into sex on his demand. In the early morning hours before the attack, she alleged, he came home drunk and raped her.

Lorena Bobbitt’s acquittal in January 1994, as The New York Times wrote at the time, “highlighted the plight and rights of abused women.” In the popular imagination, however, she would remain a punchline, the main character in a grotesque, half-remembered American sideshow. The larger context — domestic violence, sexual assault — faded from view, only barely making its way into the national conversation.

The journalist Allison Yarrow profiles Bobbitt in “90s Bitch: Media, Culture and the Failed Promise of Gender Equality.” Jordan Peele, the Oscar-winning writer and director of “Get Out,” is co-producing a four-part Amazon Prime project called “Lorena,” the streaming giant announced earlier this year.

""On the 25th anniversary of this incident, and as awareness continues to increase surrounding violence against women, I look forward to the opportunity to tell aspects of my story that haven't yet been told, and that I hope will give some measure of support to other victims of this horrible epidemic,"" Bobbitt, who remarried and now goes by Lorena Gallo, said in a news release about the docuseries.

Yarrow’s book appears to be a similar effort to show the case from a different vantage point.

“Lorena Bobbitt was part of a group of women — everyone from Hillary Clinton and Monica Lewinsky to Tonya Harding — who were shamed in the 1990s, women who were what I call ‘bitchified’ — undermined, objectified, and thwarted by a sexist media narrative,” Yarrow told NBC News this week.

“The abuse of Lorena Bobbitt was ignored in favor of a narrative that celebrated male sexuality and shamed her for being a vengeful perpetrator, instead of shining a light on domestic violence and abuse,” Yarrow added.

The pop culture detritus from the era suggests Yarrow is on to something. The supermarket tabloids and magazine covers seized on the sheer tawdriness of the case. Jay Leno regularly mocked Bobbitt on “The Tonight Show,” riffing in one monologue: “It was so cold in Virginia … that the snowman in Lorena Bobbitt’s backyard had its carrot snapped right off.”

Her ex-husband, John Wayne Bobbitt, seemed to capitalize on his strange fame. He became a regular guest on “The Howard Stern Show” — the shock jock reportedly attempted to raise funds for his guest’s medical and legal fees — and played himself in a pornographic film titled “John Wayne Bobbitt: Uncut.”

“Of course, [the case] isn’t very hard to make funny. It was late-night fodder, it was all jokes,” said Phyllis D. Barkhurst, the co-director of the Center for the Prevention of Abuse and Neglect in Oregon. “But that was my issue — it was all jokes.”

The more humane reaction from parts of the news media and the entertainment industry would have been to try to “put yourself in her shoes” and try to understand the context, according to Barkhurst. “What drove somebody to that level of desperation? This was a woman who was determined never to be raped again,” Barkhurst said.

Heather Schuster, the head of unscripted programming at Amazon Originals, told NBC News that the goal of the docuseries is to ""peel away all of that joke fodder, to tell the real story of an abused woman who felt trapped in her life and her marriage.""

John Wayne Bobbitt, an ex-Marine, has denied raping his former wife. He was acquitted of marital sexual assault in a separate legal proceeding in November 1993. They were divorced in the mid-1990s.

Lorena Gallo, 47, did not immediately respond to an interview request. She now runs Lorena’s Red Wagon, a foundation that raises money for victims of domestic abuse and their children.

“I took my life back and I [gave] myself a second chance,” Gallo told NBC News affiliate WRC-TV in 2014.

Blair D. Howard, 78, one of Lorena Gallo's three attorneys, said this week that the flurry of late-night jokes and water cooler snickering in the 1990s certainly missed the point.

But he believes the grave reality of domestic violence was not lost on the jurors who found his client not guilty by reason of temporary insanity.

“The message we want to send is that finally people have recognized that keeping families together ought to be the baseline of all conversations about immigration reform,” said the Rev. Seth Kaper-Dale, co-pastor of the New Jersey-based Reformed Church of Highland Park, who organized the trip.

Kaper-Dale — who has offered his church as a sanctuary to immigrants, including Indonesians, in fear of deportation — said much of the recent attention has been focused on family separations at the border.

“This country ought to be concerned about kids beings separated in the interior of the country too,” he added.

Kaper-Dale said he plans to travel Tuesday to D.C. with seven children, ages 9 to 16, and rally first in the morning at the Supreme Court. Later, they are slated to visit with members of Congress from New Jersey, including Sens. Cory Booker and Bob Menendez, as well as Rep. Frank Pallone, all Democrats.

“We know that the congressional solutions will take a long time...and we’d like the Supreme Court to find a way to stop the bleeding, if you will, and help families immediately,” Kaper-Dale said.

Part of the group are children of Roby Sangr and Gunawan Liem, both from Indonesia, the reverend said. The pair was picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in January. Each had overstayed his tourist visa and had not applied for asylum within the required time, according to Kaper-Dale.

He said the men are ethnic Chinese Christians who fled Indonesia in the mid-to-late ‘90s to escape the the collapse of the Suharto regime, which experienced cronyism and corruption. A large group ended up settling in central New Jersey.

Sangr and Liem do not have criminal records, Kaper-Dale said.

The American Civil Liberties Union, who in February won a temporary restraining order halting their deportations, said courts have ruled that persecution or torture is a risk that Christians, especially of Chinese descent, would encounter in Indonesia.

U.S. law prohibits removal of people who would likely face persecution or torture, according to the ACLU.

The church’s D.C. trip comes as debate over immigration grips the nation.

President Donald Trump last week signed an executive order reversing his administration's policy of separating children from their parents at the border and allowing families to instead be detained together.

Trump said the order ""will solve that problem"" of children being separated from their parents, though it would not end his administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy of charging everyone who attempts to cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.

As of June 20, there were 2,053 separated minors being cared for in facilities funded by the Department of Health and Human Services, according to a Department of Homeland Security statement released June 23. Customs and Border Protection had reunited 522 children separated from adults as part of the zero-tolerance policy, the release said.

But in some recent cases, families that have already laid down roots in the U.S. have also been broken up as immigrant family members, for various reasons, have been taken into custody by immigration agents.

Sangr and Liem are all being held in ICE detention centers in New Jersey, Kaper-Dale said.

He said he hopes elected officials come up with a real immigration solution.

“These are not kids who are used to speaking to the media or speaking to lawmakers, but they are quickly figuring out that what they have left right now is their voice — and they have to use it,” the reverend said.

TORNILLO, Texas — An emergency manager at a Texas detention facility housing hundreds of migrant children in a tent encampment said Monday that the separation of families resulting from President Donald Trump’s policies “should have never happened.”

""This shelter would not have been necessary without the separations,"" the emergency manager, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was concerned for his safety, said during a media tour of the facility. ""The crisis was a result of the decision to separate the kids. The separations should have never happened.""

He added: ""The process is flawed and it harmed the children. I would like to never do this mission again.""

NBC News was part of a group that went into the Tornillo detention facility and saw firsthand what life was like for unaccompanied and separated children. Cameras and cellphones were not allowed inside.

The facility holds 326 kids aged 13 to 17. Most are boys, but the facility also holds 14 girls in separate tents. Of the children held there, 117 children are from Honduras, 40 are from El Salvador, 162 are from Guatemala and three are from Mexico. Four others include one Romanian teen and one Nicaraguan.

The boys’ sleeping tents had five bunks on a side and 20 to a tent and resembled a barracks. The beds were neatly made and everything was labeled in military jargon, with the tents labeled Alpha 1, Alpha 2, and so on. There are 22 tents in this facility, with two set aside for girls.

The schedule for the day was labeled “battle rhythm.”

Early Monday afternoon, 18 children were lined up for the telephone tent. They are allowed two calls a week, 10 minutes at a time. They’re given three meals a day and two snacks. They came to the facility with whatever clothing they were given at a previous facility.

The boys shower 10 at a time; there is one shower to 15 kids and one toilet to 10.

None of the children were brought to Tornillo directly after being separated from their parents. They were moved from one of a hundred facilities in 17 states to make space for younger, including tender age, children. That is because Tornillo is considered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to be inappropriate for housing younger children.

In terms of the children separated from their parents, 26 have been placed in the Tornillo facility since it went up. Of those, three have now been reunited with their parents and 23 remain in the facility. The case managers working with the kids say that their top priority is reuniting these kids with their parents.

President Donald Trump's administration selected Tornillo for the construction of the ""tent city"" facility to house the migrant children earlier this month.

As of June 20, there were 2,053 children being cared for in facilities funded by the Department of Health and Human Services.

Also on Monday, Secretary of Defense James Mattis said two U.S. military bases in Texas, Fort Bliss and Goodfellow Air Force Base, would be used to house migrants.

The children at Tornillo are on a strict, structured routine, and carefully supervised. Staffers wore bright green shirts and could be seen everywhere. Children do activities in same-sex groups, with boys and girls strictly separated, with time allotted for sports if it’s not too hot. Some boys played soccer Monday as the tour went on.

The emergency manager who made the remarks about family separation works for BCFS, a private nonprofit group that specializes in emergency management. The nonprofit is the vendor running this facility on what is federal property. According to HHS, it has done emergency management work after Hurricane Katrina and more recently in Puerto Rico.","Child separations 'should have never happened,' says emergency manager at Tornillo tent facility",http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/child-separations-should-have-never-happened-says-emergency-manager-tornillo-n886456
385,385,,nbcnews.com,"Erdogan suggested exchanging Brunson for Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, living in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania, who is accused of masterminding the coup attempt. Gulen denies the charge.

Cagaptay believes that if he wins Erdogan will strengthen his push to make Turkey politically Islamist, alienating secularists and increasing instability as the two sides clash over the direction of the country.

“An Erdogan victory actually threatens to throw Turkey into a deep, long-term political crisis,” he said.

UNEXPECTED OPPOSITION

That victory isn’t as clear as many first expected.

Erdogan called the snap election, bringing forward a vote that was originally due to be held in November 2019, ahead of a potential financial crisis.

Rapid economic growth has slowed and Turkey's currency plummeted 25 percent this year. It hit a record low after Erdogan said he would increase his control of financial policy following the election while on a visit to London in May.

""The polls suggest that for the electorate, the economic issues are overtaking security issues,"" said Serhat Guvenc, professor at Kadir Has University, to the Associated Press.

That presented an opportunity Erdogan's rivals have seized upon with unexpectedly engaging campaigns.

The country's opposition found momentum early on, when four parties announced a surprise alliance for the parliamentary elections.

The alliance includes Meral Aksener's Good Party, consisting of nationalists and center-right figures. But the main opposition is the CHP, whose candidate Muharrem Ince — a 54-year-old former physics teacher — has tried to appeal to conservative Turks with his oratory skills and by showcasing his practicing Muslim family.

Ince has courted the crucial Kurdish vote by visiting Selahattin Demirtas, the imprisoned candidate of the pro-Kurdish HDP.

While not in the alliance, HDP’s support could prove crucial for the opposition candidate in a prospective second round and in denying Erdogan's party a majority in parliament.

Erdogan accuses the HDP of connections to the militant group the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is classified as a terrorist organization by Turkey and the U.S.

Violence has also marred the campaign and with the majority of media outlets under the control of Erdogan and his allies, opposition candidates are struggling to get their voices heard.

FINAL STRETCH

Candidates made their final push on Saturday.

Ince's final rally drew at least a million supporters to Istanbul's Maltepe district, police said. “There are 5 million people in Maltepe right now but none of the TV channels can show it,” Ince said, highlighting the opposition's claims of media bias.

That figure could not be independently verified, though images circulating on social media showed vast crowds of people assembled to hear Ince speak.

Braving a summer thunderstorm, Ince's supporters, in festive mood, sang anthems and waved red and white Turkish flags as their candidate promise to reverse Turkey's turn towards authoritarian rule under Erdogan.

On the other side of the Bosphorus, the waterway bisecting Istanbul and separating Europe from Asia, thousands filled a road in suburban Istanbul to hear Erdogan talk up his infrastructure projects. The strongman president ask the crowd if they had built a bridge, an airport and improved the country. ""Yes we did!"" they shouted back.

""He's the only leader standing for the whole Muslim community and all of Turkey,"" said Yakup Kalkan, 22, a textile manager attending the rally. ""Yes, the economy is bad, but because of foreign games, especially [from] America.""

Erdogan has remained the front-runner throughout, but after allegations of vote-rigging in last year's referendum on presidential powers, questions linger among the opposition over what will happen if the vote is as tight as it’s now predicted to be.

The two main opposition leader cast their votes on Sunday and vowed vigilance amid fears of possible fraud.

Aksener told reporters in Istanbul: ""I hope these elections are beneficial and truly reflect the free will of the voters.""

About three weeks after calling the election, Erdogan told parliament: “If one day our nation says 'enough,' then we will step aside.”

Turkey may get to see if he keeps that promise a lot sooner than anyone expected.

A contractor building high-end houses in Minneapolis swung by Greg Hull’s sawmill on Friday, a timber operation located in deeply rural Lake County, Minnesota. The builder had seen Hull’s website and driven nearly 250 miles to the mill to inspect Hull’s high-end lumber as potential building material for his homes.

These days that’s not unusual. In the past year-and-a-half, Hull has seen orders balloon and interest grow, and a significant factor is his recent ability to gain access to high-speed internet. That's made a huge difference for the saw mill, located at the end of a power line in an area that knows only gravel roads and limited cellphone coverage.

“Before, if you wanted to download or do anything on the internet, back when it was a phone line system, you couldn’t do anything,” said Hull, who lives and works on 100 acres of Minnesota woodland. “I had to go to the library or hire someone to do stuff, but now we can do it all. We have an improved website. It’s made the whole internet presence a lot more viable, which has in turn opened the exposure.”

That’s something largely new to Lake County, an area that covers 3,000 square miles and stretches from the shores of Lake Superior to the Canadian border. About 10,000 people call this area home. But local leaders there decided they needed high-speed internet, and after nearly eight years and the investment of more than $80 million — much of it coming from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (also known as former President Barack Obama's stimulus bill) — access to the internet is beginning to boost the local economy.

That could mean a long-term impact of tens of millions of dollars in household economic benefit and residential real estate value, a report by the Blandin Foundation claimed.

The economic upside of internet access is being pushed by rural broadband advocates across the country who say that there isn’t enough being done to connect rural communities. Building out the necessary infrastructure, they argue, could function as an economic and informational driver for some of the country’s most cash-strapped regions.

Spotty coverage

There's reason to think that this could also be an economic boon for the nation. According to an April 2016 study by Hudson Institute, the rural broadband industry supported nearly 70,000 jobs and provided states in which they operated with more than $24 billion in 2015.

But one of the largest challenges, advocates say, is that there isn’t enough data to know where to invest effectively.

Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., recently got into a scrape with the Federal Communications Commission after he discovered the FCC put out a map that claimed 98 percent of Mississippi had access to a reliable 4G LTE wireless internet connection. Wicker said he found the conclusion “absurd” and “troublesome.”

The FCC planned to use the map to decide where to place more than $4.5 billion in rural broadband subsidies, which has major implications for communities nationwide.

Wicker led a group of senators in demanding that the FCC reconsider its map, pushing for a 90-day extension to listen to challenges of its accuracy. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced late last month that he would grant the senator’s request.

In Mississippi, one of the poorest states in the country, which is also struggling to retain its millennial population and hoping to attract job-providing companies, the FCC map is crucial.

“In places like Mississippi, this means our state’s talented students miss out on opportunities to learn and to grow,” Wicker told NBC News in a statement. “Elderly and disabled residents in the Delta can’t access lifesaving telehealth services that connect doctors to patients. And, our farmers aren’t able to deploy the latest precision agriculture technologies that can help boost yields and increase productivity in an increasingly competitive global market.”

“We’re having to reinvent ourselves and we’re having to do it quickly. The quality of technology is a huge part of that. That’s driving what’s going on in our community to allow people to live here, stay here and work remotely.”

That’s a problem that Lake County saw on the horizon, which is why local leaders agreed to pour so much money into the project. To them, many said, it was an investment into basic infrastructure.

“For rural America, there’s a major struggle to keep people and ideas in these small communities,” said Chris Swanson, the mayor of Two Harbors, the largest town in Lake County, with around 4,000 people. “We’re having to reinvent ourselves and we’re having to do it quickly. The quality of technology is a huge part of that. That’s driving what’s going on in our community to allow people to live here, stay here and work remotely.”

The unknown grid

It’s not just the map of 4G LTE coverage that has sparked controversy.

The American Reinvestment Act provided funding for all 50 states, five territories and the District of Columbia to extend broadband availability to rural areas, allowing policymakers and others to make informed decisions when allocating resources. But the funding for that project expired in 2015 and each year the data it produced becomes increasingly inaccurate and irrelevant.

To make matters even more difficult for rural communities, major telecom companies don’t see many dollar signs in their own future by providing rural areas with access to the expensive infrastructure.

The FCC and state commissions now depend on internet service providers to self-report their coverage areas based on census blocks, and that creates numerous issues, according to Johnathan Hladik, the policy director for the Center for Rural Affairs.

Hladik explained that service providers can mark a census block as “served” if one household within it has access to broadband, no matter how many others have the ability to gain access. In some cases, a provider can also mark a block as “served” when no household has access if the block could be served without an “extraordinary commitment of resources.”

Hladik is now working to convince the Nebraska legislature to invest in greater coverage for the state, an issue that he was able to bring to the floor during the last legislative session but without success.

“We think that the state should require that data collection and mapping be done at the address level and it should include the speed, type of technology, service area location and any limitations for service,” Hladik said. “We think service providers should provide this information to the FCC or state commission and standardize the data.”

The tech gap

Without investment, communities without internet access are in danger of falling behind the growing digital economy that has an increasingly large stake in the U.S. Workers are now expected to have a large amount of digital know-how when entering the workplace.

“What we know off the bat is that if you don’t have broadband you will be left out,” said Roberto Gallardo, the assistant director of the Purdue Center for Regional Development. “If you do have it, it really is analogous to the installation of a railroad 100 years ago or a highway 50 years ago. Broadband has that same potential to connect communities.”

But it remains to be seen if or when major investment into rural broadband will be pursued.

Shirley Bloomfield, the CEO of the Rural Broadband Association, warns that leaders should be careful with how they pursue rural broadband. Accountability has to be a huge part of any infrastructure investment, especially because these dollars are so precious.

“One of the things that is concerning any time you say that government resources are coming here is you get fly by night operations, you get folks who don’t know how to build broadband but they see federal dollars,” Bloomfield said. “It’s important there’s accountability here because resources are very scarce.”","Rural communities see big returns with broadband access, but roadblocks persist",http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/rural-communities-see-big-returns-broadband-access-roadblocks-persist-n881731

The author of the ""Little House on the Prairie"" series, Laura Ingalls Wilder, had her name removed from a prestigious children's book award because of ""dated cultural attitudes"" contained in her books, the association that issues the award said Monday.

In a joint statement, the American Library Association and the Association for Library Service to Children said the name of the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award was changed to the Children's Literature Legacy Award during a weekend conference in New Orleans.

""Her works reflect dated cultural attitudes toward Indigenous people and people of color that contradict modern acceptance, celebration, and understanding of diverse communities,"" the statement said.

Those ""dated"" references are reflected in lines contained in ""Little House on the Prairie,"" which details the years Wilder's family spent living in Kansas, an area heavily populated by Native Americans. The book includes a line: ""The only good Indian is a dead Indian.""

The book also uses the term ""papoose"" for a Native American baby, which has historically evoked genocide for some.

The change signaled the latest example of a culture reckoning with its racist history. The removal of Confederate statues in Baltimore; Charlottesville, Virginia; Memphis, Tennessee; and New Orleans and beyond have offered the most high-profile flashpoints in this reckoning, although cities and institutions across the United States have also sought to change street, plaza and church names.

The statement said the ""Little House"" series — which was based on Wilder's 19th-century pioneer childhood — would ""continue to be deeply meaningful to many readers."" But the Association for Library Service to Children, which issues the award, ""has had to grapple with the inconsistency between Wilder's legacy and its core values of inclusiveness, integrity and respect, and responsiveness through an award that bears Wilder's name,"" it said.

The statement added that the change shouldn't be viewed as an effort to censor Wilder's work but as an attempt to ""align the award's title"" with the association's ""core values.""

A group dedicated to Wilder scholarship, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Legacy and Research Association, criticized the change in a statement, saying it wasn't ""beneficial to the body of literature to sweep away her name as though the perspectives in her books never existed.""

""Those perspectives are teaching moments to show generations to come how the past was and how we, as a society, must move forward with a more inclusive and diverse perspective,"" said the statement, which was issued by the group's board.",Laura Ingalls Wilder's name removed from prestigious award over 'dated' attitudes,http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/laura-ingalls-wilder-s-name-removed-prestigious-award-over-dated-n886491
389,389,,nbcnews.com,"CoStar says the trove contained proof its intellectual property was being ripped off, a claim its competitor denies.

But there was also something far more disturbing: indications that Backpage used Avion to drum up business in the sex trade overseas, undermining its claim that it does nothing more than host and moderate ads.

""We got 1.7 million photographs,"" Curtis Ricketts, senior vice president of CoStar, told NBC News of the December 2016 raid.

""It was building picture, building picture, porn, porn, prostitute ad, building picture and then — bang! — a picture that couldn't be anything other than, you know, child pornography.

""We just immediately shut the computer off, picked the phone up, called the attorneys. They called the FBI,"" Ricketts said.

Curtis Ricketts of CoStar says he had never heard of Backpage before the raid in the Philippines. NBC News

Accompanying the photos were thousands of documents linking Avion to Backpage, which has been vigorously fighting a slew of charges in the U.S. that it promotes prostitution and child exploitation. There is no evidence the child pornography was linked to Backpage, but the advertisements for sex clearly were.

CoStar chief executive Andrew Florance said he had never even heard of Backpage, so when the name kept turning up in the Avion documents, he and Ricketts looked it up on Google.

One of the first things they clicked on was a 90-second trailer for ""I Am Jane Doe,"" a documentary that follows girls who say they were pimped out through Backpage ads. Next came stories about a 20-month U.S. Senate investigation that found Backpage complicit in trafficking.

The company's legal woes also include criminal charges refiled last year by the state of California against its CEO and two founders and a civil lawsuit now headed for trial in Washington state after the courts declined to dismiss it.

Backpage's defense is that it's not responsible for ads posted on the site, based on Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act which says that online service providers cannot be held liable for content provided by third parties.

The company also says that it does what it can to crack down on illegal activity by hiring moderators to flag problematic content.

But, according to Florance, ""when we looked at what we saw in the Philippines, we saw something that did not go with that storyline at all.""

""They appeared to us to be actively engaged in looking worldwide to try to find prostitutes to get them to bring their wares to be sold on Backpage,"" he said.

The material seized by CoStar shows Avion worked to promote adult ad business on behalf of Backpage overseas, including in the United Kingdom and Australia.

It included audio recordings of Avion workers contacting people who posted sexually explicit ads on rival escort sites and offering them a free ad on Backpage.

An Avion employee manual includes step-by-step instructions on how to use a fake IP and email address to pose as someone responding to an adult ad on a rival site. It details how to create escort ads on competitor sites, by copying photos from real Backpage ads, to widen the pool of customers and then invite them to Backpage.

There was a spreadsheet of emails written by Avion employees to people who had viewed ads on rival sites, redirecting them to Backpage. ""Hi cutie! … I moved my post to backpage,"" reads one email.

The only Avion activity explicitly occurring in the U.S. that was found in the data involved ""moderating"" or policing adult ads for content. An email sent from a Backpage account to Avion employees reads: ""I was reviewing deleted ads and the crew seems to be doing a great job catching bad stuff. Here are a few removals that I restored. Some only needed pics removed.""",Backpage Critics Find Surprise Ammunition in Philippines Raid,http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/backpage-critics-find-surprise-ammunition-philippines-raid-n778221

392,392,,nbcnews.com,"SWISSVALE, Pa. — Hundreds gathered in a school auditorium Monday to pay respects to Antwon Rose, the unarmed 17-year-old high school student who was killed by a police officer last week.

Rose, a rising senior and honor student, was shot three times after fleeing a vehicle during a traffic stop and running away from officers.

The funeral service was mostly restricted to friends and family. The ceremony was held at Woodland Hills Intermediate School, where Rose attended middle school. No protests were scheduled Monday out of respect for his family.

Mary Brookins, a substitute teacher at the school, said she is hurt and confused by Rose’s death and said the teen was always respectful to her.

“I have sons and it could have been my son,"" Brookins told NBC News. ""I can always remember that smile he had.""

“No one has a harsh thing to say about him because there is nothing harsh to say,” added Lillian McClain, who grew up with Rose's family.

On Sunday, hundreds passed through Tunie Funeral Home during Rose's wake — some wearing shirts that read, ""3 shots to the back, how do you justify that?"" Since Rose's death, protests have become commonplace in the East Pittsburgh area where the fatal shooting occurred.

The healing process can only begin when Antwon, his family, and the community get justice.""

Michael Rosfeld, 30, the officer who fired the fatal shots, has been placed on administrative lead pending an investigation into the incident. Rosfeld had been on the job three weeks and was sworn into the East Pittsburgh Police Department 90 minutes prior to the shooting.

During five nights of protests, community activists and members have called for stronger police accountability and for Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala to bring forth criminal charges against Rosfeld.

The Pittsburgh Black Elected Officials Coalition, which works to transform's the city's black communities, called for criminal charges ""immediately.""

""The healing process can only begin when Antwon, his family, and the community get justice,"" the group said in a statement.

The Allegheny County District Attorney's official Twitter account did not specify when the office would address the status of their investigation.

NBC News reached out to Zappala for additional comment but has not received a response. Rosfield's attorney Pat Thomassey said he and his client decline to comment.

Michelle Kenney, Rose’s mother, told ABC News she believes the officer “murdered my son in cold blood.”

“If he has a son, I pray his heart never has to hurt the way mine does,"" Kenney said. “But I think he should pay for taking my son's life. I really do.”

East Pittsburgh Police initially pulled over the vehicle Rose was in because they say it matched the description of a car involved in a drive-by shooting 13 minutes earlier.

According to Allegheny County Police Superintendent Coleman McDonough, the driver of the vehicle was ordered out of the car by officers. That's when Rose and another male “bolted from the vehicle on foot.”

In a cellphone video posted on social media by witness Shauny Mary, Rose and another man are seen getting out of the passenger side of a silver Chevy Cruze and running before multiple shots are fired.

According to McDonough, two semi-automatic handguns were found on the floor of the vehicle and they found Rose was unarmed and an empty gun clip was found in his pocket.

Police officials have urged community members to be patient so his office can conduct a ""fair and objective investigation.""

Last week, researchers reported on the impact of China's policy changes in the journal Science Advances. The researchers studied 28 years of data from the United Nations' Comtrade database to measure exports of plastics to China, which processed much of the waste and turned it into new products. Projecting the rate of processing into the future, they estimated that, over the next dozen years, 111 million metric tons of waste will no longer find an afterlife in China.

""This is a wake-up call,"" said Amy Brooks, the lead author of the report and an engineering doctoral student at the University of Georgia. ""Historically, we've been depending on China to take in this recycled waste, and now they are saying 'No.' That waste has to be managed, and we have to manage it properly.""

Even with the world's efforts to recycle plastic — especially single-use items like bags, bottles and straws — only about 9 percent gets repurposed, while most ends up in landfills or contaminates the oceans, according to the researchers.

China first signaled that it no longer wanted to be the dumping ground for the world's synthetic garbage in 2013, when it enacted a temporary restriction and required markedly less contamination in the plastic shipments it allows into the country. The so-called Green Fence policy was a forerunner of the permanent ban that went into effect at the end of 2017, driven by China's concerns about the long-term environmental impact of its being the world's waste depot.","With China saying no to plastic waste, the world needs a new plan",http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-saying-no-plastic-waste-world-needs-new-plan-n885946

Estefan, Arsht commented, “is the embodiment of the American dream,” and having left Cuba at a young age for Miami, “Gloria remembers the housing rental signs that said ‘No children. No pets. No Cubans.’”

In accepting the award, Estefan said, “I’ve had so many moments of ‘Pinch me, how is this happening,’ and this is one of them. I’ve been so lucky that through our music we’ve been able to bridge instead of build walls,"" she said.

“We are all in this together. And no matter what happens, no matter what challenges we face in the world, in this country, when there are people trying to get together, trying to work it out, trying to understand each other, trying to make bridges, then I know that we’re in a good place,” said Estefan, adding that she was “incredibly honored and thrilled” to receive the award.

“I cannot tell you enough how much I love this country, how much I am proud of having grown up here, how much I try to be emblematic of that freedom through my songs that I write, celebrating freedom of speech, celebrating the things that I’ve grown up, thankfully, in this country, experiencing,” she said.

Estefan has been the recipient of other prestigious awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom awarded by President Barack Obama, multiple Billboard Awards and the Kennedy Center Honors, becoming the first Cuban American to receive such recognition.

In 2017, Estefan was selected as one of the nominees for the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Prior to that, she was inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014.

Many consider Estefan’s work crucial in bringing Latin sounds to the American mainstream and pop music scenes.

During the late 1970s, she first became well-known for her lead singing role in the band Miami Sound Machine.

She later released the chart-topping album ‘Mi Tierra’, leading her to eventually become one of the most iconic and influential cross-over pop stars of all times.

She and her husband Emilio Estefan took her talent and life story to Broadway through their musical 'On Your Feet!' which takes audiences back to the 1980s when Miami Sound Machine’s ""1-2-3"" chart-topping hit song was listened by Americans everywhere. After a successful Broadway run the musical is on a national tour.

President George W. Bush, General Curtis M. Scaparrotti and Starbucks founder Howard Schultz were also honored by the Atlantic Council alongside Estefan, receiving awards for their contributions in international relations, the military and business — respectively. In his remarks, Bush called Estefan, “mi amiga,"" Spanish for ""my friend.""

The evening included a performance by actress and singer Ana Villafañe, best known her portrayal of Estefan in the Tony-nominated On Your Feet!

Previous honorees have included Plácido Domingo and Juanes.

Patricia Guadalupe reported from Washington, D.C. and Nicole Acevedo from New York.

Dick Leitsch, a titan of the early gay rights movement who led ""sip-in"" protests in the 1960s, died in New York City on Friday, Ken Lustbader, the co-director of NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project confirmed to NBC News. He was 83.

Leitsch became an icon of the LGBTQ movement after leading protests that pre-dated the Stonewall Inn uprising, increasing the momentum of the gay rights movement.

""Without Dick and people like him who are brave, courageous and risked so much when being out was so dangerous, we wouldn’t be here today,"" Lustbader said.

Born on May 11, 1935, Leitsch moved to New York City in 1959 from his home state of Kentucky.

He went on to lead the the New York City chapter of the Mattachine Society, one of the oldest gay rights organizations in the country. It was during his time at the Mattachine Society that he came up with the idea for ""sip-ins.""

At the time, it was common practice for bars to serve members of the gay community under a no-questions-asked policy, according to The New York Times. The policy was unwritten by the State Liquor Authority, which regarded homosexuals as ""disorderly."" During this period, the New York State Liquor Authority could revoke a bars' liquor license if it knowingly served gay people.

Inspired by the African-American civil rights lunch counter protests in the South, in 1966, Leitsch, along with at least two other gay men, went from bar to bar announcing that they were gay and asking to be served. When they arrived at Julius' Bar in the Greenwich Village, Leitsch told the bartender, ""We are homosexuals. We are orderly, we intend to remain orderly, and we are asking for service.""

The bartender reflexively slapped his hand over Leitsch's glass. The moment was immortalized by Village Voice photographer Fred W. McDarrah.

“The Mattachine Society tried desperately to get people to accept homosexuality,” Leitsch told NBC News in 2017. “We wanted people to see who we are, what we are.”

The Mattachine Society threatened to sue over the refusal of service at Julius', which caused then-liquor authority chairman Donald S. Hostetter to deny the policy of not serving gays existed and said the authority never threatened liquor licenses, according to the Times.

The following year, New York State courts ruled against the New York State Liquor Authority's theory that homosexuals were inherently disorderly, which ended the practice of revoking liquor licenses for serving openly gay members of the community.

""Today, we take for granted being out of the closet, but if it wasn’t for people like Dick we would be at a loss for a gay pride movement,"" Lustbader said, adding that Leistch was able to make his mark across generations of LGBTQ people. ""The gay pride movement lost a great hero yesterday.""

Julius' went on to be considered the oldest gay bar in New York City. On April 21, Leitsch attended a celebration of the 52nd anniversary of the ""sip-in"" at the bar.

During the Stonewall riots in 1969,then New York City Mayor John Lindsay is reported to have called Leitsch, begging him to do something to end the violence.

“Even if I could, I wouldn’t,” Leitsch reportedly replied. “I’ve been trying for years to get something like this to happen.”

Leitsch learned in February of 2018 that he had terminal liver cancer. Following his diagnosis, he received an onslaught of letters from admires, including former President Barack Obama, who thanked Leitsch for ""decades of work to help drive our nation forward on the path toward L.G.B.T. equality.""

On Sunday, just two days after Leitsch died, New York City's Pride Parade will see thousands of people marching down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.

""I would say the Pride Parade marching tomorrow — everyone is marching and standing on the shoulders of Dick Leitsch,"" Lustbader said.

Leitsch is survived by his brother John Leitsch and his sister Joanne Williams, according to the Times. He was preceded in death by his partner Timothy Scoffield, who died in 1989 from complications due to AIDS.","Gay rights pioneer Dick Leitsch, who held 'sip-in' protest, dies at 83",http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gay-rights-pioneer-dick-leitsch-who-held-sip-protest-dies-n885996

Feeling ""humiliated and ashamed of my own body,"" Rosa then went out to dance with her teammates. Her skin became sweaty and irritated underneath the tape.

""My skin was being torn,"" she said.

Rosa joins an existing lawsuit against the team in which five former cheerleaders claim that they weren't paid for many of the hours that they worked, and that they were bullied and sexually harassed.

The suit was filed in Houston federal court earlier this month.

Allred said the team fostered a ""culture of fear"" in which cheerleaders were ""reminded that they were replaceable,"" all while getting paid a meager $7.25 an hour.

The suit alleges that the Texans didn't compensate the cheerleaders for appearances, including ones during overseas trips, and other job-related tasks. The women also weren't given stipends for food during work trips, it claims.

The other plaintiffs are fellow former cheerleaders Hannah Turnbow, Ainsley Parish, Morgan Wiederhold, Ashley Rodriguez, and Kelly Neuner.

Rosa said she worked out twice a day three to four times a week and said the comments about her appearance prompted her to not treat her body ""as I should, just to get the results that she wanted."" She recalled surviving off of only popcorn and water to lose weight.

Allred, holding up a picture of Rosa in her cheerleadibng outfit, told reporters, ""It's ridiculous to call a person who looks like this 'skinny-fat.' First of all, no one should be called fat, let alone 'skinny-fat.' ""

Allred said that she filed an amended lawsuit Friday morning with Rosa on it, and adding certain claims, including ""assault — which this is.""

The suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages.

Rosa said the alleged treatment was devastating, particularly because she had dreamed of becoming a cheerleader since she was a little girl, when her father would take her to sporting events.

""I wanted to be a leader and a role model to the young girls that I once was,"" she said.

Amy Palcic, vice president of communications for the Houston Texans, said the team had no additional comment on Friday.

Earlier in the month, when the lawsuit was first filed, the team defended its cheerleader program.

""We are proud of the cheerleader program and have had hundreds of women participate and enjoy their experience while making a positive impact in the local community,"" it said. ""We are constantly evaluating our procedures and will continue to make adjustments as needed to make the program enjoyable for everyone.""","Sixth cheerleader sues Houston Texans, claims coach duct-taped her body",http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sixth-cheerleader-sues-houston-texans-claims-coach-duct-taped-her-n885781
397,397,,nbcnews.com,"As a caretaker for the past 10 years in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, Nora Gutierrez has had to endure low wages along with numerous injustices including sexual harassment at one point.

Currently, she cares for an elderly person, which means doing laundry, cooking lunch and dinner, sweeping, cleaning bathrooms, and many other tasks she is given.

“If a relative arrives to the house while I’m doing this, they want me to serve them as well. But it’s not in my contract,” Gutierrez said.

Making $7.25 an hour, her salary tallies up to $280 every 15 days. She works through an agency, so she is limited to the hours they assign her.

Gutierrez is one of many Latina domestic workers facing severe economic hardship in the Texas-Mexico border area, including hunger, housing insecurity, and not being able to pay basic expenses, according to a study released Tuesday. The report by the National Domestic Workers Alliance in conjunction with several local organizations, is the first quantitative study involving a sizable number of domestic workers in the Texas-Mexico border area.

“This report is very important,” said Rosa Sanluis, of Fuerza del Valle Worker’s Center and one of the lead staffers on the project. “We all knew about the exploitation, but no one had ever documented it before,” she said.

Almost four in 10 — over 37 percent — of those surveyed said someone in their home went hungry in the past year. More than half said they were not able to pay for a family member's medical care if they needed it and 44 percent could not pay rent on time. Almost 60 percent were unable to pay the electric bill and 42 percent could not pay a phone or water bill.

Women who clean homes have the highest levels of economic hardship. Around 57 percent said they couldn’t pay their rent on time in the past 12 months, compared to 33 percent of elderly caretakers.

The report found exploitation based on immigration status. A little over four in 10 — 43 percent — were legal permanent residents or U.S. citizens. Though almost 70 percent of those who cared for the elderly had legal status, 80 percent of house cleaners did not. Unauthorized workers were twice as likely to be threatened by an employer and three times more likely to be pushed or hurt on the job.

A.Y.U.D.A., Fuerza del Valle Worker’s Center, and Labor Justice Committee – all community based organizations from the Texas-Mexico border area – along with the National Domestic Workers Alliance collaborated on the report.

The organizations trained 36 women, mostly domestic workers from the community, as surveyors. In turn, they interviewed 516 house cleaners, nannies, and caretakers for elderly and disabled people who work in private homes.

Training women from the community was key in order to gain the trust of workers during interviews.

“For many workers, it was difficult to say there is hunger in their family,” Sanluis said. Instead, they would say “'my food stamps run out on the 20th and after that, 'I can’t buy meat for the family.'”

Domestic workers, especially house cleaners, also battle against wage theft. Almost a quarter of those interviewed reported they were paid less than was agreed upon for their work or were not paid at all.

The workers also endure other kinds of abuse. Being yelled at and threatened are current occurrences, the report found.

Live-in workers are the most exploited, according to the report. Around 45 percent said they had been paid less than agreed or not at all and 60 percent were pressured to work more than the scheduled hours.

Some of the most difficult moments for Sanluis was having the workers recount traumatic incidents like sexual abuse because she felt they were reliving the event as they described them. “I felt impotent seeing all the injustice, the pain, the tears. That was very difficult,” Sanluis said.

They hope the report will help with advocacy to help improve workplace abuse and also to help shape policy.

“We are going to elevate these stories of domestic workers from their perspective and not the perspective of those who oppress us,” Sanluis said.

The author of the ""Little House on the Prairie"" series, Laura Ingalls Wilder, had her name removed from a prestigious children's book award because of ""dated cultural attitudes"" contained in her books, the association that issues the award said Monday.

In a joint statement, the American Library Association and the Association for Library Service to Children said the name of the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award was changed to the Children's Literature Legacy Award during a weekend conference in New Orleans.

""Her works reflect dated cultural attitudes toward Indigenous people and people of color that contradict modern acceptance, celebration, and understanding of diverse communities,"" the statement said.

Those ""dated"" references are reflected in lines contained in ""Little House on the Prairie,"" which details the years Wilder's family spent living in Kansas, an area heavily populated by Native Americans. The book includes a line: ""The only good Indian is a dead Indian.""

The book also uses the term ""papoose"" for a Native American baby, which has historically evoked genocide for some.

The change signaled the latest example of a culture reckoning with its racist history. The removal of Confederate statues in Baltimore; Charlottesville, Virginia; Memphis, Tennessee; and New Orleans and beyond have offered the most high-profile flashpoints in this reckoning, although cities and institutions across the United States have also sought to change street, plaza and church names.

The statement said the ""Little House"" series — which was based on Wilder's 19th-century pioneer childhood — would ""continue to be deeply meaningful to many readers."" But the Association for Library Service to Children, which issues the award, ""has had to grapple with the inconsistency between Wilder's legacy and its core values of inclusiveness, integrity and respect, and responsiveness through an award that bears Wilder's name,"" it said.

The statement added that the change shouldn't be viewed as an effort to censor Wilder's work but as an attempt to ""align the award's title"" with the association's ""core values.""

A group dedicated to Wilder scholarship, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Legacy and Research Association, criticized the change in a statement, saying it wasn't ""beneficial to the body of literature to sweep away her name as though the perspectives in her books never existed.""

""Those perspectives are teaching moments to show generations to come how the past was and how we, as a society, must move forward with a more inclusive and diverse perspective,"" said the statement, which was issued by the group's board.",Laura Ingalls Wilder's name removed from prestigious award over 'dated' attitudes,http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/laura-ingalls-wilder-s-name-removed-prestigious-award-over-dated-n886491

Federal prosecutors in New York canceled a planned meeting with adult film star Stormy Daniels as part of their criminal investigation into President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, Daniels' attorney said late Sunday night.

Multiple people familiar with the matter had previously told NBC News that Daniels — whose real name is Stephanie Clifford — was scheduled to meet with the prosecutors Monday in Manhattan. But her attorney, Michael Avenatti, told NBC News that prosecutors from the office of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York told him that they were calling off the meeting, which he said had been scheduled for weeks, because the news media had found out about it and there would be cameras outside.

Avenatti said that he offered to hold the meeting at another location of prosecutors' choosing but that it hadn't been rescheduled.

""This is unheard of,"" he said separately on Twitter. ""We remain willing to cooperate but something isn't right ...""

Cohen, 51, hasn't been charged with any crimes. The FBI raided his office and hotel room in April and is believed to be seeking information about a $130,000 payment Cohen made to Daniels as part of a nondisclosure agreement related to an affair she has alleged to have had with Trump.

NBC News reported in April that Daniels is cooperating with federal investigators.

Mohamed Salah is carrying the hopes of a nation at soccer's World Cup.

There’s only one problem: Egypt’s 25-year-old forward injured his right shoulder during last month’s Champions League final, threatening a nightmare end to a dream season.

Liverpool Football Club paid around $50 million last summer for Salah — who is known as ""Mo.""

He shot to stardom by scoring 32 goals for the club in 36 English Premier League games, adding 10 more in the Champions League.

But while Salah's thrilling attacking displays and love for the game have won him fans around the globe, what he does after he scores is just as important.

After celebrating and embracing his teammates, Salah performs sujood, the Islamic act of prostration.

Though he is far from the only Muslim among the world’s best players, few express their religion so overtly and the unabashed statement of his faith has helped make Salah an icon across the Arab world.

In England, where anti-Muslim sentiment is increasingly evident and soccer fans have not always had a reputation for embracing diversity, Salah has become a folk hero.

“If he's good enough for you, he's good enough for me,” Liverpool fans regularly chant. “If he scores another few, then I'll be Muslim too.”

Others songs refer to Salah as the supporters' ""Egyptian king.""

Some in the northern English city of Liverpool's Muslim community say Salah’s status has had an impact far beyond the soccer field.

“I think he's brought a huge positive change in the minds of people,” said Mumin Khan, co-founder and chief executive of the city's Abdullah Quilliam Mosque. “[Salah] has brought people together, communities together. [He] has broken all the barriers about negative perception that people hold about the Islamic faith.”

He is also influential back home in Egypt, where he has financed a girls’ school, a food distribution center and medical facilities in his hometown of Nagrig, a small farming community north of Cairo.

On the streets of Egyptian capital, traditional Ramadan lanterns featuring Salah were this year’s hottest-selling item.

“All the children want to be Mohamed Salah,” vendor Saber Mohamed told NBC News. “He has a lovable personality.”

Such is Salah's popularity that in recent presidential elections he reportedly garnered more than 1 million votes as Egyptians took a novel approach to spoiling their ballots.

“I think he’s very humble about what he does,” said Mostafa Moussa, a high school student from Cairo. “It makes people happy that an Egyptian player is playing for Liverpool ... He’s an inspiration for everyone. It makes you think you can do anything.”

Hamdy Nouh, a famous Egyptian striker from the 1980s, said he saw the makings of a star when he coached Salah at the age of 14.

“He wanted to learn and he wanted to achieve,” Nouh recalled. “I told him that he is going to become professional, that he will become a great and famous player.”

Salah has become all that and more.

His remarkable season helped Liverpool reach the Champions League final for the first time in a decade.

But in the opening stages of last month's tense game, Salah tangled with Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos and fell to the ground in pain. Despite attempting to carry on, he left the field in tears.

Without Salah, Liverpool lost 3-1. But in Egypt, attention quickly turned to whether Salah’s injury would deprive him of the chance to star in the World Cup, which represents the pinnacle of international soccer.

Egypt heads to the tournament, which kicked off Thursday as hosts Russia beat Saudi Arabia 5-0, as a solid and well-organized team with a chance of making it to the knockout stages.

But that becomes more difficult without Salah, who is both their key player and talisman.

Egypt's first game is taking place on Friday against Uruguay, a crucial opener that will go a long way to determining whether the ""Pharoahs"" make it past the first round.

Amid rumor and counter-rumor, it fell to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to ease his nation’s concerns.

""The president was reassured on the health condition of the player Mohamed Salah, who affirmed that his condition is improving notably and that he is on his way to recovery, god willing,"" presidency spokesman Bassam Radi said Saturday.

Sisi’s intervention underscores just how important Salah has become, not just to his team but to his homeland.

""He said there would be massive decreases in prices within two weeks,"" Warren said. ""It's been two weeks and there have been no decreases and an indication of increase.""

Azar insisted that several drug companies “are looking at substantial and material decreases of drug prices.”

“Can you guarantee that no Medicare beneficiary will pay higher drug prices as a result of your plan to change coverage under Medicare?” Warren asked.

Azar avoided giving a direct answer, saying only, “We are going to work on it.”

“I’ve asked the question now three times and you’ve given me no answer at all,” Warren said. “You cannot guarantee that there will not be Medicare beneficiaries who will be paying more.”

Medicare is the age-based federal health insurance program that guarantees coverage for individuals aged 65 and over. About 60 million people are signed up for the Medicare prescription drug benefit, which accounts for nearly a third of all spending on prescription drugs in the U.S.

While running for president, Trump broke with Republicans and embraced a longstanding Democratic proposal to allow the federal government to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare recipients.

But in May he released a plan called American Patients First that he claimed would give Medicare ""new tools to negotiate lower prices"" — but does not allow Medicare to barter directly with drug companies to lower prescription prices.

402,402,,www.nbcnews.com,"ALAMO, Texas — After weeks of making calls, Priscilla Mendoza, a law clerk with the Texas Civil Rights Project, got a break Monday in one of the missing child cases the nonprofit is working on after family separations on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Mendoza was on the phone Monday afternoon pumping a government official for information, when she confirmed that the child a father had been trying to find since May 29 was indeed in federal custody.

The scene took place in the bare-bones, single-story office the project shares with other nonprofits, as the federal government was on the other side of the state telling reporters it was ""fully aware"" of the whereabouts of every parent and child separated at the border.

Mendoza and her colleague Alexis Bay are spending their summer in the Rio Grande Valley. They're among the attorneys trying to help track down the children who were separated from their parents as a result of the Trump administration’s policy of prosecuting immigrants caught crossing the border illegally, a misdemeanor.

On Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a Senate Finance hearing, “There is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located.”

This follows statements on Monday in Tornillo, Texas, where HHS spokesman Mark Weber said the agency was “fully aware” of where the separated children and parents are.

“I will emphasize, we know where their parents are, we have connected with their parents in almost every case,” Weber said, speaking at the compound where the government is keeping some of the children who were separated from their parents. He said they are aggressively looking and if a parent has a hard time finding the child, ""we are going to find them.""

Advocates and attorneys say that may be the case, but that information about the children's whereabouts isn't being shared with them.

“That's a low bar. They know where they are?” Efrén Olivares, director of the Texas Civil Rights Projects' racial and economic justice program, told NBC News. “They took them.”

'There is no claim ticket' to find children

The work to connect children and parents and get them an attorney is “a race against the clock,” said Olivares, because in some cases, when attorneys and advocates have made checks, the parent is no longer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the child is no longer with the Office of Refugee Resettlement.

“That means they were released or deported — I can only hope that means together,” he said.

M. Lucero Ortiz, director of legal services of the Central American Resource Center, or Carecen, based in Washington, said she fears that reunifying the parents won’t go smoothly because documentation in the transfer of immigrants from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and ICE is minimal and often has mistakes.

“When people are processed through CBP, they have to turn in their possessions and they give them their receipt and are told they can pick up these items later. We value those items more than children,” Ortiz said. “People weren’t even given a basic piece of paper. … There is no claim ticket.”

The Texas Civil Rights Project started in earnest searching for children after the Trump administration announced its ""zero tolerance"" policy for illegal immigration last month and as attorneys here found that the number of parents separated from children was growing.

After weeks of pressure, the Trump administration stopped the separations.

Attorneys with the Texas Civil Rights Project have been going to the federal court in McAllen, Texas, since May 24 to gather as much information as possible from migrants who were prosecuted on charges of crossing the border illegally, a misdemeanor of first entry.",'Race against the clock': Lawyers work to track down migrant children separated from parents,http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/race-against-clock-lawyers-work-track-down-migrant-children-separated-n886506

LONDON — Turkey entered a new era Monday, but with the same man in charge.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who at 64 has dominated Turkish politics for 15 years, won another five-year term in presidential elections.

With his term comes sweeping new powers under a new constitution that also weakens Parliament and removes the post of prime minister. Erdogan, who critics accuse of adopting increasingly authoritarian tactics, can pick ministers and judges and could seek re-election again, which could keep him in charge until 2028.

“One nation, one flag, one country, one state,” he shouted to cheering supporters after his victory was announced in the early hours.

His nearest opponent, Muharrem Ince, retorted that the country was now ruled by “one man.”

""Turkey has cut off its links with democracy,” Ince said as he conceded defeat with 30.6 percent of the vote against Erdogan’s 52.5 percent.

But some Erdogan opponents were celebrating early Monday, after his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) lost vote share compared to 2015.

In the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, supporters waved flags and cheered in the streets after the pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic Party (HDP) passed the 10 percent milestone needed to win seats in Parliament despite its main candidate being in jail.

“Despite the very high threshold, which was designed to squeeze out the smaller parties, and pre-election violence, the HDP was able to consolidate its support,” said Fadi Hukara, an expert on Turkey at the London-based think tank, Chatham House.

Some in the government accuse the HDP of links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has been involved in a decadeslong struggle for independence and autonomy.

The results leave Erdogan’s AKP without an outright majority in Parliament but it can comfortably govern thanks to its coalition with nationalists.

""While other candidates could stage 100 campaign rallies, I was able to send out 100 tweets.""

“In this new system, the Parliament is only there to make it look like a democracy,” said Ibrahim Dogus, director of Centre for Turkey Studies in London. “Most of the powers are now with the president, with Erdogan. It’s a bespoke system designed to suit Erdogan’s personal aspirations.”

He added: “This is a new era in Turkey where a very powerful individual, accused of being more and more authoritarian, has extended his powers, and it could end up in a very difficult and unpredictable future.”

Erdogan’s win could also deepen Turkey's rift with its Western and NATO allies concerned by its setbacks in democracy and human rights as well as its closer ties with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Erdogan a congratulatory telegram Monday, one of the first world leaders to do so.

“A lot will depend on the president’s attitude to opposition, and he has not been very kind to his opponents so far,” Dogus said. “So many academics and journalists are in jail.”

In his pre-dawn victory speech, Erdogan appeared to double down on his agenda, saying he would work toward achieving his goal of making Turkey one of the world's top 10 economies by 2023, when the Turkish Republic marks its centenary.

He also pledged a more ""determined"" fight against outlawed Kurdish rebels and alleged members of a movement led by U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom he accuses of orchestrating a failed coup in 2016.

A man hit by an ax thrown by a Fox News TV personality has filed a lawsuit alleging negligence and injuries that have left physical and emotional scars.

Pete Hegseth, a co-host of the weekend edition of ""Fox & Friends,"" was participating in a live segment in June 14, 2015, when he tossed an ax at a target but missed, striking a member of the West Point Band, who were there to mark Flag Day and the 240th birthday of the U.S. Army. The band is the official band-in-residence of the U.S. Military Academy.

The band member, drummer Jeff Prosperie, is now bringing a lawsuit against Hegseth, alleging that the host threw an ax at a target who was ""negligently placed"" in an area where people were standing. Prosperie was behind the target.

The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday, alleges that the defendants — Hegseth, Fox News and ""Fox & Friends"" — were ""negligent, wanton, reckless and careless"" in staging the ax-throwing event, part of an upcoming segment on lumberjack contests.

The incident aired on live television, and the footage later circulated widely online.

Prosperie claims in the lawsuit that he has suffered ""severe and serious personal injuries to his mind and body,"" as well as ""permanent effects of pain, disability, disfigurement and loss of body function.""

In a statement, Fox News said the incident was ""unfortunate and completely unintentional.""

""Fox News immediately apologized to Prosperie and offered medical assistance, which he declined, saying he was 'OK.' The network also offered compensation, which he declined as well. We have not heard from Prosperie since 2015, so the lawsuit is surprising and we are reviewing it.""

Prosperie's lawyer, Brandon Cotter, said his client would not comment on the suit. But speaking on Prosperie's behalf, Cotter said his client ""wants to get on with his life, and he tried to do so.""

""But when it became apparent there were lasting issues,"" Prosperie knew he had to file a suit, Cotter said. Prosperie is seeking judgment against the defendants and an unspecific amount in damagest.

Shortly after the ax incident, Prosperie posted on Facebook that he suffered some cuts and a ""significant impact"" from the ax.",'Fox & Friends' co-host faces lawsuit from man he hit with ax,http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fox-friends-co-host-faces-lawsuit-man-he-hit-axe-n883291
406,406,,nbcnews.com,"“The drivers are underwater and if they can’t refinance, they are giving up their medallions,” said Uwazie, who had hoped to one day buy his own medallion but is now glad he didn't. “Those medallions were supposed to be their 401(k)s, but everything has been flushed down the drain.""

In a measure of how shaken drivers in Chicago are by what happened in New York, The Chicago Dispatcher, a monthly newspaper for cab and livery drivers, placed an ad for a suicide prevention hotline on page 3 of the April edition.

Taxi medallions are permits that cities issue to cap the number of cabs on the road. Until the past several years, the value of the medallions seemed to keep rising as large taxi companies, individual operators and other investors bought them up.

Many immigrants saw securing a taxi medallion as the fulfillment of their American Dream, and they financed them as they would a mortgage, assuming they would only grow in value over time.

In 2014, the price of a New York City medallion topped $1 million. That year, they went for $700,000 in Boston, $400,000 in Philadelphia, and $300,0000 in Chicago.

But with the advent of outfits like Uber and Lyft, which cracked the cab monopoly by enabling consumers to hail rides from any registered driver using smartphones, loans for medallions dried up as the prices plummeted. Last year, more people used Uber than yellow cabs in New York City, according to the city’s Taxi & Limousine Commission, or TLC.

It’s an economic crisis across the industry and across the country.

Meanwhile, cabbies and cab company operators have been unloading their medallions, the chief reason being bankruptcy. At a recent auction, the bidding for five New York City taxi medallions put up by the Aspire Federal Credit Union started at $150,000, and none sold for more than $200,000, Crain’s New York reported.

The situation in Chicago is no better. Three years after the city allowed Uber and Lyft to operate, hundreds of cab drivers are frantically trying to unload their medallions, and hundreds more are in foreclosure, said Cab Drivers United, the local union.

“There isn’t any financing available anymore,” said Charles Goodbar, a Chicago lawyer who used to help secure loans for medallion buyers and owns 58 of them himself.

Goodbar recalled an immigrant cabbie, Joseph Slivo, who used every penny he had to make a down payment on a medallion and then found himself unable to keep up the loan payments because he wasn’t making enough on the road.

“He turned his medallion in and a week later he was dead"" of a heart attack, Goodbar said. “It’s sad. This was a family man, a dedicated driver.""

Yu Mein Chow, a New York City cabbie who was found drowned in the East River in May, had taken out a loan seven years ago to buy a $700,000 medallion and was also struggling, The New York Times reported. His family believes he killed himself.

Uber, in a statement, expressed condolences to the Chow family but said he was the victim of predatory lenders and economic change.

“Drivers who own individual medallions have been left behind by change and exploited by lenders, and we support action that eases their financial burden,"" the company said.

Uber also defended the company's practices in New York, saying Uber drivers are not poaching the main territory served by yellow cabs, which is Manhattan.

""Uber has worked hard to grow the transportation pie, ensuring that all New Yorkers can get a ride in minutes, particularly in neighborhoods outside of Manhattan that have been long ignored by yellow taxis and underserved by public transit,” the spokesperson said. “The majority of our trips are happening in the Bronx, Staten Island, Queens and Brooklyn.""

'A deeper crisis'

John Boit, spokesman for the Taxicab, Limousine & Paratransit Association, a national group, said operators like Uber aren't solely to blame for undermining what had been a respectable living for generations of drivers — New York's City Hall also deserves blame for not protecting those who had invested in driving careers, he said.

“The city enriched itself with billions of dollars in medallion sales and then allowed a massive influx of new drivers, clogging the streets and bringing down income industrywide,” he said. “The current situation makes it impossible for many to repay their debts. What the drivers need now is a fair solution for their investment in city medallions and a level playing field for the future.""

The New York City Taxi Workers Alliance, the local yellow cab union, has called for changes including capping the number of for-hire vehicles operating in the city.

Mayor Bill de Blasio has not yet taken a position on the requested changes.

""These are painful stories and heartbreaking losses that no words will heal,"" Austin Finan, a de Blasio spokesman, said. ""The pressures faced today by taxi and for-hire vehicle drivers are enormous. Alongside the council and the TLC, we’re taking a sober look at how to make it easier for drivers to make ends meet in this tough environment.”

This year, the Chicago City Council passed some reforms aimed at helping beleaguered cabbies, like extending limits on vehicle age, which Uber supported.

But taxi drivers still face a different set of fees and rules than Uber drivers. Taxi drivers in Chicago pay more than $2,000 per year in city fees and taxes, while Uber pays an annual $10,000 fee to the city for permission to operate.

Lilia Chacon, a spokeswoman for the office of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, said the ride-share industry is subject to additional taxes beyond the licensing fee and insisted the city has been trying to respond to the concerns of cabbies.

""The city has a continuous dialogue with the taxi industry,"" Chacon said in an email. ""We will always seek to listen to and address the taxi industry's concerns and remain open to additional reforms to streamline and improve the industry.""

But in a city where clout is king, Uber has a direct line to the mayor.

Emanuel's former chief of staff Lisa Schrader now works for Uber. And the Hollywood talent agency headed by Emanuel's brother, Ari, is a big investor in the company.

Before Schifter, the New York livery driver, killed himself in February, he waged what The New York Times called a “one-man campaign to stop Uber from putting his fellow black-car drivers out of business.” He posted a note on Facebook saying he could no longer make a living and blamed the city for not doing more to rein in Uber.

“I am sure there are people feeling pain in cities all over the country,” said Neil Weiss, who is editor of Black Car News, which covers the for-hire vehicle industry in New York. He edited the columns that Schifter wrote for the trade publication and considered him a friend.

In 2013, when there were 47,000 for-hire vehicles in New York, drivers could recoup their initial investment of a car, insurance and licensing and then make a living, Weiss said. Now there are more than 100,000 for-hire vehicles, and about two-thirds of those are Uber rides, according to the TLC.

“Studies have shown that Uber drivers themselves earn below the minimum wage,” said Desai of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance. “There is a deeper crisis here that is destroying the lives and livelihoods of full-time drivers.”

407,407,,nbcnews.com,"ALAMO, Texas — After weeks of making calls, Priscilla Mendoza, a law clerk with the Texas Civil Rights Project, got a break Monday in one of the missing child cases the nonprofit is working on after family separations on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Mendoza was on the phone Monday afternoon pumping a government official for information, when she confirmed that the child a father had been trying to find since May 29 was indeed in federal custody.

The scene took place in the bare-bones, single-story office the project shares with other nonprofits, as the federal government was on the other side of the state telling reporters it was ""fully aware"" of the whereabouts of every parent and child separated at the border.

Mendoza and her colleague Alexis Bay are spending their summer in the Rio Grande Valley. They're among the attorneys trying to help track down the children who were separated from their parents as a result of the Trump administration’s policy of prosecuting immigrants caught crossing the border illegally, a misdemeanor.

On Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a Senate Finance hearing, “There is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located.”

This follows statements on Monday in Tornillo, Texas, where HHS spokesman Mark Weber said the agency was “fully aware” of where the separated children and parents are.

“I will emphasize, we know where their parents are, we have connected with their parents in almost every case,” Weber said, speaking at the compound where the government is keeping some of the children who were separated from their parents. He said they are aggressively looking and if a parent has a hard time finding the child, ""we are going to find them.""

Advocates and attorneys say that may be the case, but that information about the children's whereabouts isn't being shared with them.

“That's a low bar. They know where they are?” Efrén Olivares, director of the Texas Civil Rights Projects' racial and economic justice program, told NBC News. “They took them.”

'There is no claim ticket' to find children

The work to connect children and parents and get them an attorney is “a race against the clock,” said Olivares, because in some cases, when attorneys and advocates have made checks, the parent is no longer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the child is no longer with the Office of Refugee Resettlement.

“That means they were released or deported — I can only hope that means together,” he said.

M. Lucero Ortiz, director of legal services of the Central American Resource Center, or Carecen, based in Washington, said she fears that reunifying the parents won’t go smoothly because documentation in the transfer of immigrants from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and ICE is minimal and often has mistakes.

“When people are processed through CBP, they have to turn in their possessions and they give them their receipt and are told they can pick up these items later. We value those items more than children,” Ortiz said. “People weren’t even given a basic piece of paper. … There is no claim ticket.”

The Texas Civil Rights Project started in earnest searching for children after the Trump administration announced its ""zero tolerance"" policy for illegal immigration last month and as attorneys here found that the number of parents separated from children was growing.

After weeks of pressure, the Trump administration stopped the separations.

Attorneys with the Texas Civil Rights Project have been going to the federal court in McAllen, Texas, since May 24 to gather as much information as possible from migrants who were prosecuted on charges of crossing the border illegally, a misdemeanor of first entry.",'Race against the clock': Lawyers work to track down migrant children separated from parents,http://nbcnews.com/news/latino/race-against-clock-lawyers-work-track-down-migrant-children-separated-n886506

Feeling ""humiliated and ashamed of my own body,"" Rosa then went out to dance with her teammates. Her skin became sweaty and irritated underneath the tape.

""My skin was being torn,"" she said.

Rosa joins an existing lawsuit against the team in which five former cheerleaders claim that they weren't paid for many of the hours that they worked, and that they were bullied and sexually harassed.

The suit was filed in Houston federal court earlier this month.

Allred said the team fostered a ""culture of fear"" in which cheerleaders were ""reminded that they were replaceable,"" all while getting paid a meager $7.25 an hour.

The suit alleges that the Texans didn't compensate the cheerleaders for appearances, including ones during overseas trips, and other job-related tasks. The women also weren't given stipends for food during work trips, it claims.

The other plaintiffs are fellow former cheerleaders Hannah Turnbow, Ainsley Parish, Morgan Wiederhold, Ashley Rodriguez, and Kelly Neuner.

Rosa said she worked out twice a day three to four times a week and said the comments about her appearance prompted her to not treat her body ""as I should, just to get the results that she wanted."" She recalled surviving off of only popcorn and water to lose weight.

Allred, holding up a picture of Rosa in her cheerleadibng outfit, told reporters, ""It's ridiculous to call a person who looks like this 'skinny-fat.' First of all, no one should be called fat, let alone 'skinny-fat.' ""

Allred said that she filed an amended lawsuit Friday morning with Rosa on it, and adding certain claims, including ""assault — which this is.""

The suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages.

Rosa said the alleged treatment was devastating, particularly because she had dreamed of becoming a cheerleader since she was a little girl, when her father would take her to sporting events.

""I wanted to be a leader and a role model to the young girls that I once was,"" she said.

Amy Palcic, vice president of communications for the Houston Texans, said the team had no additional comment on Friday.

Earlier in the month, when the lawsuit was first filed, the team defended its cheerleader program.

""We are proud of the cheerleader program and have had hundreds of women participate and enjoy their experience while making a positive impact in the local community,"" it said.

Hundreds of fans gathered Tuesday night in the Fairfax district of Los Angeles to remember slain rapper XXXTentacion, who was shot dead in Florida on Monday.

According to the Los Angeles Times, between 300 and 500 people thronged Melrose Avenue near Spaulding, blocking traffic. Some climbed onto rooftops, and at one point, a mosh pit formed in the middle of the crowd. Some attendees also formed a candlelight vigil in the middle of a road.

Police became involved around 7:20 p.m. PT, and several police cruisers blocked the intersections around the protesters. Shortly before 9 p.m., more police officers were en route to disperse the crowd, according to NBC Los Angeles.

According to Hollywood Scanner, the crowd became ""increasingly aggressive,"" including jumping on the hood of a news van, swarming vehicles, and throwing things at police. An on-site LAPD helicopter advised that there were 1,000 people in the area and sent out dispersal orders.

NBC Los Angeles reported that a woman ""was injured in the gathering, but details of how she was hurt or her condition were not immediately available.""

In Florida, fans came in a steady stream to mourn and pay their respects at the spot where XXXTentacion, whose real name was name Jahseh Onfroy, 20, was gunned down, some leaving behind expressions of sympathy along a fence and on the sidewalk.

No arrests have been announced in Onfroy's death, who Broward County sheriff's officials say was ambushed by two suspects as he left an upscale motor sports dealership Monday afternoon in his electric BMW.

His attorney, David Bogenschutz, said investigators told him the 20-year-old rapper had visited a bank shortly before the shooting and possibly withdrew cash to buy a motorcycle.

As Tuesday's memorials intensified, Onfroy's ex-girlfriend Geneva Ayala, who was allegedly abused by the rapper while pregnant, tweeted that she was ""broken"" by his death.

""It's disgusting that people are speaking for me,"" she wrote. ""I don't care if no one cared about me however many months ago, I didn't lose my life. He did. It's permanent. I'm still here. Like how do you think that makes me feel? Everyone expecting me to be relieved or happy?! No, i'm broken.""

LONDON — Turkey entered a new era Monday, but with the same man in charge.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who at 64 has dominated Turkish politics for 15 years, won another five-year term in presidential elections.

With his term comes sweeping new powers under a new constitution that also weakens Parliament and removes the post of prime minister. Erdogan, who critics accuse of adopting increasingly authoritarian tactics, can pick ministers and judges and could seek re-election again, which could keep him in charge until 2028.

“One nation, one flag, one country, one state,” he shouted to cheering supporters after his victory was announced in the early hours.

His nearest opponent, Muharrem Ince, retorted that the country was now ruled by “one man.”

""Turkey has cut off its links with democracy,” Ince said as he conceded defeat with 30.6 percent of the vote against Erdogan’s 52.5 percent.

But some Erdogan opponents were celebrating early Monday, after his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) lost vote share compared to 2015.

In the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, supporters waved flags and cheered in the streets after the pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic Party (HDP) passed the 10 percent milestone needed to win seats in Parliament despite its main candidate being in jail.

“Despite the very high threshold, which was designed to squeeze out the smaller parties, and pre-election violence, the HDP was able to consolidate its support,” said Fadi Hukara, an expert on Turkey at the London-based think tank, Chatham House.

Some in the government accuse the HDP of links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has been involved in a decadeslong struggle for independence and autonomy.

The results leave Erdogan’s AKP without an outright majority in Parliament but it can comfortably govern thanks to its coalition with nationalists.

""While other candidates could stage 100 campaign rallies, I was able to send out 100 tweets.""

“In this new system, the Parliament is only there to make it look like a democracy,” said Ibrahim Dogus, director of Centre for Turkey Studies in London. “Most of the powers are now with the president, with Erdogan. It’s a bespoke system designed to suit Erdogan’s personal aspirations.”

He added: “This is a new era in Turkey where a very powerful individual, accused of being more and more authoritarian, has extended his powers, and it could end up in a very difficult and unpredictable future.”

Erdogan’s win could also deepen Turkey's rift with its Western and NATO allies concerned by its setbacks in democracy and human rights as well as its closer ties with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Erdogan a congratulatory telegram Monday, one of the first world leaders to do so.

“A lot will depend on the president’s attitude to opposition, and he has not been very kind to his opponents so far,” Dogus said. “So many academics and journalists are in jail.”

In his pre-dawn victory speech, Erdogan appeared to double down on his agenda, saying he would work toward achieving his goal of making Turkey one of the world's top 10 economies by 2023, when the Turkish Republic marks its centenary.

He also pledged a more ""determined"" fight against outlawed Kurdish rebels and alleged members of a movement led by U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom he accuses of orchestrating a failed coup in 2016.

Some 50,000 people have been arrested and more than 110,000 civil servants have been fired in a massive government crackdown that has taken place under a state of emergency imposed after the coup that is still in place.

LONDON — One of Israel’s largest tech firms has announced a boycott of national airline El Al after it once again moved female customers away from ultra-Orthodox Jewish men despite a court ruling against the practice.

Barak Eilam, CEO of Ra’anana-based software company NICE Systems, said his company would not fly with the Israeli flag-carrier until it changed its “practice and actions discriminating [against] women.”

""At NICE we don't do business with companies that discriminate against race, gender or religion,"" he wrote on LinkedIn.

It comes after a passenger at Kennedy Airport on El Al's New York-Tel Aviv flight on Friday night saw four ultra-Orthodox men refuse to take their assigned seats because they were next to women.

The witness, Khen Rotem, posted on Facebook that the plane’s departure was delayed while male flight attendants at first tried to force the men to sit down, then asked women to move until the stand-off was resolved.

One of the men was so devout that he boarded the plane with his eyes closed in an apparent effort to avoid looking at any woman on board, Rotem said.

While the flight attendants were busy “putting personal practice of faith ahead of individual rights and civil order,” the flight missed its turn for take-off and departed one-and-a-quarter hours late, Rotem wrote.

The incident took place almost a year to the day after a landmark ruling by an Israeli court that airline employees cannot ask female passengers to move seats to accommodate men.

The case was brought against El Al by Renee Rabinowitz, an 82-year-old who fled the Nazis during World War II and who was asked to move seats on a 2015 flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Tel Aviv.

Jerusalem Magistrates Court ordered El Al to set up a procedure for similar occurrences in future and awarded Rabinowitz the equivalent of $1,834 in damages.

El Al did not respond to a request for comment, but in a statement Sunday, reported by The Associated Press, it apologized and said it does its utmost to serve a ""wide array of populations and travelers.""

The Israel Religious Action Center, a progressive group that led last year's case, was also unavailable for comment but asked passengers to report any similar cases. “If you have witnessed or experienced illegal gender segregation, please report the incident to us, and we will take action,” it said on Facebook.

LONDON — A means to an end, or an end to memes?

Tech leaders and digital rights activists in Europe have expressed dismay over new rules they say could change the open nature of the internet forever — and potentially kill meme culture.

They have been fighting against Article 13 of the proposed E.U. Copyright Directive, which would place responsibility for enforcing copyright law on websites and platforms, rather than individuals.

It would mean that any website or platform that allows users to post images, footage, sound or code would have to use content recognition technologies — branded ""censorship machines"" by critics — to filter out just about anything that infringes on a copyright, and either prevent the platform from uploading or push it to seek licenses.

These algorithms could mean that even internet meme culture, in which people use common images to create running jokes, could be unintentionally scuttled.

“I think without a doubt there will be a threat to the way people use memes,” Jim Killock, the executive director of the Open Rights Group, a London-based organization that supports freedom online, told NBC News. “They are clearly reusing copyrighted material, mostly legitimately, but it’s very hard for a machine to know that.""

Lawmakers on the European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs voted in favor of the legislation in the directive — most of the rest of which simply updates copyright law — on Thursday morning.

The legislation is primarily intended to prevent online piracy in music and video. However, in addition to memes, it could affect live-streaming, code sharing, and sampling and remixes in music, as well as satire, parody and protest videos.

And Article 13 isn’t the only part of the legislation causing fierce debate.

Article 11 has been dubbed the Publishers' Neighboring Right, and could force Google, Microsoft and other platforms to pay publishers for showing news snippets, or linking to news content in what has been dubbed a “link tax” by opponents, and a further threat to an open internet.

News publishers, however, have welcomed this particular part of the legislation.

In a statement, the European Newspaper Publishers’ Association said the committee’s ruling was “a victory for fairness.”

“The internet is only as useful as the content that populates it,” said Carlo Perrone, the group’s president.

“This Publishers' Neighboring Right will be key to encouraging further investment in professional, diverse, fact-checked content for the enrichment and enjoyment of everyone, everywhere,"" he said.

The committee’s ruling will probably be the parliament's official stance as it enters into negotiations with E.U. countries on a common position.

However, dissenting lawmakers could still force a parliamentary vote at a general assembly next month. Campaigners against the legislation are therefore turning their attention to members of the European Parliament to make that happen.

Memes could be affected by Article 13 as they invariably feature stills, gifs and clips that are taken from movies, TV, music videos, professional photography and social media posts.

The copyright for this source material usually lies with someone else, although whether copyright is actually being infringed in a meme is a murky legal question, as it could be allowed under fair use or parody laws.

“Until computers develop humanlike intelligence and are able to interact on machine level with human culture to make human cultural judgments, it’s unlikely that computers are going to be able to make these judgments accurately at all,” Killock said.

“Courts often end up deliberating for days over these questions,"" he added. ""Are we really expecting algorithms to do a better job at this point?”

How to enforce laws surrounding content on the internet is an age-old debate in tech.

The developments around Article 13 are yet another sign that responsibility is increasingly falling upon platforms, with the responsibility shifting from those who upload legally questionable content to those who host it.

Another example came in April, when President Donald Trump signed the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, which reduced protections for online platforms hosting content that ""promotes or facilitates prostitution.”

One such meme that may have fallen afoul of the legislation is the jealous girlfriend meme, which became near-ubiquitous on social media last year. The image was originally taken by Barcelona-based photographer Antonio Guillem and placed in stock image libraries.

Guillem owns the copyright for that particular image, but most of those who uploaded their own versions on social platforms wouldn’t have paid the image library a fee when they did so.

If the proposed EU directive were to come into force, content recognition technology could be expected to prevent a meme using Guillem’s photograph from being uploaded to social media without his or the image library’s permission, or directed the user to seek proper licensing.

Article 13 could also affect memes using content from films, Killock said: “Hollywood companies may come on Twitter [and other platforms] and say, ‘You’re making money out of users using our material so we want payment.’”

“Of course, they’re not entitled to pay them under copyright law, but because these tools are so blunt, they might well be able to push for payment,” he added.

Last week, 70 influential tech luminaries — including World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales — signed an open letter to the European Parliament’s president describing Article 13 as an “imminent threat to the future” of the internet.

Following the committee’s ruling, the lobbying group CCIA, whose members include Google, Facebook, eBay, Amazon and Netflix, criticized lawmakers for ignoring the letter.

Maud Sacquet, a senior manager with CCIA, in a statement urged members of the European Parliament ""to contest this report and to support balanced copyright rules, which respect online rights and support Europe’s digital economy.""

And although the legislation will only directly affect internet users in the European Union, Open Rights Group’s Killock said there could be secondary effects for people everywhere.

“If you’ve identified this material and deleted it for European users, why should it be presented for U.S. users?"" he said. ""Clearly if something is identified as infringement and it belongs to a U.S. user, should it be publishable in Europe?""

“It’s very hard to separate these questions out,"" Killock said. ""So almost certainly it will have an impact on U.S. users.”

The legislation does have its supporters, however. The Brussels-based Independent Music Companies Association said the committee’s ruling would address issues surrounding licensing that have created a “value gap” in the music industry for years.

“This is a strong and unambiguous message sent by the European Parliament,"" Helen Smith, the association’s executive chairwoman, said in a statement. ""It clarifies what the music sector has been saying for years: If you are in the business of distributing music or other creative works, you need a license, clear and simple. It's time for the digital market to catch up with progress.""",The end of memes?

HARARE, Zimbabwe — An explosion rocked a stadium in Zimbabwe where President Emmerson Mnangagwa was addressing a political rally on Saturday, his spokesman said, adding the head of state was unhurt and taken to safety.

State media described the blast as an assassination attempt. Vice President Constantino Chiwenga and his wife sustained minor injuries, a source close to Mnangagwa told Reuters.

""There has been an incident at Bulawayo (White City Stadium) where the president was addressing a rally. This is now a police issue but the president is safe at Bulawayo State House,"" spokesman George Charamba told Reuters, adding that the explosion happened in the VIP tent.

Injured people are attended to as they lay on the ground following an explosion at President Emmerson Mnangagwa's rally in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, on Saturday. AP

Mnangagwa had been speaking in Zimbabwe's second-largest city of Bulawayo ahead of next month's election.

Witnesses told The Associated Press that the blast occurred just as Mnangagwa finished addressing the crowd and was leaving the podium.

The president was immediately whisked to a state house in the city to ensure his safety, according to the state-run Zimbabwe Herald.

""Attempt on ED's life,"" the Herald's headline said, referring to the president by his initials.

Footage posted online showed Mnangagwa waving to the crowd, turning to step off the podium and walking into the open-sided VIP tent, where seconds later the explosion occurred. People ducked and screamed and smoke billowed.

State television immediately cut its broadcast.

Bulawayo has traditionally been an opposition stronghold.

'Multiple Attempts'

Spokesman Charamba told The Herald that investigations were underway, and pointed out that there have been ""multiple attempts"" on Mnangagwa's life over the years.

The president himself has openly joked about the attempts, including during his campaigning.

Mnangagwa took power in November after his former ally, longtime leader Robert Mugabe, stepped down under military pressure. That dramatic transfer of power began when Mnangagwa was fired as Mugabe's deputy and said he had to immediately flee the country for his life.

The July 30 election will be the first without Mugabe in the southern African nation since independence in 1980.

Mnangagwa has pledged to hold a free and fair election, inviting Western observers for the first time in almost two decades. Past votes have been marked by allegations of violence and fraud, and the United States and others have said a credible vote is key to lifting international sanctions.",Blast at Zimbabwe rally called assassination attempt on President Mnangagwa,http://nbcnews.com/news/world/blast-zimbabwe-rally-called-assassination-attempt-president-mnangagwa-n886026
415,415,,www.nbcnews.com,"SWISSVALE, Pa. — Hundreds gathered in a school auditorium Monday to pay respects to Antwon Rose, the unarmed 17-year-old high school student who was killed by a police officer last week.

Rose, a rising senior and honor student, was shot three times after fleeing a vehicle during a traffic stop and running away from officers.

The funeral service was mostly restricted to friends and family. The ceremony was held at Woodland Hills Intermediate School, where Rose attended middle school. No protests were scheduled Monday out of respect for his family.

Mary Brookins, a substitute teacher at the school, said she is hurt and confused by Rose’s death and said the teen was always respectful to her.

“I have sons and it could have been my son,"" Brookins told NBC News. ""I can always remember that smile he had.""

“No one has a harsh thing to say about him because there is nothing harsh to say,” added Lillian McClain, who grew up with Rose's family.

On Sunday, hundreds passed through Tunie Funeral Home during Rose's wake — some wearing shirts that read, ""3 shots to the back, how do you justify that?"" Since Rose's death, protests have become commonplace in the East Pittsburgh area where the fatal shooting occurred.

The healing process can only begin when Antwon, his family, and the community get justice.""

Michael Rosfeld, 30, the officer who fired the fatal shots, has been placed on administrative lead pending an investigation into the incident. Rosfeld had been on the job three weeks and was sworn into the East Pittsburgh Police Department 90 minutes prior to the shooting.

During five nights of protests, community activists and members have called for stronger police accountability and for Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala to bring forth criminal charges against Rosfeld.

The Pittsburgh Black Elected Officials Coalition, which works to transform's the city's black communities, called for criminal charges ""immediately.""

""The healing process can only begin when Antwon, his family, and the community get justice,"" the group said in a statement.

The Allegheny County District Attorney's official Twitter account did not specify when the office would address the status of their investigation.

NBC News reached out to Zappala for additional comment but has not received a response. Rosfield's attorney Pat Thomassey said he and his client decline to comment.

Michelle Kenney, Rose’s mother, told ABC News she believes the officer “murdered my son in cold blood.”

“If he has a son, I pray his heart never has to hurt the way mine does,"" Kenney said. “But I think he should pay for taking my son's life. I really do.”

East Pittsburgh Police initially pulled over the vehicle Rose was in because they say it matched the description of a car involved in a drive-by shooting 13 minutes earlier.

According to Allegheny County Police Superintendent Coleman McDonough, the driver of the vehicle was ordered out of the car by officers. That's when Rose and another male “bolted from the vehicle on foot.”

In a cellphone video posted on social media by witness Shauny Mary, Rose and another man are seen getting out of the passenger side of a silver Chevy Cruze and running before multiple shots are fired.

According to McDonough, two semi-automatic handguns were found on the floor of the vehicle and they found Rose was unarmed and an empty gun clip was found in his pocket.

Police officials have urged community members to be patient so his office can conduct a ""fair and objective investigation.""

A Houston hospital has temporarily suspended all procedures in its renown heart transplant program following the recent deaths of two people.

Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center announced that it would suspend its heart transplant program for 14 days as administrators assess what's gone awry with operations.

The decision, first reported by the Houston Chronicle and ProPublica, followed a series of reports by the news outlets, which revealed the departure of several top physicians and an unusually high number of patient deaths in recent years.

The Chronicle and ProPublica reported that the hospital has performed an outsized number of transplants over the past few years resulting in deaths and the departures of several top physicians. One of the program's top two surgeons left earlier this week for another job, according to the Chronicle.

The program's suspension, which was done voluntarily by the hospital, began on Friday.

“We greatly respect and value the trust patients and their families have placed in us over the years, and believe this temporary pause will serve their best interests,” Doug Lawson, CEO of Catholic Health Initiatives Texas Division, which operates Baylor, said in a statement.

Lawson said that an extensive review is already conducted when a transplant fails, but because of recent outcomes, it was decided that an in-depth review was required ""before we move forward with the program.""

The two most recent deaths happened within three months of a transplant, according to the Chronicle.

James ""Lee"" Lewis, 52, died on March 23, after equipment in the operating room ""malfunctioned during a key stage of his transplant surgery,"" the Chronicle reported. Robert Barron, 67, who also had a heart transplant, died on May 5. The paper reported a third person dying in recent weeks.

In 2015, the hospital reported that out of 14 patients who received a heart transplant in the first six months of the year, five died less than a year later, according to the Chronicle and ProPublica. That number was higher than expected, according to the report. However, the hospital said its one-year survival rates were up to 94 percent in 2016 and 2017 — a period of time in which 34 people received transplants — and cited a period of transition as the cause of the lowered rate of survival in 2015.

Although the hospital has paused its transplant program, it said other heart-failure procedures — such as heart-pump implants — will continue. It also said other transplant programs would not be affected.

It also said it will continue to recruit surgical and clinical experts to its heart transplant program during the suspension.",Houston hospital suspends renown heart transplant program following recent deaths,http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/houston-hospital-suspends-renown-heart-transplant-program-following-recent-deaths-n879511

418,418,,nbcnews.com,"Latino children trail behind their white peers by about 3 months when it comes to math skills, and researchers associate this with increased poverty. But there are ways that parents, caregivers and teachers - as well as policy makers and legislators - can work to narrow the gap.

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS WRITE IN CLASSROOM AP Images

Recommendations in a recently released report include encouraging and teaching parents on how to incorporate math into everyday learning, giving teachers the most up-to-date and effective tools to make math learning easy and engaging throughout the day, and urging more enrollment in center-based day care and early education programs. The report also cites data showing the advantages of full-day kindergarten.

Boosting Hispanic children's math skills is critical to the nation's future, since one out of four kindergarten students are Latino, explains Lina Guzmán, the author of a new Child Trends Hispanic Institute report, Make Math Count More for Young Latino Children.

""Latino children are twice as likely to be living in poverty as white children, and much of that gap in early math skills between Latino and black children is explained by poverty,"" said Guzman, who is also the Institute's director. Poverty also contributes to lower rates of enrollment and participation in center-based child care and programs, which boosts learning. Low-income families also have fewer books at home.

Despite the data, there are several different things adults can do to help improve these statistics, and parents can help in relatively easy ways.

""The great thing is we can integrate this, we don't have to make a half hour block to do math skills, we can do this while we're cooking, while we're shopping, while we're walking to school, or by counting the number of trees that we see,"" said Guzmán.

She adds that it doesn't matter what language parents interact with their children in, as long as it incorporates more books and more math games.

Teachers and educators should use lesson plans that help develop math skills throughout the school day.

Policy makers and legislators should be pushing to expand Head Start and universal pre-kindergarten programs, as well as full-day kindergarten.

""Latino children who attend full day kindergarten experience greater increases in their early math skills during the year,"" said Guzmán."" What we found is that 87 percent of Latino children are already in full day kindergarten, so we only have a little bit more to go before all Latino children are involved.""

While expanding these programs costs money, in the long run it pays off. And right now the U.S. ranks 18 among industrialized nations when it comes to numeracy.

""Policymakers are recognizing, increasingly, not only what neuroscience is teaching us, but that during those early years incredible brain development is happening and that is sort of where you get your biggest bang for your buck,"" Guzmán said.

WASHINGTON — North Korean state television aired video on Thursday from the historic summit between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that included a surprising moment when the American president saluted a North Korean general.

Trump reached out to shake the general's hand, and the general responded with a salute. Trump reciprocated, saluting the general back before the men shook hands.

The video is now running over and over on North Korean state television with an enthusiastic anchor track.

Social media exploded with outrage about Trump's salute.

Retired Army Maj. Gen. Paul Eaton, a senior adviser to the advocacy group VoteVets.org, said, ""It is wholly inappropriate for the commander in chief of our armed forces to salute the military of our adversary, especially one which is responsible for a regime of terror, murder and unspeakable horror against its own people.""

Col. Jack Jacobs, a Medal of Honor recipient and an NBC News analyst, said that the North Korean general's salute was a sign of respect but Trump's salute ""seemed like a reflexive action.""

""If I had been his military aide I would have told him, 'They're going to salute you, but don't return the salute, just move smartly down the line.'""

Presidential historian Michael Beschloss told NBC News that ""one test of a leader is that he knows what message a public gesture sends. In this case, either he made a mistake or he was trying to send the message that he doesn't take the human rights abuses by the North Korean military as seriously as many other Americans do.""

In the military a salute is a sign of respect, with a junior officer or junior enlisted service member always saluting first.

While civilians do not return a salute from a military member, the President is the Commander in Chief and will generally return a salute from U.S. military service members but not military from other nations.

In 2009 during his first visit to Japan as president, Barack Obama bowed deeply from the waist when greeting Japanese Emperor Akihito, eliciting criticism from conservatives who said the gesture projected weakness on the world stage.

Trump was quick to criticize Obama a few years later when he bowed during a greeting of Saudi King Abdullah in 2012. ""@BarackObama bowed to Saudi king in public — yet the Dems are questioning @MittRomney's diplomatic skills,"" Trump tweeted.

The Amateur! First @BarackObama was caught bowing to the Saudi King but now the President of Mexico! http://t.co/f0CFiUS9 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 20, 2012

A salute is a sacred element of military service and history. U.S. military members are taught the salute originated in Roman times when knights in armor would raise their visors with their right hand when greeting a fellow knight.

According to a New York Times story from 2009, Ronald Reagan was thought to be the first president to begin returning salutes regularly. He had sought advice from the commandant of the Marine Corps, who told him that as commander in chief he could salute anyone he liked.

In September 2014 Obama saluted with a cup of coffee in his hand, drawing criticism from conservatives and retired military who deemed it the latte salute and displayed it as a evidence that Obama lacked understanding about the military.

Asked about the salute by NBC News, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said he hadn’t seen the video, ""so it’s tough for me to comment on that.""

In less than a year, Candace Owens has gone from a rising political YouTube personality to one of the leading faces — and voices — of the conservative effort to win back the votes of young and minority Americans.

Owens, 28, spends her days zigzagging across the country, speaking at GOP fundraisers and on college campuses as the communications director of Turning Points USA, the country’s most prominent and contentious conservative student group.

She became the new darling of President Donald Trump at lightning speed last month when a video of her berating black protesters at the University of California, Los Angeles, as “privileged Americans” obsessed with “shouting about slavery” went viral. Shortly after, rapper Kanye West tweeted, “I love the way Candace Owens thinks.”

Trump called in to “Fox and Friends” and said Owens was “the hottest thing out there right now.” And this month, Trump followed a 20-minute face-to-face meeting with Owens at the White House with a tweet about the “big impact” she was having on politics: “so good for our Country!” he wrote.

The plaudits she’s received from the right have been met with equal loathing from the left, which has called Owens out on social media, labeling her ""stupid,"" ""token"" and ""exclusively reactionary, rage fueled and hyper emotional.""

It’s been a stunning ascent for a person who now loudly advocates for Trump but didn’t vote for him, or anyone, in 2016. She didn't vote for Barack Obama in 2012, either.

“Yeah, I didn’t vote exactly,” Owens said in an interview with NBC News. “This is the first time I’ve been politically inclined and active, and I think Donald Trump is a tremendous president. And I wanted to be educated. I wanted to do a deep dive before I started going out there and saying stuff as opposed to other people who mindlessly vote.”

The platform

Owens’ conservative awakening embodies what the Republican Party hopes to see across the country — young people, minorities and women embracing the ideas of Trump’s America.

But she’s not doing that by softening any of the platform that has emerged on the far-right. Owens has called Black Lives Matter advocates “whiny toddlers,” advocated for the end of all welfare programs, and likened black Democrats to slaves on plantations.

For Owens, climate change is a lie used to “extract dollars from Americans,” abortion is the “extermination” of black babies, undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children should be immediately deported, and concern over rising white nationalism is “stupid,” an opinion she expressed after a white nationalist drove through a group of counterprotesters last summer in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a woman.

Owens cites George Soros and “globalists” among the country’s most looming threats and has called for the imprisonment of Hillary and Bill Clinton, former FBI director James Comey, special counsel Robert Mueller and the TV anchors Jake Tapper, Rachel Maddow and Anderson Cooper, among others.","YouTube tested, Trump approved: How Candace Owens suddenly became the loudest voice on the far right",http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/youtube-tested-trump-approved-how-candace-owens-suddenly-became-loudest-n885166

TEL AVIV — President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser said in an interview published Sunday that the administration will soon present its Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, with or without input from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

In an interview published in the Arabic language Al-Quds newspaper, Jared Kushner appealed directly to Palestinians and criticized Abbas, who has shunned the Trump team over its alleged pro-Israel bias, particularly on the fate of contested Jerusalem.

The interview came out after a weeklong trip around the region by Kushner and Mideast envoy Jason Greenblatt. The team met with leaders of Israel, Jordan, Qatar, Egypt and Saudi Arabia to discuss the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza and the administration’s proposals for a peace deal.

Palestinian leaders have blasted the Trump negotiating team in recent days.

It remains unclear how the U.S. would proceed with a peace plan without Palestinian cooperation.

Kushner said the plan is ""almost done,"" but offered scant details aside from the promise of economic prosperity. He made no mention of a Palestinian state arising alongside Israel, though he acknowledged that Arab partners support that goal.

Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat accused Kushner and Greenblatt on Saturday of trying to topple the Abbas-led West Bank autonomy government and dismantle the U.N. aid agency for Palestinian refugees. On Sunday, Erekat doubled down on his criticism, dismissing the American negotiators as biased and predicting their peace plan would fail.

""Kushner’s interview again illustrates the U.S. refusal to talk substance, to mention Palestinian rights or a Palestinian state,"" Erekat told NBC News in a statement released by his office. ""This is an attempt to push forward a plan that consolidates Israel’s colonial control over Palestinian land and lives while telling the Palestinian people that money will compensate for our inalienable rights.""

""Kushner represents a policy of dictation rather than negotiations,"" he added. ""It is the Trump Administration that has walked away from the negotiations, from international law and U.N. resolutions.""

Any peace plan would face major obstacles, including the increasingly dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, internal Palestinian divisions and recent cross-border violence between Gaza's Hamas rulers and Israel.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday that he met twice with Kushner and Greenblatt this weekend and discussed the peace process, regional issues and ""how to solve the humanitarian situation in Gaza without strengthening Hamas.""

""I must say that there was total support for our positions and actions to ensure the security of the State of Israel,"" Netanyahu said.

""I expressed great appreciation to President Trump, Secretary of State Pompeo and, of course, Ambassador Haley for the continuous and strong support at the U.N., which is truly very impressive.""",Kushner says Trump's 'deal of the century' Mideast peace plan will be unveiled soon,http://nbcnews.com/news/world/kushner-says-will-publish-trump-s-mideast-peace-plan-soon-n886096
422,422,,nbcnews.com,"The report found that the three right-leaning outlets during the period analyzed, between January and November 2017, published on average 384 articles per month — more than four times the amount put out by the four left-leaning ones.

Muslims, affirmative action and terrorism accounted for 57 percent of content on right-leaning accounts, compared to 47 percent on left-leaning ones, according to figures provided by Zhang.

But issues like health care, jobs and the economy took a backseat on right-leaning outlets, as opposed to what was published by their left-leaning counterparts, which had a more even distribution of topics, the study found.

SEPARATING FACT FROM FICTION

The veracity of what’s being published through official WeChat accounts and private groups is a growing source of concern for some.

Just like Facebook and Twitter, WeChat can feature content that’s been distorted, exaggerated or just plain false.

One space where this can happen is in private groups. WeChat allows users to create a group chat of up to 500 members, according to the company.

“The groups are really where the articles are shared and where discussions take place,” Zhang said.

One example of misinformation cited in the study involved reports in November warning WeChat readers of an impending civil war and mass riots led by ""Antifa.""

Short for “anti-fascist,” Antifa is a loosely organized coalition of protesters, left-wing activists, and self-described anarchists who vow to physically confront ""fascists"" — meaning anyone who espouses bigoted or totalitarian views.

Following President Donald Trump’s election, Antifa protesters have occasionally clashed with his supporters and white nationalist groups at demonstrations across the country.

To be sure, an Antifa-led civil war or mass riots never happened. Moreover, a recent search on WeChat showed that some articles did in fact counter the erroneous claims and urged users not to spread unfounded reports.

But the story, translated into Chinese, nonetheless propagated far and wide on WeChat, according to the report.

If you look at discourse on WeChat, conservatives are winning the messaging game

“This case illustrates how a conspiratorial idea that was relayed all the way from the English-language far-right by way of partisan outlets on WeChat could be amplified through the replication and multiplication of diffuse outlets eager for shareable content,” the report concluded.

Another source of concern for some is whether WeChat outlets translating and packaging the news have fact-checking mechanisms in place like those at established Chinese-language media in the U.S.

“Not only do they not have fact-checking or any traditional norms of journalism governing how they operate,” Zhang said, “there’s an incentive to editorialize and make the narrative, the story, more sensational than what they found on the Internet.”

Outlets do this, she said, to make themselves stand out from the pack.

Joe Wei, managing editor of The World Journal, a U.S.-based Chinese-language newspaper, said he believes the majority of WeChat content is translated and disseminated by people in China.

He said the goal is not to give readers a better understanding of what’s happening in the U.S., but rather to expose conflict in the country, in an effort to show that China is better than the U.S.

For his part, Wang, who runs the Chinese Americans for Trump private WeChat group, said he doesn’t believe WeChat is being used to give first-generation Chinese-Americans a distorted view of U.S. politics.

“People do their own fact-checking, big time,” he said. “We’re not just going to believe a link on a website, not from a critical source, saying whatever. Everybody does their critical thinking, independent research, and we encourage people to do that so they’re immune from the fake news media.”

Wang added that they have moderators who fact-check news that is shared. Action is taken when something is found to be amiss.

“People would point out a link, saying this is fake news, it didn’t happen, it’s not real, and we would all just stop spreading,” he said.

Wei, however, expressed concern over how the content of some WeChat outlets is curated.

Speaking in Mandarin, he said right-leaning and pro-Trump groups tend to select, or cherry pick, social issues for WeChat that first-generation Chinese Americans are familiar with.

Those have included opposition toward affirmative action, allegations of Asian-American admissions quotas at Harvard University, and laws requiring that education and healthcare data only for Asian Americans be broken down by ethnicity.

But other issues, like the questionable use of force by some police officers toward black men, may get short shrift or not be covered at all, according to Wei.

The common theme that resonates for many first-generation Chinese-American immigrants is a feeling of being discriminated against or marginalized, observers note.

And that, they say, has helped galvanize support through WeChat to rally around these issues.

A NEW MEDIUM FOR THE MESSAGE

These days, fewer first-generation Chinese-American immigrants appear to be getting their news from traditional sources, like print media, Wei said.

Instead, they’re turning to WeChat and the platform’s official accounts, personal groups and “Moments” section, where users share information with their friends.

Chinese-language print media in the U.S. will likely adjust in the coming years by shifting its focus more to local news, including on-the-ground reporting about life in Chinese-American communities and the difficulties residents face, Wei said.

Established Chinese ethnic media outlets, including The World Journal, have also responded by setting up their own official WeChat accounts.

“In the last few years, we have been investing tremendously, building up a news-information platform that includes website, social media, print and electronic newspaper,” Wei said of The World Journal.

To combat misinformation on WeChat, Zhang’s report said more English-language media, government agencies and community groups should use the platform for two-way communication.

And ethnic media, the report added, can serve as “vehicles of verified information,” even as WeChat seems to have garnered a sizeable audience.

“Substantial and credible local news is more crucial than ever for immigrant groups, especially on stories and policy issues prone to misinterpretation,” the report said.

In December 1992, Rowe lived about four miles from the apartment Mirack shared with a roommate. It's unclear if they knew each other.

Stedman recently hired a private company to use the DNA to search for relatives of the suspect, and that process identified Rowe.

""This killer was at liberty from this crime, this brutal crime, for longer than Christy Mirack was on this earth alive,"" Stedman said at a news conference. ""And they steered us in the path of holding him finally accountable.""

An undercover operation at an elementary school where he was performing on May 31 as DJ Freez produced a water bottle and gum he had used, and state police subsequently established an alleged genetic match.

Rowe was arrested at his home Monday and charged with criminal homicide. Court records did not identify a defense attorney, and a message left at his DJ business was not immediately returned.

Authorities said Mirack was found wearing a coat and gloves, suggesting she was about to leave her home when she was killed. A wooden cutting board, believed to have been used to attack her, was found by her body.

The principal of her elementary school, concerned Mirack had not shown up for work four days before Christmas and was not answering calls, discovered the body on her living room floor and called 911.

424,424,,nbcnews.com,"Another lawyer, John Manly, who filed many of the lawsuits against MSU that resulted in an historic settlement, has 20 clients who have signed onto a lawsuit against USC and has spoken to more than 100 other women.

Several other complaints have been filed by other firms, and there's even a class-action suit. And following the MSU trajectory, the U.S. Department of Education has opened an investigation into USC, police are investigating Tyndall, and the college president was forced to resign.

NBC News has not been able to reach Tyndall, but he previously defended himself to The Los Angeles Times, saying his exams were thorough but not sexual.

He said that before the newspaper's initial report on him, he knew of only one patient complaint, for not wearing gloves during a pelvic exam — which he said was false.

USC has said that a 2013 investigation of Tyndall for making a racial comment uncovered ""insufficient evidence"" that university policy had been violated.

After a health center staffer lodged another complaint in 2016, USC discovered that there had been eight other complaints — including one report that ""he gave me the skeevies"" — that were handled by his direct boss and not revealed to university leadership, the school said.

Solar panels will be a required feature on virtually every new home built in California, under a policy advanced Wednesday by California regulators — again putting the state in the forefront of government controls over climate-warming carbon emissions.

The California Energy Commission voted unanimously, 5-0, to recommend energy efficiency standards that are set to be added to state building regulations later this year, effecting all construction after Jan. 1, 2020. The rules will make California the first state in the nation to require solar panels on new homes.

""This will be nothing short of historic for our state and for our country,"" said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar & Storage Association, an industry group. ""California is once again betting on the sun and putting real policy behind grand vision.""

The requirement will apply to single-family homes and to apartment and condominium complexes of three stories or less. Solar installations have become so cost effective that they are included in more than 15,000 homes built each year in California, even without the directive from the state. In 2020 and beyond that number promises to increase to 80,000, the number of homes built each year in the Golden State.

Crucial in moving the proposal forward was a finding that solar power would be cost effective in all climate zones in the state. The average estimated cost of a solar system is $9,500, or $40 a month when amortized over a 30-year mortgage. But the systems are projected to save customers an average of $80 a month on their utility bills.",California becomes first state to require solar panels on new homes,http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-becomes-first-state-require-solar-panels-new-homes-n872531

A federal judge in California on Friday declined to immediately impose an order barring Stormy Daniels’ attorney from publicly sharing his opinions about the guilt of President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen.

An attorney for Cohen, in a motion filed Thursday, sought to bar Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenatti from commenting on a civil case filed by Daniels, the adult film actress who is seeking to invalidate a non-disclosure agreement stemming from a sexual relationship she says she had with Trump over a decade ago.

The White House and Cohen have denied that Trump had an affair with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.

Judge S. James Otero of U.S. District Court in Los Angeles ruled that Cohen’s motion did not demonstrate “that immediate, irreparable injury"" would occur without the gag order, and set a briefing schedule for late this month and early July, according to court documents.

Clifford is seeking to invalidate the non-disclosure agreement she signed in exchange for $130,000 paid by Cohen a month before the 2016 presidential election.

The motion filed by Cohen's attorney, Brent Blakely, claimed that Avenatti's frequent media appearances and tweets could deprive Cohen of his right to a fair trial in the civil case.

Former federal prosecutor and NBC News analyst Chuck Rosenberg said on MSNBC Friday that he agrees with the reasoning behind Cohen's motion.

""What Mr. Cohen was trying to do — and it makes sense to me — is to prevent people like Mr. Avenatti from talking publicly and often about a case in which Mr. Cohen is a party,"" Rosenberg said.

""Courts take very seriously the idea that everyone gets a fair trial. And so that's what Mr. Cohen was trying to achieve. I don't blame him, and I imagine the judge will eventually hear this on its merits,"" he said.

On Twitter Friday, Avenatti announced the judge’s order. Earlier Friday, he tweeted that “for over 12 yrs, Mr. Cohen and his boss Mr. Trump have routinely tried to 'shut people up' and hide the truth through intimidation & threats,” and that ""the motion is right out of their playbook.""

A footnote in the judge’s Friday order says that orders like the kind sought ""are solely for extraordinary relief and are discouraged,"" because ex parte applications, brought by one party to a legal matter without representation from the opposing party, ""throw the system out of whack.""",Judge declines to order Avenatti to stop talking about Cohen case,http://nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/judge-declines-order-avenatti-stop-talking-about-cohen-case-n883816

A Texas man who plead guilty to stealing more than $1.2 million in fajitas while acting as a public servant has been sentenced to 50 years in prison.

Gilberto Escamilla, 53, was employed at the Darrel B. Hester Juvenile Detention Center in San Benito, Texas, until August 2017 — when it was discovered that he had been placing orders for fajitas using county funds and then selling them for his own profit since December 2008, according to Cameron County Court filings.

When sentenced on Friday, Escamilla was also served with the maximum fine of $10,000 on top of the $1,251,578.72 he was ordered to pay back for the cost of the fajitas, officials said.

According to The Brownsville Herald, Escamilla's scheme unraveled last August after a delivery driver with Labatt Food Service phoned the detention center to give kitchen employees a heads up that an 800-pound delivery of fajitas had arrived.

Employees immediately thought the delivery to be suspicious as minors at the detention center are not served fajitas, however the delivery driver insisted that had been delivering fajitas to the detention center's kitchen for the past nine years.

After being fired and arrested, Escamilla's house was searched by police, who found packages of the fajitas in his refrigerator.

""It was selfish. It started small and got bigger and out of control,"" Escamilla said during court testimony, according to the Herald. ""It got to the point where I couldn't control it anymore.""

Texas State District Judge J. Manuel Banales, who handed down the sentence, dismissed an additional theft charge as part of an earlier plea deal made by Escamilla. Because Escamilla stole more than $200,000 worth of goods, Texas law considers the crime to be a first degree felony and allows for a sentencing of up to 99 years in prison. It also allows for a more severe punishment if the defendant commits a crime while acting as a public servant.

TIJUANA, Mexico — Tijuana was once known as a red-light district, watering hole and gambling magnet for Southern California. In recent years, it's grown to a city of 1.8 million people with thriving arts, music and culinary scenes — but lately that's been overshadowed by a surge of violence.

Last year, the city just across the southern border saw a Mexico-leading 1,744 homicides, an all-time high, according to the Baja California Attorney General’s Office.

""Dateline"" visited Tijuana to explore the impact of that violence and why it had not spread across the U.S. border to San Diego.

While President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that he wants to build a southern border wall to keep crime at bay, the most blood-soaked city in Mexico is sending very little, if any, of its violence to its northern neighbor, experts say.

“It doesn’t bleed over,” says Everard Meade, director of the Trans Border Institute at the University of San Diego. “These two cities are really close, but large segments never cross the border.”

San Diego, the second largest city in California saw only 35 murders in 2017, a 30 percent decrease compared to 2016. The homicide number is reflective of near 40-year lows for murder seen during much of the decade, according to police data.

One reason is that the border region is fortified with hundreds of law enforcers from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and the U.S. Coast Guard. The FBI has a Cross Border Task Force that has thwarted cartel crime through wiretaps and GPS tracking, said the U.S. Attorney in San Diego, Adam Braverman.","Despite Trump's fears, Tijuana's record violence rarely enters San Diego",http://nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/despite-trump-s-fears-tijuana-s-record-violence-rarely-enters-n885586

In less than a year, Candace Owens has gone from a rising political YouTube personality to one of the leading faces — and voices — of the conservative effort to win back the votes of young and minority Americans.

Owens, 28, spends her days zigzagging across the country, speaking at GOP fundraisers and on college campuses as the communications director of Turning Points USA, the country’s most prominent and contentious conservative student group.

She became the new darling of President Donald Trump at lightning speed last month when a video of her berating black protesters at the University of California, Los Angeles, as “privileged Americans” obsessed with “shouting about slavery” went viral. Shortly after, rapper Kanye West tweeted, “I love the way Candace Owens thinks.”

Trump called in to “Fox and Friends” and said Owens was “the hottest thing out there right now.” And this month, Trump followed a 20-minute face-to-face meeting with Owens at the White House with a tweet about the “big impact” she was having on politics: “so good for our Country!” he wrote.

The plaudits she’s received from the right have been met with equal loathing from the left, which has called Owens out on social media, labeling her ""stupid,"" ""token"" and ""exclusively reactionary, rage fueled and hyper emotional.""

It’s been a stunning ascent for a person who now loudly advocates for Trump but didn’t vote for him, or anyone, in 2016. She didn't vote for Barack Obama in 2012, either.

“Yeah, I didn’t vote exactly,” Owens said in an interview with NBC News. “This is the first time I’ve been politically inclined and active, and I think Donald Trump is a tremendous president. And I wanted to be educated. I wanted to do a deep dive before I started going out there and saying stuff as opposed to other people who mindlessly vote.”

The platform

Owens’ conservative awakening embodies what the Republican Party hopes to see across the country — young people, minorities and women embracing the ideas of Trump’s America.

But she’s not doing that by softening any of the platform that has emerged on the far-right. Owens has called Black Lives Matter advocates “whiny toddlers,” advocated for the end of all welfare programs, and likened black Democrats to slaves on plantations.

For Owens, climate change is a lie used to “extract dollars from Americans,” abortion is the “extermination” of black babies, undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children should be immediately deported, and concern over rising white nationalism is “stupid,” an opinion she expressed after a white nationalist drove through a group of counterprotesters last summer in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a woman.

Owens cites George Soros and “globalists” among the country’s most looming threats and has called for the imprisonment of Hillary and Bill Clinton, former FBI director James Comey, special counsel Robert Mueller and the TV anchors Jake Tapper, Rachel Maddow and Anderson Cooper, among others.","YouTube tested, Trump approved: How Candace Owens suddenly became the loudest voice on the far right",http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/youtube-tested-trump-approved-how-candace-owens-suddenly-became-loudest-n885166

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Protesters angered by Iran's cratering economy confronted police in front of Parliament on Monday, with security forces firing tear gas, according to online videos, the first such confrontation after similar demonstrations rocked the country at the start of the year.

The unplanned demonstration came a day after protests forced two major shopping centers for mobile phones and electonics to close in Tehran and after demonstrators earlier closed its Grand Bazaar.

It signaled widespread unease in the wake of President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers and to restore sanctions on the country.

It wasn't immediately clear who led the protests. Iran's semi-official news agencies, Fars, ISNA and Tasnim, described the protests at the Grand Bazaar as having erupted after the Iranian rial dropped to 90,000 to the U.S. dollar on the country's black market, despite government attempts to control the currency rate.

Videos posted to social media showed protesters at the bazaar heckling shopkeepers who refused to close, shouting in Farsi: ""Coward!""

A short time later, videos shared by Iranians on social media appeared to show a crowd confronting police at Parliament, about a mile from the Grand Bazaar. The videos show what appears to be tear gas in the air and protesters screaming, ""They attacked us with tear gas!"" Another man is heard shouting: ""Come back!""

Other videos appeared to show police charging into the crowd.

State media in Iran didn't immediately report the Grand Bazaar demonstration. Only Fars reported on the Parliament protest, which it described only as an incident in which shopkeepers asked lawmakers to ""stop rising prices.""

Tasnim later quoted the head of Iran's Chamber of Guilds, Ali Fazeli, as saying the situation at the bazaar was calm.

""Their demands are delivered through the chamber to the government, and these are being pursued by us,"" he said.

Tehran's sprawling Grand Bazaar has long been a center of conservatism in Iranian politics, and it remains an economic force within the country — despite the construction of massive malls around the city. Bazaar families opposed the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and supported the 1979 Islamic Revolution that replaced him with a Shiite theocracy and elected officials.",Iran protests broaden as U.S. sanctions takes toll on the economy,http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-protests-broaden-u-s-sanctions-takes-toll-economy-n886461

LONDON — One of Israel’s largest tech firms has announced a boycott of national airline El Al after it once again moved female customers away from ultra-Orthodox Jewish men despite a court ruling against the practice.

Barak Eilam, CEO of Ra’anana-based software company NICE Systems, said his company would not fly with the Israeli flag-carrier until it changed its “practice and actions discriminating [against] women.”

""At NICE we don't do business with companies that discriminate against race, gender or religion,"" he wrote on LinkedIn.

It comes after a passenger at Kennedy Airport on El Al's New York-Tel Aviv flight on Friday night saw four ultra-Orthodox men refuse to take their assigned seats because they were next to women.

The witness, Khen Rotem, posted on Facebook that the plane’s departure was delayed while male flight attendants at first tried to force the men to sit down, then asked women to move until the stand-off was resolved.

One of the men was so devout that he boarded the plane with his eyes closed in an apparent effort to avoid looking at any woman on board, Rotem said.

While the flight attendants were busy “putting personal practice of faith ahead of individual rights and civil order,” the flight missed its turn for take-off and departed one-and-a-quarter hours late, Rotem wrote.

The incident took place almost a year to the day after a landmark ruling by an Israeli court that airline employees cannot ask female passengers to move seats to accommodate men.

The case was brought against El Al by Renee Rabinowitz, an 82-year-old who fled the Nazis during World War II and who was asked to move seats on a 2015 flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Tel Aviv.

Jerusalem Magistrates Court ordered El Al to set up a procedure for similar occurrences in future and awarded Rabinowitz the equivalent of $1,834 in damages.

El Al did not respond to a request for comment, but in a statement Sunday, reported by The Associated Press, it apologized and said it does its utmost to serve a ""wide array of populations and travelers.""

The Israel Religious Action Center, a progressive group that led last year's case, was also unavailable for comment but asked passengers to report any similar cases. “If you have witnessed or experienced illegal gender segregation, please report the incident to us, and we will take action,” it said on Facebook.

435,435,,www.nbcnews.com,"The children of men currently in U.S. immigration detention centers plan to travel to the nation’s capitol Tuesday to meet with federal lawmakers amid debate over the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy that separated parents and children at the southern border.

“The message we want to send is that finally people have recognized that keeping families together ought to be the baseline of all conversations about immigration reform,” said the Rev. Seth Kaper-Dale, co-pastor of the New Jersey-based Reformed Church of Highland Park, who organized the trip.

Kaper-Dale — who has offered his church as a sanctuary to immigrants, including Indonesians, in fear of deportation — said much of the recent attention has been focused on family separations at the border.

“This country ought to be concerned about kids beings separated in the interior of the country too,” he added.

Kaper-Dale said he plans to travel Tuesday to D.C. with seven children, ages 9 to 16, and rally first in the morning at the Supreme Court. Later, they are slated to visit with members of Congress from New Jersey, including Sens. Cory Booker and Bob Menendez, as well as Rep. Frank Pallone, all Democrats.

“We know that the congressional solutions will take a long time...and we’d like the Supreme Court to find a way to stop the bleeding, if you will, and help families immediately,” Kaper-Dale said.

Part of the group are children of Roby Sangr and Gunawan Liem, both from Indonesia, the reverend said. The pair was picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in January. Each had overstayed his tourist visa and had not applied for asylum within the required time, according to Kaper-Dale.

He said the men are ethnic Chinese Christians who fled Indonesia in the mid-to-late ‘90s to escape the the collapse of the Suharto regime, which experienced cronyism and corruption. A large group ended up settling in central New Jersey.

Sangr and Liem do not have criminal records, Kaper-Dale said.

The American Civil Liberties Union, who in February won a temporary restraining order halting their deportations, said courts have ruled that persecution or torture is a risk that Christians, especially of Chinese descent, would encounter in Indonesia.

U.S. law prohibits removal of people who would likely face persecution or torture, according to the ACLU.

The church’s D.C. trip comes as debate over immigration grips the nation.

President Donald Trump last week signed an executive order reversing his administration's policy of separating children from their parents at the border and allowing families to instead be detained together.

Trump said the order ""will solve that problem"" of children being separated from their parents, though it would not end his administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy of charging everyone who attempts to cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.

As of June 20, there were 2,053 separated minors being cared for in facilities funded by the Department of Health and Human Services, according to a Department of Homeland Security statement released June 23. Customs and Border Protection had reunited 522 children separated from adults as part of the zero-tolerance policy, the release said.

But in some recent cases, families that have already laid down roots in the U.S. have also been broken up as immigrant family members, for various reasons, have been taken into custody by immigration agents.

Sangr and Liem are all being held in ICE detention centers in New Jersey, Kaper-Dale said.

He said he hopes elected officials come up with a real immigration solution.

“These are not kids who are used to speaking to the media or speaking to lawmakers, but they are quickly figuring out that what they have left right now is their voice — and they have to use it,” the reverend said.

A ship carrying hundreds of migrants was stuck at sea Monday after Italy and the small Mediterranean island nation of Malta both refused to allow the rescue vessel to dock.

Aid group SOS Mediterranee said the 629 passengers aboard the Aquarius had been caught up in a crackdown promoted by the right-wing partner in Italy's new populist government, which has vowed to stop the country from becoming the ""refugee camp of Europe.""

Those aboard the ship included 400 people picked up by the Italian navy, that country's coast guard and private cargo ships who were transferred onto the vessel. The crew of the Aquarius also pulled 229 migrants from the water or from traffickers' unseaworthy boats Saturday night, including 123 unaccompanied minors and seven pregnant women.

Later, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said his country would take in the migrants.

""It is our obligation to help avoid a humanitarian catastrophe and offer a 'safe harbor' to these people,"" Spain's presidential office said in a statement.

Malta earlier said the rescue operations took place in international waters off Libya and were coordinated by Italy.

Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte had said he personally contacted Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat, to ""take on the human assistance of persons in difficulty aboard the Aquarius.""

But Muscat, ""while comprehending the situation,"" rebuffed him, Conte said in a Facebook post late Sunday.

Like Malta, Italy didn't appear to be budging.

Italy's firebrand interior minister, Matteo Salvini, who leads the anti-immigrant League party in the governing coalition, has long railed against what he depicts as Europe's failure to show solidarity with Italy during the migrant crisis in recent years.

""Starting today, Italy, too, begins to say NO to the trafficking of human beings, NO to the business of clandestine immigration,"" Salvini tweeted Sunday.

More than 600,000 migrants have reached Italy by boat from Africa in the past five years. Numbers have dropped dramatically in recent months, but rescues have increased in recent days.

After leading an hours-long meeting with his coalition leaders Sunday night at the premier's office, Conte said Italy was sending two motorboats with medical staff aboard in case the migrants needed help. He made no mention of whether or when the Aquarius might be permitted to get into port.

Salvini and Italian Transportation Minister Danilo Toninelli, who is part of the 5-Star Movement faction in the new government, said in a joint statement Sunday that it was Malta's responsibility to ""open its ports for the hundreds of the rescued on the NGO ship Aquarius.""

""The island can't continue to turn the other way,"" the ministers said. ""The Mediterranean is the sea of all the countries that face it, and it (Malta) can't imagine that Italy will continue to face this giant phenomenon in solitude.""

Earlier, Malta said in a statement that the Aquarius took on the passengers in waters controlled by Libya and where Italian authorities in Rome coordinate search-and-rescue operations.

The Maltese Rescue Coordination Center ""is neither the competent nor the coordinating authority,"" the statement said.

SOS Mediterranean spokeswoman Mathilde Auvillain told The Associated Press the ship was ""heading north following instructions received after the rescues and transfers"" Saturday night. The Rome-based rescue coordination center gave the instructions.

The aid group said in a statement it had taken ""good note"" of Salvini's stance, as reported earlier by Italian media. It added that the Aquarius ""is still waiting for definitive instructions regarding the port of safety.""

SOS Mediterranee said Maltese search-and-rescue authorities were contacted by their Italian counterparts ""to find the best solution for the well-being and safety"" of the people on the ship.

Human rights groups oppose returning rescued migrants to Libya, where many are held in inhumane conditions, poorly fed and often forced to do slave labor.

Libya was plunged into chaos following a 2011 uprising. The lawlessness in Libya has made it a popular place for migrants to try to depart for Europe.

Driven by violent conflicts and extreme poverty, hundreds of thousands of migrants have reached southern Europe in recent years by crossing the Mediterranean with the help of smugglers.

The United Nations says at least 785 migrants have died crossing the sea so far this year.","Spain steps in after Italy, Malta close ports to hundreds of migrants",http://nbcnews.com/news/world/hundreds-migrants-stranded-mediterranean-italy-malta-close-ports-n881866

As the move was announced, Roman Catholic Church officials in New Jersey revealed that McCarrick, 87, also had been accused of sexual misconduct by adults three times in the past. Two of those accusations resulted in secret settlements, officials said.

In a written statement, McCarrick said he was ""shocked"" when he learned of the allegation involving a minor some months ago and supported a thorough investigation by the police and the Archdiocese of New York, where he was working as a priest when the abuse allegedly occurred.

BEIJING — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is making a two-day visit to Beijing starting Tuesday and is expected to discuss with Chinese leaders his next steps after last week's nuclear summit with President Donald Trump.

Kim's visit to Beijing is one way for China to highlight its crucial role in U.S. efforts to get North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. The U.S. has long looked to China to use its influence with North Korea to bring it to negotiations, but the visit comes as ties between Beijing and Washington are being tested by a major trade dispute.

Chinese President Xi Jinping ""is exerting a lot of influence from behind the scenes,"" said Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Glaser said it was predictable Xi would want to be briefed by Kim directly about the North Korean leader's talks with Trump.

""I expect they will talk about the path going forward and where priorities should lie,"" Glaser said. Those priorities, from China's perspective, would be to ensure that Beijing is included in any in peace treaty talks and for creating an environment on the Korean Peninsula that will make it unnecessary for U.S. troops to remain.

Kim was diplomatically isolated for years before making his first foreign trip as leader in March to meet with Xi in Beijing. This would be his third visit to China, North Korea's main ally and key source of trade and economic assistance. Following his summit with Trump, Kim was expected to meet with Chinese leaders to discuss progress in halting his country's missile and nuclear weapons programs in exchange for economic incentives.

The Singapore meeting resulted in a surprise announcement of a U.S. suspension of military drills with its South Korean ally, a goal long pursued by Beijing and Pyongyang. That move is seen as potentially weakening defenses and diplomacy among America's Asian allies, while bolstering China and Russia.",Kim Jong Un visits China for third time since March,http://nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/kim-jong-un-visits-china-third-time-march-n884576

MILWAUKEE — Newspaper publishers across the U.S. already strapped by years of declining revenue say they're dealing with an existential threat: Recently imposed tariffs on Canadian newsprint driving up their business costs.

The tariffs are a response to a complaint to the U.S. Department of Commerce from a hedge fund-owned paper producer in Washington state, which argues that its Canadian competitors are taking advantage of government subsidies to sell their product at unfairly low prices. The tariffs, imposed in January and increased in March, are not permanent yet. But newspaper publishers are bracing for another blow to an industry that has shrunk with the loss of advertising revenue to the internet.

Critics of the paper tariffs say the businesses that will ultimately be harmed are not Canadian paper producers, but U.S. newspapers that will have to cut staff and reduce publication days to afford higher prices of newsprint — the sheets newspapers are printed on. The newspaper industry employs just over 150,000 Americans, which is about 276,000, or 65 percent, fewer than two decades ago.

""To get an unbudgeted increase of this magnitude will be for many publishers very, very serious to catastrophic,"" said Tom Slaughter, the executive director of the Inland Press Association, which represents about 1,500 daily and non-daily newspapers in every state.

A large metro newspaper can expect annual increases of about $3 million in printing costs, according to Paul Boyle, senior vice president for the News Media Alliance. While larger papers might be able to survive the increase, Boyle said smaller publications might not.

""I've heard from small publishers who've said, 'I'm worried about shutting my doors,'"" he said.

Boyle said his organization — formerly called the Newspaper Association of America — is compiling a survey from its member and nearly every publisher is exploring layoffs and scaling back news coverage.

Steve Stewart, publisher of The State Journal in Frankfort, Kentucky, told readers in a March 30 column that the newspaper they were reading cost 10 percent more to produce than a few weeks earlier and could cost as much as 40 percent more in a few months. He said this will result in fewer pages, higher subscription costs and less local content.

The newsprint tariffs reflect President Donald Trump's tough new approach to U.S. trade relations. Trump is engaged in a tense standoff with China over Beijing's sharp-elbowed attempts to gain access to U.S. technology. He's trying to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. And his administration has wrangled with Canada directly over low-priced Canadian timber imports, Canadian barriers to U.S. dairy farmers, and now cheap Canadian newsprint.

The International Trade Commission is expected to make a final determination on the tariffs in August or September.

Canadian newsprint producers began paying an average of 6.53 percent more to export their products to the U.S. in January, when the Commerce Department concluded that would help offset the foreign paper mills' advantage over American companies. In March, the department increased the cost by another 22 percent after its preliminary investigation concluded that one Canadian company, British Columbia-based Catalyst, was underselling the uncoated groundwood paper newspapers use by that much less.

In response to the second increase, Catalyst said the tariff was ""without merit"" and that it ""will continue to vigorously defend itself against an unwarranted and onerous U.S. trade action.""

The North Pacific Paper Company, which New York hedge fund One Rock Capital Partners bought in 2016, petitioned for the tariffs, arguing that Canadian companies had an unfair advantage. NORPAC, which employs about 300 people, is the only U.S. paper producer making that argument.

""While our company understands the concerns recently surfaced by some newspaper publishers, which also face a challenging marketplace, we strongly disagree with the notion that their industry requires low-priced, subsidized newsprint from Canada to sustain their own business model,"" Craig Annenberg, the CEO of NORPAC, said in a statement. The statement went on to say that ""high-quality journalism in communities across the country should not depend on unfairly traded inputs that cause material injury to a U.S. industry and American jobs.""

The U.S. currently has five operating mills, including NORPAC. Three are in Washington state, with one of them partly owned by a Canadian company. Canada owns the remaining two in Georgia and Mississippi.

Publishers say Canadian imports are not the reason for the decline of U.S.-based paper mills, but rather a 75 percent drop in newsprint consumption over the last two decades. That has led mills to switch to more profitable products such as the boxes Amazon uses for shipping, said Tony Smithson, vice president of printing operations at Bliss Communications, which owns multiple newspapers and radio stations in Wisconsin. The newsprint the company buys all comes from Canada.

Smithson said that even if every paper mill in the U.S. operated at full capacity, they still would only be able to produce about 60 percent of the newsprint consumed in the country. He said that raises another concern: A scarcity of available newsprint if Canadian producers decide to ship to other countries to avoid the new tariffs.",U.S. publishers worry about pricier newsprint with new tariffs,http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-publishers-worry-about-pricier-newsprint-new-tariffs-n865416

Paul Manafort may be in the VIP cell at a Virginia jail — the same one where ex-NFL star Michael Vick once did time — but the superintendent said he is not getting any ""special privileges.""

President Donald Trump's former campaign chair was locked up at the Northern Neck Regional Jail in rural Warsaw on Friday, after a judge revoked his bail amid allegations of witness-tampering.

The jail's online database listed Manafort's name and inmate number and showed he was assigned to the ""VIP-1"" housing unit in the 500-bed facility.

Superintendent Ted Hull told NBC News that was a mistake: He usually keeps information about high-profile inmates under wraps. And by Monday morning, Manafort's name had vanished from the list.

But Hull was still getting calls from concerned citizens.

""I've probably gotten a dozen calls — people saying, 'I want to know why he's in VIP!'"" the jail chief said.

""All that is is a name and number,"" Hull said. ""It's a small, fully functional, self-contained cell unit for high-profile inmates.""

A regular unit would have between eight and 16 cells with a common shower and dayroom, Hull said. But the VIP unit has everything in one place for a single inmate.

Hull would not discuss what kind of clothing Manafort is allowed to wear or any details of his routines. He wouldn't even discuss an ordinary inmate's routines and restrictions, because he didn't want that information attributed to Manafort, he said.

445,445,,nbcnews.com,"MEXICO CITY — State police have detained and disarmed the entire police force of a town in western Mexico where a mayoral candidate was killed on Thursday.

Video of the detention aired by local media showed uniformed officers hitting each other as gunshots go off in the background.

The Michoacán state police force said ""all the officers of the Ocampo municipal police force were detained for [an] internal affairs investigation.""

In statements on its Twitter account Sunday, the state police department did not directly tie the detentions to the Thursday killing of Fernando Angeles Juarez, the mayoral candidate for the leftist Democratic Revolution Party. He was killed in Ocampo, Michoacán on Thursday.

Angeles Juárez's is just one of at least 18 candidates killed so far in campaigns leading up to the July 1 elections. Just last week, another mayoral candidate was also gunned down last week in the conflict-ridden rural town of Aguililla in the western state of Michoacan.

Michoacán Gov. Silvano Aureoles vowed to catch those responsible for killing candidate Omar Gómez Lucatero.

Almost all of the 18 candidates killed across the country so far have been running for local posts in the July 1 elections, which will also decide the presidency, governorships and Congress. Other politicians who were considering a run have been killed before they could even register as candidates. The killings have particularly hit states like Michoacán, Guerrero and Oaxaca.

Mexican security analyst Alejandro Hope said that in part, the level of violence against candidates can be explained by “simple mathematics:” There are far more elections being held simultaneously than ever before in Mexico. With more than 3,400 local, state and federal posts at stake, there are more than 15,000 candidates hitting the campaign trail.

“Secondly, this speaks to the changes in criminal groups,” Hope said, noting that drug cartels have expanded into extortion, fuel theft and other crimes. “With the evolution of crime, it becomes much more important to gain control over territory, over local governments.”

In crimes like fuel theft, for example, local police can be valuable allies to act as look outs or cover up for illegal pipeline taps and illicit fuel warehouses. And some gangs have even taken to extorting money from local governments by forcing them to sign inflated public works contracts.

Those concerns could lead the gangs to kill a candidate who rivals their favorite, or to kill candidates who refuse their demands.

Finally, Hope noted, “there has been a breakdown in the management of disputes,” largely in rural areas, where turf wars between rival gangs have heated up, even as the government has become over-extended and less able to intervene.

“I looked in my camera’s viewfinder [and] I saw the girl running from black smoke,” Ut recalled. I say “Why isn’t she wearing clothes?” And I run and take a lot of pictures of her.”

After seeing the burns on Phúc’s back and arms, Ut says he poured water on her wounds and carried her to his car. It was only when he showed hospital officials his press pass that he was able to get Phúc and the other children injured that day treated.

447,447,,www.nbcnews.com,"Warning: This article includes spoilers for Season 2, Episode 10 of ""The Handmaid's Tale.""

The writer behind one of the most talked-about episodes of “The Handmaid’s Tale” had no idea how relevant the episode would end up being until it was released Wednesday.

In the episode, “The Last Ceremony,” June/Offred (Elisabeth Moss) is briefly reunited with her daughter, Hannah (Jordana Blake), who was initially taken from her in the series’ pilot, only to be separated from her again.

By Wednesday, the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border had been dominating news headlines for days.

“It’s unbelievable and uncanny,” said the episode writer, Yahlin Chang, who has also worked as a line producer for the Emmy-winning show. “I wish we could watch this show and be like ‘Wow! That’s crazy. That would never happen in America. We would never separate children from their mothers.’”

Before writing the episode, Chang said, she did extensive research, including interviewing social workers, child psychologists and experts at the U.N. to understand the psychology behind what happens when a child is forcibly separated from a parent.

“This usually happens in countries very far in totalitarian regimes, so I got a lot of stories from there,” Chang said. “The U.N. expert told me how the parents who are saying goodbye to their kids and who are being hauled away usually walk away smiling because they want the last image that their child has to be a positive one.”

Chang added that in her research, the U.N. expert told her that children might feel anger and resentment because all they know is that they want a parent who is no longer there.

As a mother, Chang said she felt a personal connection to this episode as well. “I have a 7- and 9-year-old so I just imagined what it would be like being in these scenarios with them. I thought about what I would say, what they would say, how they would react. I know what kids that age sound like — at least my kids — and that helped in terms of keeping my scenes true and authentic.”

“The Handmaid’s Tale,” which premiered on Hulu in 2017, earned eight Emmy Awards and two Golden Globes in its first season. Adapted from Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel of the same name, the show takes place in a fictional totalitarian society that used to be a part of the United States and is ruled by a fundamentalist regime facing environmental disasters and a plummeting birth rate. Because of this, women are treated as properties of the state and the few remaining fertile women are forced into sexual servitude.

Critics have also praised “The Handmaid’s Tale” for being timely and relevant to today’s society, and Chang added that being able to work on the show at this time has been a privilege.

“It’s amazing hearing about and seeing women from all over the world who are making their own handmaids’ costumes,"" she said, adding that her own perspective as a woman has helped her tap into the characters’ minds and motivations. “It helps when spinning out a dystopian narrative of what happens down the road if you begin to strip women of having control of their own bodies, if you strip women of their agency or strip them of their reproductive rights. What is the nightmare scenario that could ensue? What are the consequences of actions like this?”

Chang said she’s glad that the latest episode has sparked conversations, and hopes that it can also lead to changing public perception on certain issues.

“If people can watch this show and find themselves emotionally wrapped in these scenes,"" Chang said, ""that’s empathy they can translate out into the world toward real parents and kids who are separated and need to somehow find their way back to each other.

“If this episode in particular reminds people of the innate compassion they would feel toward these families, I would be so happy.”

JERUSALEM — Prince William started his busy Israel tour Tuesday with a visit to Jerusalem's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.

William arrived Monday night in the first-ever official visit by a member of the British royal family to the tumultuous region London once ruled.

The Duke is set to meet two survivors who escaped Nazi Germany for the safety of Britain. The memorial has recognized Prince William's great-grandmother, Princess Alice, as part of the Righteous Among the Nations for her role in rescuing Jews during the Holocaust.

Yad Vashem said Princess Alice ""hid the three members of the Cohen family — Rachel, Tilda and Michelle — in her palace in Athens during the Nazi occupation of Greece.""

It said: ""Princess Alice personally saw to it that the members of the persecuted Jewish family had everything they needed, and even visited them in their hiding place, spending many hours in their company.""

Thanks to her, the Cohen family survived and today lives in France, it said.

The princess died in 1969 and in 1988 her remains were brought to Jerusalem.

In a private 1994 visit to Yad Vashem, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, planted a tree there in his mother's honor.

Yad Vashem Chairman Avner Shalev is guiding Prince William through the memorial's exhibitions detailing the death of 6 million Jews systematically killed by Nazi Germany and its collaborators during World War II.

Though the trip is being billed as non-political, and places a special emphasis on technology and joint Israeli-Arab projects, William will also be meeting with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and visiting landmark Jerusalem sites at the heart of the century-old conflict.

Three decades of British rule between the two world wars helped establish some of the fault lines of today's Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Britain's withdrawal in 1948 led to the eventual establishment of Israel and Jordan.

Britain has since taken a back seat to the United States in mediating peace efforts, and the royal family has mostly steered clear of the region's toxic politics.

449,449,,nbcnews.com,"When designer Alexander Wang released his latest collection, his goal was to not just tell his family’s immigration story, but also to change how the fashion industry sold clothes.

I wanted to take the idea of my roots and put it into all these things — a singular narrative that felt very much true to who I am today.

So Wang did something unconventional: He hosted a show on June 3 — three months ahead of the next scheduled New York Fashion Week, which take place in February and September each year.

He also rebranded his company’s logo and called his new release “Collection 1” instead of the typical “spring/summer” or “fall/winter.”

“It’s not a time of tradition, but innovation,” Wang said. “Seasonality didn’t feel relevant in terms of titling a collection by a season or showing as a part of a fashion week that was labeled under a specific season.”

The designs from this collection, which Wang calls “immigrant Americana,” combined his parents’ immigrant experience with Wang’s upbringing in the U.S. Angela Weiss / AFP - Getty Images

Because his label’s peak sales are in June, Wang said it made sense to have a show that month and deliver the collection by the end of October. “Collection 2” is scheduled to have a show in December, he added, and that pattern is expected go on in years to come.

Wang said he knew there would be risk involved with leaving New York Fashion Week and showing at a time when editors and influencers who usually attend their shows might not be present. But he was confident he could put together something special.

“We felt with social media and the way information is communicated, we could make this experience something that is truly unique for everyone there and for people that were live streaming it,” Wang said. “I wanted it to feel like they were all sharing that moment together.”

To inspire his first collection outside traditional timing, Wang looked at his parents’ journey from China to the U.S. and how it was intertwined with his own experience.

Wang’s parents, older brother, and older sister first came to the States in 1973 but didn’t know a word of English, Wang said. They had come for his uncle’s wedding and decided to establish a life in the country.

Everything from going to the grocery store and figuring out how how to shop for food to learning how to look for a job was a new experience for them, Wang added.

“They took on many different occupations just to work their way into society, from being a construction worker to working at a laundromat to owning their own restaurant together to starting their own business in plastic manufacturing,” he said. “When they were getting settled, they brought in more family members, and then I was born 10 years later into a life that was different from their experience when they first came here.”

The designs from this collection, which Wang describes as “immigrant Americana,” combined his parents’ experience with Wang’s upbringing in the U.S., including references to Harley-Davidson motorcycles, rock ‘n’ roll, and football mixed with frog closures, Mandarin collars, and decorated surgical masks. The concept came from wanting to highlight his parents’ journey fused with his love for Americana music, which Wang said he listened to growing up.

As part of his research, Wang took a road trip to Santa Barbara from Los Angeles with his parents — who are divorced — and siblings last year.

It was the first time that he heard the story about his parents’ immigration.

“We hadn’t taken a trip with just immediate family in over 20 years, and it was the perfect opportunity and setting for me to really interview my parents on their story about how they first arrived,” Wang said. “It was so inspiring, but also new to me because, surprisingly, I had never asked them about it before.”

The June event was also the first time his father attended one of his fashion shows and the first time his family was all together for a collection showing, which Wang said made it even more symbolic.

He added that he feels blessed to have a platform where he’s able to share his story as an American with immigrant roots as well as show his collection during a time when he feels change is important.

“I wanted to take the idea of my roots and put it into all these things — a singular narrative that felt very much true to who I am today,” Wang said.

“Hopefully this will be a move toward something that will help the industry think about how we approach seasons, collections and shipping things because it does need some revamping,"" he added. ""And it’s exciting to be a part of a time where we can do something different.”

SEOUL, South Korea — Two hundred family members separated by the decades-long Korean War will take part in emotional reunions next month, South Korea said Friday — the latest breakthrough in North Korea’s diplomatic thaw.

The families will be briefly reunited August 20-26 at a resort in Mount Kumgang, or ""Diamond Mountain,"" in North Korea, the South’s Unification Ministry announced after talks.

The temporary reunions, which would be the first in three years, are among steps promised by Kim Jong Un following historic meetings with President Donald Trump earlier this month and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in May.

South Korean Red Cross President Park Kyung-seo, right, agreed the reunions after talks with North Korean counterpart Pak Yong Il. South Korea Unification Ministry / AP

Each country will send 100 participants, the ministry said, to be chosen from what is normally a huge number of applications.

More than 66,000 South Korean family members have been separated by the Korean War of 1950-53, which is still in a truce because no peace treaty was ever signed.

Recent improved relations come after serious deterioration during 2016 and 2017 over the North's nuclear and missile programs.

Although the Korean reunions are agreed to by government officials, the family arrangements are organized by the Red Cross.

The events are often emotional — as most of those wishing to take part are elderly people eager to see their loved ones before they die.

Sara Netanyahu, wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was charged with fraud on Thursday for allegedly misusing over $100,000 in public funds to order lavish meals from some of the country's most famous chefs, a court spokesperson said.

The indictment charged that Netanyahu, along with a government employee, fraudulently obtained more than $100,000 for hundreds of meals supplied by restaurants, bypassing regulations prohibiting the practice if a cook is employed at the home.

She was charged with aggravated fraud and breach of trust, according to the indictment released by the Justice Ministry.

If convicted, she could face a maximum sentence of five years in prison, though that seemed unlikely. It was unclear when her trial would begin.

A former deputy director of the prime minister's residence is also charged in the case.

452,452,,nbcnews.com,"It was a long journey to get the right evaluations and diagnoses, and her son is finally making progress, Marlene said. But she braces for a day when he might have to do without this therapy and others that are paid for through Medicaid. Because she’s undocumented, she’s extremely nervous about filling out applications for government programs like this.

Already, she has decided to stop receiving food stamps, now known as SNAP, which her children, as citizens, are entitled to based on the family’s income.

She dropped it because the application to receive those benefits changed, she said.

“They are asking a lot of questions,” she said. “They are investigating one’s life from head to toe.”

Marlene said she was nervous, in particular, about being asked to provide years of pay stubs and other eligibility requirements she had not experienced before. Marlene said the application alone made her “sick from stress.”

Repeated calls and emails to Texas health officials to ask about the changes in the benefits application process went unanswered.

Marlene’s son has Medicaid for the next several months. But she is worried how that application will change, too, next time she has to apply.

Health care groups say they’ve observed other immigrant families making similar choices, and they think it will accelerate if a proposed change to green card eligibility becomes law. Under the proposed change, if family members receive government services — even if those family members are citizens — it would ding the applicants’ chances of approval for permanent residency.

“We are seeing families having to make this impossible choice,” said Maria Hernandez, the founder of Vela, a nonprofit in Austin that helps parents who have children with disabilities.

Hernandez instructs parents how to advocate for their children and how to find the appropriate health care and therapies for their kids, and helps them find community support, among other things.

She conducts many of these classes in what used to be an elementary school on the east side of Austin, known as one of the most diverse areas of the city. She said about seven in 10 of the families she works with are immigrants — mostly from Mexico.

“We are working with families who the parents are immigrants but the children are born here,” Hernandez said.

Parents tell Hernandez they feel like they can’t risk any attention from the government, even if that means losing badly needed benefits for their kids.

In the first year of the Trump administration, Central Texas experienced an uptick in immigration raids and deportations. Since then, Hernandez said, a lot of people in the immigrant community have been making critical choices out of fear.

“It’s out of fear of deportation,” she said. “It’s out of fear of having their children being penalized in some way and potentially losing a parent that until this point has been their fierce advocate.”

In Texas, this is a decision that is bound to affect a significant number of children, said Anne Dunkelberg with the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin. Dunkelberg has been closely watching various immigration proposals and their effect on access to government services.

“A quarter of Texas children have at least one parent who is not a U.S. citizen,” she said. “Now, I am sure that not a hundred percent of those kids — and it’s about 1.8 million kids — not a hundred percent of them are using a public benefit, but a very high percentage will be.”

Dunkelberg said families opting out of Medicaid could further raise the number of uninsured in Texas, which is already the highest in the nation.

Hernandez said parents who have children with disabilities have told her that without Medicaid they’ll rely on emergency rooms “as needed.”

“We know that that is not a good plan for kids that for forever have been followed by a neurologist because they have seizures or have been going to occupational therapy for years and are finally making progress,” she said.

Approximately 10 million citizen children in the U.S. have at least one non-citizen parent.

But an experimental new approach that combines new immunotherapy drugs with a tailor-made therapy to boost her own immune system pulled Perkins back from the brink of death. She’s just completed a 1,200-mile kayaking trip around the state of Florida and is looking forward to decades more of life.

“I hit the jackpot,” said Perkins, who is now 52 and cancer-free more than two years later.

Perkins really is lucky. The intensive, tailored approach only helps 15 percent of the patients who tried it, said Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, who led the team that treated Perkins.

But Rosenberg, who has dedicated his career to finding a way to harness the body’s immune system to fight cancer, think her case has taken his quest a big step forward.

“We are getting better all the time,” said Rosenberg, whose findings are published in the journal Nature Medicine.

What his findings mean, he says, is that oncologists have to recognize that cancer is unique to every patient, and that treatments must reflect that.

“We have to develop a new drug for every patient,” Rosenberg said.

Perkins’ immune system was already trying to fight off the tumors that had spread across her torso. What Rosenberg aims to do is find and amplify the immune system cells that are doing the best job of it, even as they are overwhelmed by the cancer’s spread.

The team took samples of her tumors and sequenced their DNA. They also sampled tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, the immune system cells that were stuck to the outside of the tumors. After finding the genetic mutations that allowed the tumor cells to take over their victim’s body, Rosenberg’s team chose the immune cells that were latching onto those particular mutations most effectively.

“It’s a whole different way of thinking about cancer treatment.""

Those cells they grew outside Perkin’s body and then re-infused back into her system. They also dosed her with the immune-boosting drug interleukin 2, as well as with Keytruda, one of the newer immunotherapies that have been shown to have remarkable effects in certain cancers.

And she went through one last round of chemo to give the new lymphocytes room to take over.

It worked.

“The patient had these large, almost tennis-ball-sized lesions, one growing almost through her chest wall,” Rosenberg told NBC News.

“She had tumors throughout her belly and lymph nodes, and everything disappeared when we targeted four of the mutations that her tumors were expressing,"" he added.

""She probably would have had two to three months to live had we not treated her.”

Perkins could feel one big tumor in her chest and she knew when the treatment started working. “That tumor I could palpate with my fingers and it started to get softer and shrink,” she said.

Targeted cancer drugs are formulated to match specific mutations seen in specific cancers. But Rosenberg said he has found that tumors in one patient have mutations that are different from those seen in other patients.

And while the new immunotherapy drugs help the body's immune system recognize tumors, they only work in a small percentage of patients.

Rosenberg's team often takes on last-ditch cases — people with months to live, whose cancer has come back again and again despite multiple treatments. He’s treated patients with liver cancer, bile duct cancer, melanoma and other cancers.

Only a few of them live, but those cases are spectacular.

Perkins knew this when she signed up for the trial.

“They told me they had treated 12 patients and were following up on one,” she said. “That means 11 died. I’m an engineer. I can do math. I know 11 out of 12 isn’t great odds.”

Perkins, who lives in Port Lucie, Florida, sent two friends with breast cancer to Rosenberg’s lab and both of them died despite the treatment — one of them with severe side-effects from the treatment itself, she said.

Rosenberg is quick to say the approach is not ready for commercial use, but he notes that CAR-T, a similarly personalized cancer treatment that works in blood cancers, that has been commercialized by companies including Kite Pharmaceuticals and Gilead Sciences.

CAR-T only works in blood cancers, Rosenberg said. A different tactic is needed for solid tumors, such as breast cancer. And even though it is very expensive and very complicated, CAR-T can be successful, he noted. “It’s a whole different way of thinking about cancer treatment,” he said.

“If you can develop treatments that can cure patients, people will want them.”

Cancer specialists not involved in the experiment called it a major advance. Dr. Laszlo Radvanyi of the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research in Toronto described it as “an unprecedented response in such advanced breast cancer”.

“We are now at the cusp of a major revolution,” Radvanyi wrote in a commentary.

“This particular technique is highly specialized and complex, meaning that it will not be suitable for many people, but it is exciting because it shows how the immune cells already inside cancers may be switched on and made to work better,” said Dr. Peter Johnson of Southampton General Hospital in Britain.

As for Perkins, she says she is no longer a “professional cancer patient”. “I got back to doing what I like to do,” she told NBC News.

The cancer forced her to drop plans to start nursing school after ending a career as an engineer. She had also started a “bucket list” of adventures and will continue ticking off experiences.

“We went rafting down the Grand Canyon,” said Perkins, who has two sons and two stepsons with her husband.

She just completed the Florida kayak trip and looks forward to more. “It’s 1,200 miles of pure suffering,” she said. “I loved every minute of it.”",Experimental immune treatment saves dying breast cancer patient,http://nbcnews.com/health/health-news/highly-personalized-treatment-saves-breast-cancer-patient-n879841

At least five people have died soon after being fitted with balloons designed to help them lose weight, the Food and Drug Administration said Thursday.

The FDA says it doesn’t know if the devices or the surgery to implant them is to blame but issued an alert to doctors to closely monitor patients who get them.

“All five reports indicate that patient deaths occurred within a month or less of balloon placement,” the FDA said in a statement.

“In three reports, death occurred as soon as one to three days after balloon placement. At this time, we do not know the root cause or incidence rate of patient death, nor have we been able to definitively attribute the deaths to the devices or the insertion procedures for these devices.”

One of the devices is a balloon that can be placed in the stomach and filled with saline water, the Orbera balloon made by Apollo Endo-Surgery. The other is a dual balloon system made by ReShape. Apollo, which says it has sold 277,000 of the devices globally, said it was preparing a statement.

Apollo said it reported the deaths to the FDA. ""There have been five reported deaths of patients who had received the Orbera intragastric balloon in four different countries since Orbera's FDA approval in August of 2015,"" the company said in a statement.

""Apollo self-reported all five cases to the FDA as part of its Global Product Surveillance program.""

The FDA says it's looking into two other deaths.

“The Agency has also received two additional reports of deaths in the same time period related to potential complications associated with balloon treatment (one gastric perforation with the Orbera Intragastric Balloon System and one esophageal perforation with the ReShape Integrated Dual Balloon System),” the FDA added.

The FDA’s adverse report system is very broad and is not designed to immediately prove a device or drug caused a complication. It is meant to gather information about anything that happens while someone is using a device or drug, or soon after, so that investigators can determine cause and effect.

""For the first patient in Brazil, the cause of death was reported to be a heart attack. An autopsy was performed but the final report was not provided to us. There was no evidence provided of a device‐related malfunction or causation in this case,"" Apollo said in its statement.

""For the second patient in Brazil, the hospital reported that a non‐device related gastric perforation occurred, causing complication and eventual death.""

Causes of death for a patient in Britain and one in the U.S. were not known, the company said. A patient who died in Mexico had a heart abnormality but it's not clear what caused the death.

Gastric balloons are among many different devices on the market to treat severe obesity. They aim to reduce how much a person can eat by filling the stomach, closing off part of the stomach or even surgically reducing stomach volume.

The need is great for different ways to treat obesity.

Obesity drugs have not been big commercial successes although several are now on the market. Several drugs were removed from the shelves years ago after they were found to cause problems such as stroke.

Diets are equally bad at helping people keep off the pounds for long periods of time. But surgical procedures to shrink the stomach have been very successful. One study showed the surgery helped people to lose enough weight to reverse their type-2 diabetes.

The American Diabetes Association and other groups have endorsed bariatric surgery as a way to treat type-2 diabetes.","Five Die While Using Obesity Devices, FDA Says",http://nbcnews.com/health/health-news/five-die-while-using-obesity-devices-fda-says-n791646

Allegations of sexual abuse carried out over decades by team physicians at Michigan State and Ohio State are sending ripples through university athletics departments, with some schools exploring whether more oversight is needed for figures in such powerful positions.

The scandals involving former Michigan State team doctor Larry Nassar, who was also a physician for USA Gymnastics, and Richard Strauss, a former Ohio State doctor, reveal how the trust and intimacy granted to team physicians can also provide cover for sexual predators.

“It’s almost this god figure that people don’t want to question,” said Dani Moffit, who leads a master’s program in athletic training at Idaho State University and researches sexual harassment in college sports. “They are thought to be these people who are not going to make mistakes.”

Exam chaperones

Groups that represent team doctors say it’s hardly the only profession shaken by sex scandals, and they largely blame the recent cases on a couple bad seeds. Still, the fallout has left some doctors and colleges scrutinizing their practices.

Some are ramping up the use of exam chaperones — medical staff who are brought into the room to monitor the doctor’s work. Purdue University says it’s crafting a new policy requiring chaperones for team doctors, even if students don’t request one. Michigan State updated a similar policy last year.

Physicians, too, are increasingly bringing in chaperones for their own protection, said Dr. Chad Asplund, president of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine. In his work at Georgia Southern University, Asplund said, he has become more diligent about calling for a chaperone any time he examines a female athlete or asks a patient to remove clothing.

“It’s safety for the patient and safety for me,” Asplund said. “I think people are becoming a lot more protected and a lot more cautious about doing the right thing.”

News of the Nassar case prompted leaders at the University of Wisconsin to launch a wide review of their own practices, including safety measures guiding team doctors. Officials declined to share details, saying the study has yet to wrap up.

Athletic trainers, who work alongside team doctors and treat minor injuries, have also been alarmed by the allegations. In the Nassar case, two trainers were reportedly told of Nassar’s abuse but failed to stop it.

Moffit, at Idaho State, said she’s adding lectures on sexual abuse and is helping other colleges develop their own training, which she says has long been overlooked in a male-dominated field.

“It’s something that is going to be talked about a lot more. There’s just so much education that has to be done,” she said.

The National Athletic Trainers’ Association responded by issuing new guidance to members, telling them how to identify abuse. Trainers are also being told to report misconduct to legal authorities first rather than university officials, who in some cases have been accused of keeping accusations quiet.

Some colleges, though, say it’s too soon to make changes. At the University of Iowa, athletics officials said they’re “following the national conversation” to see if updates are needed. Others declined to comment, including the universities of Michigan and Illinois.

A 'vulnerable' age

Both recent cases have cast light on a role that typically operates behind the scenes but can still carry great power. Decisions made by team doctors can shape an athlete’s career, determining how long they’ll be out with an injury or whether they’re even fit enough to make a team.

That power, coupled with the familiarity they often develop with younger athletes, creates a dynamic that is ripe for abuse, said Dr. Saul Marks, a sports psychiatrist at the University of Toronto.

“Athletes are especially vulnerable at this age. They’re looking for guidance and growth, and so the intensity in the relationships can be stronger,” said Marks, who has also served as a doctor for Canada’s national diving team. “As people become closer, boundary crossings can become easier to slide into without realizing what’s happening.”

When abuse does occur, the risk tied to reporting it is often enough to silence victims whose athletic careers hang in the balance, said Sue Ann Van Dermyden, the head of a California law firm that helps colleges investigate sexual misconduct.

“They recognize by bringing it forward, their dreams could be shattered,” she said.

In April, a state investigation in Michigan found that Nassar twisted the power and privacy of his job for abuse. Over time, he convinced gymnasts that his vaginal “treatments” had a medical purpose. And with no chaperone policy, there was often no one there to question it.

Details at Ohio State are still emerging. An outside firm has been hired to investigate complaints against Strauss, who was a team doctor in the 1980s and ’90s and died in 2005. The school says men from 14 varsity sports have brought allegations of sexual misconduct, but officials have declined to elaborate.

An Associated Press review of Ohio State employment records also revealed that Strauss worked at five other universities, including Harvard and Rutgers universities. Most of them would not say if they are reviewing his time there or whether any concerns were raised about him.

Asplund, at Georgia Southern, said both cases appear to stem from physicians who became too powerful within their institutions, but he doesn’t see it as a sign of deeper problems in the industry.

“The Nassar case and the Strauss case were unfortunate, but they were outliers,” he said. “I hope we don’t hear about anything more.”",College abuse scandals put sports doctors under new scrutiny,http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/college-abuse-scandals-put-sports-doctors-under-new-scrutiny-n886336

The Trump administration has detained 2,322 children 12 years old or younger amid its border crackdown, a Department of Health and Human Services official told Kaiser Health News on Wednesday. They represent almost 20 percent of the immigrant children currently held by the U.S. government in the wake of its latest immigrant prosecution policy.

Their welfare is being overseen by a small division of the Department of Health and Human Services — the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) — which has little experience or expertise in handling very young children.

The number of children has exploded in the past six weeks since the Trump administration moved to stop parents and their children at the U.S. border and separate and detain them in different facilities. A total of 11,786 children under age 18 are currently detained, the official said.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that seeks to detain parents and children together. The order also changes oversight of detention from HHS to the Department of Homeland Security. But it’s unclear whether the children currently detained by HHS will be transferred and whether the order will comply with a court standard for the treatment of children in custody, known as the Flores agreement.

Since 2003, ORR has been charged with sheltering and finding suitable homes for “unaccompanied alien children” — generally teenaged immigrants who reach the United States without a parent or guardian.

But its responsibilities have morphed and multiplied since April because the immigration crackdown means that the ORR is now responsible for detaining not only more children, but minors who are far younger than those who had arrived in the past, experts said.

Beyond specialized medical care, younger children have different food and housing needs, and require more personal attention.

“The children are younger and will be there for a longer time and are deeply traumatized by being forcibly separated from their parents,” said Mark Greenberg, a former administration official at HHS’ Administration for Children and Families, which oversees the ORR. “All of that makes it much more difficult to operate the program.”

The complex crisis is magnified by the inexperience of some of the political appointees leading the response, said critics who include former officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations of the past decade.

ORR Director Scott Lloyd is a lawyer whose career has been focused on anti-abortion efforts. He led the Trump administration’s legal efforts to prevent abortions for detained teen immigrants. Lloyd’s main immigration experience before leading ORR was research for a report on refugees for the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic service organization with an anti-abortion stance, according to a deposition he gave in lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union.

Kenneth Wolfe, the HHS spokesman who provided the figures, declined to address how many people are currently working at ORR or whether ORR had secured additional staff or expertise to cope with the influx of young children. He also would not say how many of the 2,322 children 12 and younger have been separated from their families.

The administration had previously refused to provide the ages of the children separated from their families — saying only that about 2,300 children have been separated and detained since the policy took effect.

The detention conditions, which include children being held in chain-link holding pens and “tent cities,” have ignited a political firestorm over possible abuse in the treatment of children as young as 4. Some of these younger children — including toddlers — are being sent to “tender age” shelters, according to media reports. The care is also costly: Tents alone cost HHS $775 per person per day, according to media reports.

“The children are younger and will be there for a longer time and are deeply traumatized by being forcibly separated from their parents.”

Republicans, including former first lady Laura Bush, have called on the administration to stop the policy. Trump has blamed Congress for the detentions, but top White House advisers were actively promoting family separations as a policy shift.

News reports have described children as young as five being scolded for playing, one teenager teaching others how to change a small child’s diaper, and caretakers not being permitted to touch children. ProPublica reported that more than 100 children detained are younger than four.

ORR, experts add, is already at a disadvantage.

“It’s significantly challenging to create that capacity, and quite expensive,” noted Robert Carey, a former ORR director from the Obama administration. “All the aspects of care are dramatically different based on age. … You need people who are trained in early childhood development or care.”

That’s a heavy lift for an office that, experts stress, was never built to serve as a long-term housing system.

It’s not clear, Carey and others said, that the administration has had sufficient time or support to adapt.

Many ORR employees, Carey added, are career staffers with deep knowledge about immigration and child welfare, with whom he frequently worked while in office.

“The kids are going into the custody of ORR without adequate resources,” said Shadi Houshyar, who directs early childhood and child welfare initiatives at Families USA, an advocacy group. “It’s definitely going to result in some potentially damaging decisions being made. The capacity, training and fundamental orientation — while understanding the needs of children — is not the orientation that ORR has.”

While ORR has a history of placing teenagers who arrive on their own with relatives of families in the U.S., that challenge is heightened by the policy of separating children, who are young and may understand little of the experience or be able to identify relatives who could take them in.

Making matters more complicated, when families are separated, parents and children are tracked by different federal agencies — the parents by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the children by ORR. Children are also tracked and treated the same as minors who arrived on their own. Together, that makes reunification more difficult. And that’s a problem experts worry will persist, even if family separations cease.

“It does not look like they’ve figured out this process,” said a former HHS official, who requested anonymity because she could face professional ramifications for speaking publicly. As a result, she added, “the time the child stays in ORR could be significantly longer” — which in turn adds to trauma and causes other long-term problems.

People all over could be breathing in the lingering particles from years-old smoke breaks, researchers reported Wednesday.

They found evidence that lingering smoke particles — called thirdhand smoke — can be picked up and spread all around buildings by forced air HVAC systems.

That could mean that people need to be aware not only of secondhand smoke from cigarettes and other tobacco products, but might need to worry about people taking smoke breaks outside, or even the residue from years ago.

“For people who do not smoke and avoid areas where smoking occurs, this is an additional involuntary exposure route for environmental tobacco smoke species,” Peter DeCarlo and colleagues at Drexel University in Philadelphia wrote.

Secondhand tobacco smoke has killed at least 2.5 million non-smokers since 1964, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates. CDC estimates that secondhand smoke causes 7,300 lung cancer deaths a year and 34,000 heart disease deaths.

The effects of thirdhand tobacco smoke are less well-studied, although several groups have warned about potential dangers.

“Over the last decade the concept of thirdhand smoke has emerged as a distinct entity that poses health risks because hazardous compounds in thirdhand smoke include many that are toxic or cancer-causing agents,” the California Consortium for Thirdhand Smoke says on its website.

Any kind of smoke can stick to surfaces and linger deep in fabrics. And the many chemicals in tobacco smoke can react with other chemicals to form new compounds.

“Of special concern relative to thirdhand smoke is that nicotine and other post-combustion tobacco constituents can interact with other environmental chemicals to form new toxicants and carcinogens,” Thomas Northrup of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and colleagues wrote in the journal Public Health Reports.

The Food and Drug Administration warns about thirdhand smoke.

“Like children, dogs and cats spend a lot of time on or near the floor, where tobacco smoke residue concentrates in house dust, carpets and rugs. Then, it gets on their fur,” FDA veterinarian Carmela Stamper said in astatement.

“Dogs, cats and children not only breathe these harmful substances in, but pets can also ingest them by licking their owner’s hair, skin, and clothes.”

DeCarlo’s team ran a test in a single classroom that had been a non-smoking room for years. To their surprise, they found many components of tobacco smoke in the air.

In fact, 29 percent of the particles in the air appeared to have been affected by tobacco smoke residue.

They’re not sure how those particles got there.

“However, the classroom where measurements were performed is 20 meters (yards) down the hall from an outdoor balcony where illicit smoking activity occurs,” they wrote.

Or particles could have been picked up and spread by the building’s HVAC system.

They ran a controlled experiment and found cigarette smoke stuck well to the sides of a Pyrex glass container, and then got picked up again when air was passed through.

Forced air might do that in a building. “HVAC systems recirculate and disperse air throughout the multiple rooms of the zone served by the system, meaning that what happens in one room affects all the other rooms in the zone,” they wrote.

“For this reason, a room located near a smoking area with smoke penetration or a room occupied by a smoker can effectively expose the other occupants served by the same HVAC system to thirdhand smoke, even if they do not share space directly.”",HVAC systems spread thirdhand smoke,http://nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hvac-systems-spread-thirdhand-smoke-n872851

FluMist, the only needle-free flu vaccine on the market, won a lukewarm recommendation from federal vaccine advisers Wednesday.

The nasal spray vaccine has been off the U.S. market for two years because it barely worked against one common strain of flu in kids. The company that makes it, MedImmune, says it has reformulated the vaccine and thinks it will work better next year.

“This is not an easy decision,” said Dr. Nancy Bennett, chair of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), whose decision guide which vaccines are available on the U.S. market.

ACIP voted 12-2 to add FluMist back to the mix of flu vaccines that doctors and clinics can use.

The vaccine experts on the committee weakened their usual recommendation to make it clear they were not ready to strongly endorse FluMist. They changed the wording to say it's up to doctors to choose.

There are several different formulations of influenza vaccine. FluMist is known as live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV. Injected vaccines use either inactivated virus — they’re called IIV for short — or genetically engineered (recombinant) virus, known as RIV for short.

“For the 2018-19 season, immunization providers may choose to administer any licensed, age appropriate, influenza vaccine (including LAIV, IIV and RIV). LAIV4 is an option for influenza vaccination for persons for whom it is otherwise appropriate,” the new recommendation reads.

This wording puts FluMist on the “recommended” list, which means insurance companies have to pay for its use, without being a strong endorsement. FluMist never lost its approval from the Food and Drug Administration, but vaccine providers usually don't even make a product available unless it has an ACIP endorsement.

ACIP members voted against recommending injected vaccines over FluMist.

There is real worry among flu experts that the poor effectiveness of flu vaccines, especially this past season, may make Americans less willing to get it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone over the age of 6 months get a flu vaccine every year, but fewer than half of all Americans do.

“There is potential for harm if the new formulation of (FluMist) is recommended and used and is not effective,” the CDC’s Dr. Lisa Grohskopf, who is not a member of ACIP and who led a team reviewing FluMist’s past effectiveness, told the committee.

Two panel members said they were worried about hurting children and further undermining the public’s perception of the safety of flu vaccines if FluMist comes back on the market and does not work well.

“I have real mixed emotions about this because I think we want to protect as many people as we can, particularly, as a pediatrician, for children,” said Dr. Henry Bernstein, a professor of pediatrics at Cohen Children’s Medical Center in New York.

But others said they were equally worried that kids are not being vaccinated against flu because the needle-free option is not available, and they noted that FluMist is clearly better than not getting vaccinated at all. It works well against H3N2 flu virus, which has been the dominant virus making people sick during the current severe flu season.

“It’s better than nothing,” said Dr. Grace Lee, a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of medicine.

(ACIP) declined to recommend FluMist in 2016 and again for this season, citing studies that showed it only reduced the risk of getting influenza by 3 percent over the past three flu seasons. It’s been off the U.S. market since then, although it is still used in other countries, including Canada and the European Union.

Grohskopf said a thorough CDC review confirmed FluMist did not work well against H1N1 in recent years, although it was effective against the other flu strains.

AstraZeneca, which makes FluMist at its MedImmune subsidiary outside Washington, D.C., said it reformulated the H1N1 component of the vaccine and presented evidence that it now works better.

But Grohskopf pointed out that no one can know that until there’s a flu season in which H1N1 is the dominant strain. This past year, H3N2 has dominated. The CDC says influenza has killed 84 kids so far this year and says H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B strains have all killed children.

“None of us knows what is going to happen,” she said.

All flu vaccines are a cocktail, made using three or four strains of the most common circulating flu viruses. They must be reformulated every year for the upcoming influenza season.

FluMist is a little different from other vaccines because not only is it spritzed up the nose, but it uses “live” flu virus. For that reason, some kids, such as those with asthma, usually cannot be administered FluMist, anyway.

Many older adults should avoid taking vitamin D and calcium supplements to prevent falls and fractures, and focus instead on exercises to improve balance and coordination, U.S. doctors recommend.

The conclusion issued Tuesday by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on fall and fracture prevention comes amid growing debate in the medical community over the role of vitamin D, which may help some people at lower doses but is linked to an increased risk of fractures, falls, kidney stones and certain cancers at higher doses.

“Vitamin D should not be taken to prevent falls in older adults, and lower doses of vitamin D and calcium do not prevent fractures in postmenopausal women,” said Task Force vice chair Dr. Alex Krist, of Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.

“If healthy people are taking vitamin D solely for these reasons, they should probably stop,” Krist said by email. “We know that there are more effective interventions for people concerned about falls, like exercise.”

Vitamin D helps the body use calcium to support bone health. The recommended daily intake of vitamin D for most adults is 600 international units, or 800 IU after age 70.

Some people take vitamin D because it isn’t in many foods, though it can be found in beef liver, canned salmon or sardines, cheese and egg yolks as well as fortified milk and orange juice. Most milk sold in the U.S., for example, contains 100 IU of vitamin D per cup.

Getting vitamin D and calcium from foods has been linked to a reduced risk of decreased bone density, known as osteoporosis, that can contribute to falls and fractures among older adults.

But there isn’t yet enough evidence to determine the benefits and harms of taking vitamin D or calcium supplements to prevent fractures in men or women who haven’t gone through menopause, the Task Force concludes.

After menopause, when decreased supplies of the hormone estrogen may increase the risk of osteoporosis, the Task Force recommends against lower doses of vitamin D and calcium to prevent fractures. There isn’t enough evidence yet to determine the advantages or harms of high doses for postmenopausal women.

Exercise, however, can reduce the risk of falls and also lower the likelihood of falls causing serious injuries, said Dr. Janelle Guirguis-Blake, author of an evidence review published in JAMA and a researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle.","Older adults may not need vitamin D to prevent falls, fractures",http://nbcnews.com/health/health-news/older-adults-may-not-need-vitamin-d-prevent-falls-fractures-n866861

Taxes on junk food, sodas, tobacco and other unhealthy products help cut both disease and the cost to society and are well worth the effort, experts argued on Wednesday.

A global analysis of such “sin” taxes show they discourage people from smoking and from eating and drinking unhealthy foods, and raise money to help fight and treat the diseases they cause.

And, contrary to popular belief, these taxes do not disproportionately hurt the poor, the experts found.

“Taxes are an underused instrument for the prevention of premature death and disease because they can discourage consumption of products like tobacco, alcohol, and sugary beverages that contribute to cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes, mental health problems, and injuries,” wrote Larry Summers, a former treasury secretary and an emeritus professor at Harvard University.

“Tobacco and alcohol taxes consistently raise prices, reduce consumption, and save lives, while generating additional revenues to support public services,” Summers added in a commentary on the study, published in the Lancet Medical Journal.

Several U.S. cities have tried to tax or otherwise limit sodas and other sugary drinks. The American Beverage Association has succeeded in taking Philadelphia’s tax to the Pennsylvania state supreme court. San Francisco, Oakland, and Boulder, Colorado as well as other cities have small, one to two-cent per ounce taxes.

Studies show the taxes work to reduce consumption. Tobacco taxes are less controversial than taxes on foods and drink, but sugary drinks and junk food have been shown to cause cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and other so-called non-communicable diseases, which are also the biggest killers globally.

An argument against the taxes is that they hit poorer people harder, but Louis Niessen of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and colleagues reviewed dozens of studies and found the argument does not hold up.

“The poor, with already shorter life expectancies and bearing the brunt of undernutrition, malnutrition, childhood diseases, major infections, and pregnancy-related conditions, are the most likely to be affected by non-communicable diseases,” Niessen said in a statement.

“Compared with richer households, people with lower incomes get sick more often and die earlier from consuming tobacco, alcohol, and non-essential energy dense foods,” Summers added.

And, the researchers said the evidence shows that richer people spend more on alcohol, soft drinks and snacks than do the poor.

“In addition to another important treatment option for Lennox-Gastaut patients, this first-ever approval of a drug specifically for Dravet patients will provide a significant and needed improvement in the therapeutic approach to caring for people with this condition.”

The approval only covers use of the liquid drug for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. FDA advisers recommended the approval in April.

It is not a go-ahead for other marijuana-based products, Gottlieb stressed.

“This is an important medical advance,” he said. “But it’s also important to note that this is not an approval of marijuana or all of its components. This is the approval of one specific CBD medication for a specific use.”

It’s very different from using pure cannabis in any form.

“This is a purified form of CBD. It’s being delivered to patients in a reliable dosage form and through a reproducible route of delivery to ensure that patients derive the anticipated benefits,” Gottlieb said.

Many companies sell cannabis-based treatments, touting them as cancer cures, pain relievers and anxiety medicines. The FDA has been warning the public against falling for these unproven claims.

“The promotion and use of these unapproved products may keep some patients from accessing appropriate, recognized therapies to treat serious and even fatal diseases,” Gottlieb said.

He said the FDA would review legitimate applications for approval but said the agency needed solid scientific studies that demonstrate whether a product actually works and is safe.

“Such a process ensures that any new therapies from marijuana and its constituents are safe, effective and manufactured to a high and consistent quality and most importantly, that these products have been proven safe and effective for patients,” Gottlieb added.

The drug has been shown to reduce seizures and return a few children to near-normal function.

Dravet syndrome is a rare genetic condition that usually shows up in infants, starting with fever-related seizures and progressing to other, more severe seizure types.

“Children with Dravet syndrome typically experience poor development of language and motor skills, hyperactivity and difficulty relating to others,” the FDA said.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome also causes seizures, usually starting in children aged 3 to 5. “Almost all children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome develop learning problems and intellectual disability,” the FDA said.

“Many also have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting and crawling. Most people with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome require help with usual activities of daily living.”

Medical marijuana is legal in 29 states, Guam and Puerto Rico. Studies have shown that it can have some benefits in reducing anxiety, counteracting some types of nausea, and that it may relieve some symptoms of glaucoma and multiple sclerosis.

The FDA has approved several marijuana-based products, including the synthetic formulation Marinol, prescribed to treat severe appetite loss and nausea in conditions such as AIDS. But marijuana products in general are subject to Schedule I restrictions by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) because of the potential for abuse.

462,462,,nbcnews.com,"Every year, flu kills between 12,000 and 56,000 people, the CDC says. This year is shaping up to be on the high end of that range. It's killed 84 children so far this season, CDC said Friday. Most were not vaccinated.

That’s why teams of scientists are working on what’s called a universal flu vaccine. The hope is to develop a formulation that will recognize something a little deeper than just the “face” of the flu virus — something that doesn’t change from one virus to another, and that doesn’t mutate over time.

That could lead to a flu vaccine that people would just have to get once or twice over a lifetime — one that would protect against new mutant strains of virus as well as the “drifted” strains that pop up during the flu season.

A universal vaccine would also use better technology than the current most common technology, which relies on a very old-fashioned and error-prone process starting with chicken eggs.

This process itself can cause the virus to mutate, recent research shows. It also takes months and can break down at any of the many steps.

It’s virtually useless for fighting new pandemic strains of virus that could sweep the world in weeks or months.

Related: Flu Shot Fail: Why Vaccines Don't Always Work

“If you really want to take influenza vaccinology to where it belongs, hopefully, we should never have to grow a virus,” says Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).

Some vaccines do skip this process and are made using bits of genetic material from flu virus and grown in either dog kidney cells or in caterpillar cells. They’re a little quicker to make and some tests indicate they may protect better than standard flu vaccines, but they are still based on the constantly changing “faces” of flu viruses, and thus have to be updated annually.

Viruses are small and simple. Influenza A has just 11 proteins, and just a few of them are accessible on the surface of the virus, where the immune system can “see” them.

Influenza can change the appearance of these surface proteins easily and quickly. So a better vaccine will have to go deeper, and help the body’s immune system recognize a less easily disguised part of the virus.

“There’s a lot of talented people working on this issue,” said Robert Johnson, director of the Influenza and Emerging Infectious Diseases Division of the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (BARDA). BARDA, part of the Health and Human Services Department, oversees and pays for research into new technologies such as advanced flu vaccines.

Peter Palese, a microbiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, has a team working on a vaccine that goes after one unchanging target.

One of influenza’s most prominent surface protein is hemagglutinin — the “H” in a flu virus’s name. It’s a mushroom-shaped structure and while the “cap” of the flu mushroom is both easily seen and also changeable, the stem is less visible and also mutates less.

Palese’s lab is focusing on ways to stimulate the immune system to recognize the stem or stalk of the hemagglutinin protein -- the equivalent of tweaking facial recognition technology so look for the overall shape of someone's face, or the distance between the eyes.

At the NIAID, Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger and colleagues worked up a vaccine cocktail that uses four different types of hemagglutinin from avian flu viruses. Why bird flu?

“The ultimate sources of pandemic flu strains are birds,” Taubenberger said. From H5N1 to H7N9, the viruses that threaten to cause havoc are bird flu viruses. The H1N1 virus that caused the 1918 pandemic originated in birds.

Taubenberger was originally trying to make a vaccine that could be stockpiled for quick use in case a pandemic does start. But it turns out that using avian flu viruses as the basis for new vaccines also stimulates what’s called a broad response.

Animals vaccinated with the cocktail were protected against strains of flu virus that were not included in the cocktail.

That’s sounding close to a universal flu vaccine.

How does it happen? Avian viruses don’t have the same cloaking technology that human flu virus strains employ, Taubenberger said. As flu viruses evolve and replicate inside their human hosts, they display sugars to hide their “faces” in a process called glycosylation.

“Avian viruses don’t have those,” Taubenberger said. Plus, his team’s vaccine generates antibodies against the hemagglutinin stalk. At least, it does so in mice and in ferrets, the animals that get flu in the way most similar to humans.

Taubenberger’s discovery made headlines in 2015 but he came up against a wall that demonstrates why vaccines take so long to develop. He was making the vaccine using virus-like particles or VLPs. “They are empty, non-infectious viruses,” he said. They’re like the shell of the flu virus, without the inner workings.

The vaccine stimulated 100 percent flu immunity in mice. “But it turns out to be complicated and expensive to make,” Taubenberger said. “We are worried that it might be a little bit expensive.”

Pricey vaccines don’t sell, and they don’t attract the drug companies that would be making and selling them.

So his team worked up a cheaper approach, by simply chemically damaging flu viruses so they aren’t infectious but still look like flu viruses to the immune system, and making the cocktail from those. “It’s looking good in mice and ferrets,” he said.

“The only way to really evaluate this is going to be in humans,” he added. He’s planning that study now.

Will this vaccine be a truly universal flu vaccine, one that protects people forever against all flu viruses?

“I personally think that is just too tall of an order,” Taubenberger said.

“What this vaccine seems to do is provide protection against serious illness. You wouldn’t get pneumonia, you wouldn’t be hospitalized or die. You might get a mild illness for a few days and recover.” It might also limit how much you spread the virus around to others, he said.

Most of the next-generation flu vaccines aren’t going for the gold, but instead aim to improve on seasonal influenza vaccine approaches.

One vaccine in the works makes use of one of the less-changeable parts of the flu virus called M2. The ReDee vaccine made by FluGen, a spinoff from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, is not meant to be a completely universal vaccine, but might protect better against a range of flu strains.

It’s a genetically engineered whole virus, one that causes a limited infection in the body. It’s squirted up the nose, and phase 2 studies in people start this year. These studies aim to show that the vaccine is both safe and works as intended.

Another approach uses a pill instead of a needle. The VXA-A1.1 vaccine being made by VaxArt doesn’t use eggs but employs an extra ingredient called an adjuvant to stimulate the immune system. The company just finished a phase 2 study in people who agreed to try the pill vaccine and then be deliberately exposed to flu. It reduced the infection rate by 48 percent — not a home run, but better than the 38 percent reduction in people who got a standard seasonal flu vaccine.

What this vaccine seems to do is provide protection against serious illness.

Canada-based Medicago uses virus-like particles that more precisely match circulating flu strains. Medicago’s are grown in tobacco plants, which the company hopes will mean fewer mistakes in production and much quicker production time.

The Medicago vaccine is in phase 3 studies, the last stage of human experiments before a company seeks approval to actually sell a drug or vaccine. The company says so far, the vaccine is safe and produces a robust immune response, but it has not conducted studies in which people are challenged with flu to see how well it works in a real-world situation.

The company is hoping to have it on the market by the 2020 flu season.

It’s expensive to develop any new drug and often more expensive to develop new vaccines, which must pass extra hurdles of safety because they are used in healthy people.

A pill that protects people from the AIDS virus may be driving down use of condoms, Australian researchers reported Wednesday.

They found that as more people used the daily pill, called PrEP, the less likely they were to use condoms.

It’s not clear what this means, the researchers wrote in the Lancet medical journal. But the fears are that availability of the pills could feed a false sense of security, and that dropping condom use will help fuel the already widening epidemics of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as syphilis and gonorrhea.

There are also fears that rates of new HIV infections could go back up if people stop using condoms and do not use PrEP consistently.

But some activists said it’s a positive trend and will help remove the stigma surrounding gay and bisexual sex.

PrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Researchers found that taking HIV drugs can protect people who are not infected from acquiring HIV. The most common brand name is Truvada, a once-a-day pill.

PrEP can reduce the risk of catching HIV by 90 percent if people use it consistently. It's been on the market since 2012 and has been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2014.

“PrEP has been heralded as a game-changer for HIV, but declining condom use may impede its long-term population-level effectiveness,” Martin Holt at the University of New South Wales in Sydney said in a statement.

Holt and colleagues surveyed nearly 17,000 gay and bisexual men in Sydney and Melbourne between 2013 and 2017, before and after a large campaign to encourage PrEP use.

By 2017, 24 percent of HIV-negative men were using PrEP, they found.

Between 2013 and 2017, the consistent use of condoms fell from 46 percent of men in 2013 to 31 percent in 2017.

“A rapid increase in PrEP use by gay and bisexual men in Melbourne and Sydney was accompanied by an equally rapid decrease in consistent condom use,” Holt and colleagues wrote.

Their findings fit with other research done, especially a 2016 study in San Francisco that found similar trends.

“The long-term consequences of this shift in community practice are unknown (eg, the potential for HIV transmission to rebound in HIV-negative and untested men not using PrEP).”

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects 36 million people globally and it has killed 35 million people since it began spreading in the 1970s, according to the World Health Organization.

In the United States, more than 1.2 million people have HIV, and about 50,000 people are newly infected each year.

It killed 1 million people last year, WHO says. The virus, which has no cure, is spread via sex and blood, and from mother to child at birth.

For decades, the only way to prevent its spread sexually was with consistent condom use. It ravaged gay and bisexual communities in the developed world, including the U.S., while killing mostly heterosexuals in the developing world.

PrEP is changing that. Actor Charlie Sheen's admission in 2016 that he was HIV positive and was using HIV drugs to control the infection and protect his sex partners also sparked strong interest in HIV prevention.

But studies are beginning to show that the more people know about and use PrEP, the less likely they are to use condoms.

Jim Pickett, senior director of prevention advocacy at the AIDS Foundation of Chicago, welcomes this shift.

“Let’s be frank. Lots of people don’t use condoms all the time,” Pickett told NBC News.

“This is why the U.S. government has spent billions upon billions of dollars to develop technologies that prevent HIV. Condom use is not the norm for most people in the world.”

Fears are that when people stop using condoms, STIs will spike. And statistics show that the U.S. is going through an epidemic of STIs, many of them developing resistance to antibiotics.

But Pickett says it’s likely not PrEP users who are involved in this explosive spread.

“PrEP users are seeing a clinician four times a year,” he said. “Those visits include a thorough STI screening. People on PrEP are getting excellent sexual health care.”

Frequent testing and treatment show control the spread of STIs, he said.

“If someone is on PrEP, I am very happy. That is very safe sex. It was never meant to prevent all other STIs.”

Another worry is that people will lose their fear of becoming infected with HIV, and will be more likely to have unprotected sex even if they are not using PrEP. Pickett dismisses this worry.

“Everyone is responsible for their own prevention,” he said. “No one should be relying on someone else’s behavior to protect them. If you think PrEP is protective, then you should be on PrEP.”

Cultural producer and community mobilizer Elijah McKinnon agrees. He says PrEP has helped remove the fear and stigma about HIV and the LGBTQ community.

“If someone is on PrEP, I am very happy. That is very safe sex. It was never meant to prevent all other STIs.”

“As a PrEP user myself, one thing I am very interested in is reclaiming my sexuality,” McKinnon said.

McKinnon, who is 26, was not alive to see the devastation HIV wrought before the introduction of antiretroviral drugs that control the virus. But he said he is glad to see some of the fear removed.

“For the first time, I hear people being able to breathe easy,” McKinnon said.

“While condoms are an incredibly important tool in the kit, they are just one tool — just like PrEP is just one tool,” he added. “We are entering in a time when people are becoming more sexually liberated and more comfortable in seeking out the tools they need.”",A side-effect of preventing HIV with PrEP: Less condom use,http://nbcnews.com/health/health-care/side-effect-preventing-hiv-prep-less-condom-use-n880711

Spending on cancer drugs has doubled over the past five years, and little wonder: Every new cancer drug brought to market last year cost $100,000 or more, according to a new report.

The average cost of a new drug released in 2017 was $150,000, according to the report from The IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science, formerly IMS Health and Quintiles.

Those drug costs are expected to double again by 2022, the report finds. That compares to the average $79,000 cost of new cancer drugs that hit the market in 2013.

“Global spending on cancer medicines — both for therapeutic and supportive care use — rose to $133 billion globally in 2017, up from $96 billion in 2013,” the report reads.

But despite outrage among consumers and a focus on drug costs from the Trump administration, cancer patients with commercial health insurance pay on average of $500 out of pocket a year for these drugs, the report finds.

“For retail drugs, the extensive use of coupons helps offset patient out-of-pocket costs,” the report reads.

David Mitchell, a cancer patient who founded the group Patients for Affordable Drugs, said if health insurance companies are shouldering these costs, they’re passing them along to customers in the form of higher premiums.

“Worse, these drugs are almost always built on science paid for by taxpayers through the NIH (National Institutes of Health). So we wind up paying twice — once to invent the drug and again when it comes to market,” he said.

Plus, coupons cannot be used by patients on Medicare, the federal health insurance plan for just about everyone over 65. “So there is no help for patients on that front,” Mitchell said.

“Moreover, the savings from coupons outside of Medicare are more than made up for with increased prices that we pay for in our premiums and taxes.”

Cancer is the No. 2 cause of death in the U.S. and in most other industrialized countries, after heart disease. But for some states, it’s the No. 1 cause of death.

The American Cancer Society predicts that 1.7 million people will be diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. in 2018, and that more than 609,000 will die of it.

While cancer rates and rates of death have been steadily dropping, drug spending will go up, the IQVIA report predicts.

“The global market for oncology therapeutic medicines will reach as much as $200 billion by 2022, averaging 10 to 13 percent growth over the next five years, with the U.S. market reaching as much as $100 billion by 2022, averaging 12 to 15 percent growth,” it predicts.

So the issue of paying for cancer drugs gets emotional.

Treating cancer has evolved considerably in recent years. Older chemotherapies were toxic and had hit-and-miss success because they relied on killing rapidly growing cells. That approach could kill tumors, but could also take out healthy tissue in the gut and, most noticeably, made hair fall out.

Targeted approaches have helped reduce toxicity and resulted in patients living longer. And targeted immunotherapies, which help the body’s own immune system scour for and destroy cancer cells, have had remarkable results in some people.

That number is limited, and the IQVIA report shows that.

“Most cancer drugs — including those with high annual costs — are used by relatively few patients, with about 87 percent of drugs being used by fewer than 10,000 patients in 2017,” the report reads.

Eight of the new drugs launched in 2017 were pills, including new drugs to treat breast cancer, lung cancer, some types of leukemia and ovarian cancer.

Two new therapies approved in 2017 are called chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies (CAR-T) and involve removing a patient’s immune cells to genetically re-engineer them. One of the treatments, called tisagenlecleucel, treats a type of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and costs $475,000 and one called axicabtagene ciloleucel treats a precursor of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and costs $373,000.

None of the new drugs is a home run. The CAR-T therapies are too new to be able to report long-term rates but for tisagenlecleucel, 76 percent of patients were still alive after a year and for axicabtagene, more than 80 percent of patients were helped to some degree for 15 months.","Cancer drug spending doubled in last 5 years, report says",http://nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cancer-drug-spending-doubles-5-years-n877236

A pill that helps control flu symptoms after one dose is getting fast consideration from the Food and Drug Administration, the company that makes it said Tuesday.

Genentech said the FDA had granted priority review to baloxavir marboxil and would decide whether to approve it by the end of this year.

If approved, baloxavir would be the first new flu drug to hit the U.S. market in years and the first with a new mechanism of action in 20 years.

“Baloxavir marboxil has been shown in clinical trials to decrease the duration of symptoms with one dose, and demonstrated a significant reduction in viral shedding in just one day,” said Dr. Sandra Horning, chief medical officer at drug giant Roche, which owns Genentech.

Influenza viruses developed resistance long ago to the first two antiviral flu drugs, amantadine and rimantadine.

Newer antiviral drugs on the market include Tamiflu, a pill; Relenza, which can be inhaled; and an injectable drug called peramivir.

All three are in a class called neuraminidase inhibitors. They help stop the virus from spreading inside the body and work best when given within a day or so of symptoms starting.

Even if the antivirals don’t cure flu the way an antibiotic can cure strep throat, they’re still useful, the CDC says. They reduce how long people are sick with flu and make it less likely to kill them. Tamiflu can also be used to prevent infection in really vulnerable groups, such as young children and nursing home residents.

Baloxavir, already approved for use in Japan, works in a different way. It interferes with a protein inside the flu virus called cap-dependent endonuclease protein.

It helps stop virus replication, also, but earlier on in the process. ""It inhibits the virus much earlier in the influenza life cycle,"" said Genentech vice president Mark Eisner.

""It's going to be more convenient than the neuraminidase inhibitors because it works after a single dose,"" Eisner told NBC News.

A 2016-2017 study in 1,436 people in the U.S. and Japan showed the one-dose pill cut the time people were sick to 2.5 days from about 3.3 days. It cut how long people had a fever from an average of 42 hours to just one day and reduced what’s called viral shedding from four days to just one day.

Reducing viral shedding should, in theory, limit the spread of the virus from person to person, although the company has not shown that.

It did not cause many side-effects.

The company has continued testing it in more people, including people at high risk of flu complications, and is analyzing the results now, Eisner said.

Tamiflu is now recommended for children and people who have a high risk of flu, but patients must take multiple doses over several days. Relenza is less commonly used, but it and peramivir are more useful for hospitalized patients who may be unable to take pills.

Doctors like having a variety of drugs on hand for any disease, but especially influenza, which mutates quickly and which can develop resistance to drugs. In 2009, for instance, the H1N1 swine flu strain developed resistance to Tamiflu.

Baloxivir is sold in Japan by its inventor Shionogi & Co. under the name Xofluza. Genentech has not said what the U.S. name would be if the FDA approves it.

“The FDA is expected to make a decision on approval by December 24, 2018,” the company said. Company representatives said it was too soon to talk about a name for the U.S. product or what it might cost.","New, fast-acting flu drug gets priority FDA review",http://nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-fast-acting-flu-drug-gets-priority-fda-review-n886611

The U.S. is in the midst of its deadliest drug epidemic ever. While overdose deaths have been the main concern, some studies have noted HIV and hepatitis C infections are spreading among drug users. The authors say the new report is one of the first — and the largest — to highlight how superbug bacterial infections are spreading, too.

MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, often live on the skin without causing symptoms. But they can become more dangerous if they enter the bloodstream, destroying heart valves or causing other damage. Health officials have tied MRSA to as many as 11,000 U.S. deaths a year.

Public health efforts have focused on MRSA's spread in hospitals and nursing homes, and infection-control campaigns have been credited for recent drops in MRSA infections at health care facilities.

But as that success story has unfolded, MRSA infections tied to illicit drug use have risen.

The opioid epidemic began with abuse of prescription pain pills, but in recent years has shifted to heroin and other injectable drugs.

MRSA ""is on the skin, and as the needle goes into the skin it brings the bacteria with it,"" explained Dr. Isaac See of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, another of the study's authors.

The proportion of invasive, bloodstream-infecting MRSA cases that occurred among injection drug users more than doubled in five years, the study found. In 2011, 4 percent of those MRSA cases involved injection drug users; in 2016, the proportion was 9 percent.

The report is based on infections diagnosed at hospitals across Connecticut and in parts of California, Georgia, Minnesota, New York and Tennessee. Data were collected from 2005 through 2016.

Half of Americans over the age of 65 who are in a relationship are sexually active, according to a new poll. But not many of either half — the older Americans who are having sex and the ones who aren’t — are talking about it with their partners or their doctors.

That's a problem because many older adults take over-the-counter supplements that might interact with their prescription medications. Nearly 20 percent of men and 3 percent of women between ages 65 and 80 years old reported taking medications or supplements to improve sexual function in the past two years. Some of these supplements may be prescription medications, but others may be not be FDA approved.

Abortion rates have fallen over the past 25 years, even as more countries have made the procedure legal and easier to get, according to a new report released Tuesday.

Countries with the most restrictive abortion laws also have the highest rates of abortion, the study by the Guttmacher Institute found. Easier access to birth control drives down abortion rates, the report also finds.

The report finds about 56 million abortions occur every year — nearly 50 million of them in developing countries. About a quarter of all pregnancies end in abortion.

Because there are so many women of childbearing age, the number of abortions has gone up, but the rates per 1,000 women have fallen, the report found.

Switzerland had the lowest abortion rate at 5 per 1,000 women. The U.S. rate is 13 per 1,000 women, the same as Britain's, the report found. Colombia and Mexico had abortion rates of 34 per 1,000 women. Pakistan’s estimated abortion rate was the highest at 50 per 1,000 women.

""Abortions take place around the world, no matter the legal setting,"" the report reads. But, it adds, “Provision of abortion is safest where it has long been legal.""

“Nonetheless, some countries with broadly liberal laws have increasingly added restrictions that chip away at access to legal procedures; these include the United States and several countries in the former Soviet Bloc or zone of influence.”

The Trump Administration has embraced a conservative-led movement to limit abortion rights in the U.S.

Earlier this week, Mississippi’s governor signed a law banning most abortions after 15 weeks gestation, although a federal judge blocked the law Tuesday.

And the Trump Health and Human Services Department has reversed Obama era policies that made contraception more freely available and that used evidence-based approaches to fight teen pregnancy — over the objections of career health officials.

A 2012 study of more than 9,000 women found that when women got no-cost birth control, the number of unplanned pregnancies and abortions fell by between 62 and 78 percent. But political appointees at HHS advocate for abstinence-only approaches, which have been shown not to affect unplanned pregnancy rates.

The report from Guttmacher, which studies reproductive health issues, found rates of both abortions and of unintended pregnancies have fallen worldwide.

“Improved contraceptive use, and in turn, declines in unintended pregnancy rates are the likely driver behind the worldwide decline in abortion rates,” Susheela Singh, vice president for international research at the Guttmacher Institute, said in a statement.

“Most women who have an abortion do so because they did not intend to become pregnant in the first place. Meeting the need for contraception is critical to bringing down rates even further.”

The report found abortion rates vary greatly region by region. Much of the reduction in abortions overall follows changes in the former Soviet Union, with policies encouraging contraception over abortion.

The highest abortion rates are now found in Latin America and the Caribbean, where abortion is strongly restricted legally.

“Highly restrictive laws do not eliminate the practice of abortion, but make those that do occur more likely to be unsafe,” the report reads.

The report’s findings echo those from the National Academy of Medicine last week. It found that, despite claims from some anti-abortion-rights officials, abortion care is overwhelmingly safe in the U.S. It found that abortions can be safely provided in clinics and doctor’s offices.

“In many states, regulations have created barriers to safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable abortion services,” the report reads.

“Abortion is among the most regulated medical procedures in the nation,” it adds.

“Having an abortion does not increase a woman’s risk of secondary infertility, pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders, abnormal placentation, preterm birth or breast cancer.”

The Guttmacher and National Academies reports agree that making it more difficult to get abortions forces women to get them at a later stage, when they will be more complicated, expensive and risky.

Guttmacher found when that happens to women in developing nations, they often turn to “traditional” methods which include:

Inserting sticks, roots, bones, wires, ground seeds or chemicals into the uterus;

Instilling bleach, saltwater, detergent or soap into the uterus;

Drinking alcohol, detergent, bleach, tea or herbs;

Taking aspirin, painkillers, laxatives, hormones or other medications;

Beating or pushing on the abdomen or jumping from heights;

Blowing air into the vagina or placing a hot stone on the abdomen to “melt” the fetus.

“Not only do these methods often fail, they can lead to severe complications,” the report concludes.",Abortion rates go down when countries make it legal: report,http://nbcnews.com/health/health-care/abortion-rates-go-down-when-countries-make-it-legal-report-n858476
470,470,,nbcnews.com,"An international team of researchers looked at data from 600,000 people in 19 countries, who were asked about drinking habits dating back as long ago as 1964. They were followed for years afterward.

People who reported drinking more had higher rates of stroke, heart disease, deadly high blood pressure and fatal aortic aneurysms, the team reported in the Lancet medical journal.

“The paper estimates a 40-year-old drinking four units a day above the guidelines has roughly two years lower life expectancy,” said David Spiegelhalter, a risk expert at Britain’s University of Cambridge who was not involved in the study.

“This works out at about an hour per day. So it’s as if each unit above guidelines is taking, on average, about 15 minutes of life, about the same as a cigarette. Of course it’s up to individuals whether they think this is worthwhile.”

The most people can get away with and not raise their risk of early death was about five glasses of wine a week or the equivalent, the researchers found.

Many people can drink far more than that in a single day. The CDC says more than 38 million American adults admit to binge-drinking once a week and guzzle an average of eight drinks per spree.

""The key message of this research for public health is that, if you already drink alcohol, drinking less may help you live longer and lower your risk of several cardiovascular conditions.""

The CDC says that more than 2,000 Americans die each year from acute alcohol intoxication.

It’s no secret that alcohol can be bad for health in other ways, too. Drinking raises the risk of both cancer and heart disease, and one study suggested that drinking accounts for 15 percent of breast cancer cases.

The risk starts rising with as little as one drink a day on average.

The American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund recommend in a joint report that people limit alcohol.

People who do not drink at all can have worse health, also — something that can confuse consumers and doctors alike. So the researchers, led by Cambridge University’s Dr. Angela Wood, used only information about people who were current drinkers “because ex-drinkers include people who might have abstained from alcohol owing to poor health itself, as well as those who have changed their habits to achieve a healthier lifestyle,” they wrote.

They found that the more people drank, the higher their risk of death compared with people who drank less.

If a 40-year-old man dropped his intake from two drinks a day to around five drinks a week, he could expect to add an average of a year or two to his life, the researchers projected.

""We should always remember that alcohol guidelines should act as a limit, not a target.""

What’s the safest drink? It might be wine, sipped a little at a time, the study suggested.

""Exploratory analyses suggested that drinkers of beer or spirits, as well as binge drinkers, had the highest risk for all-cause mortality,"" the researchers wrote.

""The key message of this research for public health is that, if you already drink alcohol, drinking less may help you live longer and lower your risk of several cardiovascular conditions,"" Wood said in a statement.

""We should always remember that alcohol guidelines should act as a limit, not a target, and try to drink well below this threshold,” said Victoria Taylor, a senior dietitian at the British Heart Foundation.

The study’s likely to be controversial, said Jason Connor and Wayne Hall of the University of Queensland Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research in Australia.

""The drinking levels recommended in this study will no doubt be described as implausible and impracticable by the alcohol industry and other opponents of public health warnings on alcohol,” they wrote in a commentary.

“After adjusting for differences in age, the rate of suicide in 2015 was 2.1 times higher among veterans compared with nonveteran adults,” the report reads. Data for 2015 was the latest complete set of numbers available.

The rate was 1.3 times higher for male veterans compared with civilians and twice as high for female vets, the report found.

Suicides are up across the country. Report after report finds that they are becoming more common among men, women and children. It’s not clear why, but psychiatrists and suicide experts say it’s probably a combination of factors — a lack of access to mental health care, a growing sense of disconnection in society, economic woes and relationship problems.

At least one study showed that among veterans, quick turnarounds between deployments, or deploying military personnel too early, raised the risk of suicide.

472,472,,nbcnews.com,"“Our study shows that World Trade Center exposure may be a risk factor for the development of multiple myeloma and its precursor disease,” the team wrote in the report, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association’s JAMA Oncology.

“We observe striking patterns,” Dr. Ole Landgren of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and colleagues added.

“We found the median age of multiple myeloma diagnosis to be 57 years, which is roughly 12 years younger than what is seen nationally,” they added.

They also found that more of the men than would otherwise be expected had a pre-cancerous condition called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), which can progress to myeloma.

But Dr. Otis Brawley of the American Cancer Society was cautious about assuming too much from the findings.

“These trials, because of the size of cohort, cannot identify a small increase in cancer risk due to World Trade Center exposure, and correlation does not mean causation,” Brawley wrote in a commentary.

“Perhaps this issue is beyond the limits of science.”

The same team found in 2011 that firefighters had a higher risk of cancer — helping answer a question that had been fought out in the courts for years as first responders sought compensation and care for the after-effects of the disaster.

“We wanted to find early, predictive signs of cancer that would allow us to screen people and monitor those found to be at risk. By detecting MGUS, which predicts the development of multiple myeloma, we are able to do that,” said Dr. David Prezant of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who worked on the study.

“Screening for multiple myeloma risk by testing for MGUS is something we can offer these first responders, which is why this study is important.”

They found 16 firefighters with multiple myeloma, which is about 1.8 times more than found in a similar population of white men in Rochester, Minnesota.

The researchers also analyzed cancer cases to date among the firefighters, compared them to similar New Yorkers, and projected how many more cases of cancer might be expected.

The firefighters are treated as part of the Fire Department of New York’s World Trade Center Health Program.

“We project that the FDNY-WTCHP cohort will experience a greater cancer burden than would be expected from a demographically similar population,” the researchers wrote.

“This underscores the importance of cancer prevention efforts and routine screening in WTC-exposed rescue and recovery workers.”

It wasn’t a big increase — a projected 2,714 cases among white male firefighters, compared to 2,596 among similar white male New Yorkers.

“Those who performed work at the WTC site may be at increased risk for prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, and melanoma owing to their exposure to carcinogens in the WTC dust,” the researchers wrote.

It was widely expected that first responders and survivors of the attacks might have a higher cancer risk.

“Many WTC first responders were initially exposed to aerosolized dust and toxic fumes from burning jet fuel and building materials,” the researchers wrote.

This dust included pulverized cement, glass fibers, asbestos, lead, cancer-causing compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or PAHs, polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs, polychlorinated furans and dioxins.

“For the next 10 months of the rescue, recovery, and cleanup effort, responders were exposed to burning subterranean fires that released trapped gases and dust, and were not extinguished until the end of December,” the researchers wrote.

“The final insult included diesel fuel combustion byproducts from heavy equipment used at the site.”

The dust and chemicals could also cause chronic inflammation, which can lead to cancer, they said.

Brawley said it’s a natural response to think so, but he is not convinced by the numbers in the studies.

“This underscores the importance of cancer prevention efforts and routine screening in WTC-exposed rescue and recovery workers.”

“The WTC attack is an emotional subject. Cancer is also an emotional subject,” he wrote.

“There is a tendency to want to blame something for every diagnosed cancer. We often attribute cancer to some environmental exposure. When these WTC heroes are diagnosed as having a cancer, even a cancer common in the population, there is a natural tendency to assume it is due to their service at the WTC.”

But Brawley also said the first responders deserved respect. “They should also be compensated for all the injuries associated with their service and given the best care possible,” he wrote.

Close to 70,000 responders are enrolled in the World Trade Center Health Program, which provides monitoring and treatment for people involved in the 9/11 attacks. The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people, including more than 400 firefighters and other first responders.

The Food and Drug Administration approved a new migraine drug on Thursday.

Aimovig, known generically as erenumab, is the first drug in a new class of headache medicines. It's been shown to stop migraine headaches before they start.

The drug would be approved for patients who have tried other drugs and found no relief. In studies, it did not entirely prevent migraines, but reduced their frequency.

“Aimovig provides patients with a novel option for reducing the number of days with migraine,” said Dr. Eric Bastings, deputy director of the FDA's neurology products division.

“We need new treatments for this painful and often debilitating condition.”

FDA's approval means the drug may soon be available under prescription. It should also be paid for by health insurance.

The drug's maker, Amgen, said U.S. list price is for the once monthly self-injection treatment will be $575 per month or $6,900 annually.

“The price of Aimovig reflects the value it brings to patients and society, including the financial impact on sufferers, caregivers and employers, while also factoring in critical issues such as patient affordability, and fair and timely access,” Amgen said in a statement.

CHICAGO (AP) — Whether to get screened for prostate cancer is a question that men aged 55 to 69 should decide themselves in consultation with their doctors, according to finalized guidance issued Tuesday by an influential panel of health care experts.

New evidence suggests that PSA blood tests can slightly reduce the chances of dying from the disease for some men, so those decisions may be a little easier. Though screening can sometimes lead to drastic, needless treatment, the panel says that can sometimes be avoided with close monitoring when cancer is detected.

The government-appointed U.S. Preventive Services Task Force had earlier opposed routine screening. Its new guidance, echoing other groups’ advice and affirming its draft recommendations issued last year, was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

The guidance says it’s important to weigh the potential benefits and harms of screening. The test looks for elevated levels of a protein in the blood that may signal cancer but can also be caused by less serious prostate problems.

A key question is whether the patient has a higher-than-average risk for developing prostate cancer, says Dr. Michael Munger, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. These men include African-Americans and those with a family history of prostate cancer, especially if a father or brother developed the disease before age 70. These men would be the best candidates for screening.

Other important questions that should be part of the doctor-patient conversation:

The risks of screening: Elevated PSA levels don’t always signal cancer but they require a biopsy to be sure, which carries the risk of infection. If cancer is detected, patients must weigh risks of treatment, which may include radiation and surgery, sometimes resulting in incontinence and impotence.

Whether to choose treatment if cancer is detected. The panel said there’s evidence that “active surveillance,” which involves repeated PSA testing and close monitoring, can help men diagnosed with cancer avoid harsh treatment or at least delay it.

The risks of not screening, including a small chance of developing prostate cancer that could grow so slowly, patients would likely die of something else.

Age: The panel says men aged 70 and up should not be screened. For these patients, risks of screening outweigh benefits because even if prostate cancer is found, they’re more likely to die from other causes. The guidance doesn’t apply to men younger than 55 because they are considered low risk.

“It’s an awful lot to think about,” said Munger, adding that he has these complicated conversations with patients every day. “It really depends on what their feelings are and what their values are.”

The Trump administration has published its new plan for fighting teen pregnancy and its message to teens is clear: don’t have sex.

Anyone who wants federal government money to fight teen pregnancy must choose from two approaches that includes preventing teens from having sex, or persuading them to stop.

Sex education advocates say it looks a lot like the abstinence-only approach they feared it would be. And they say they don’t understand why programs that had been demonstrated to work are being tossed aside for a whole new approach.

The new directive comes in the form of what’s called a funding opportunity announcement, and it stresses “new and innovative strategies” that will focus on stopping teens from having sex at all.

The announcement from the Office of Adolescent Health, part of the Health and Human Services Department, is an invitation for groups to ask the federal government for money to run their programs.

“Both risk avoidance and risk reduction approaches can and should include skills associated with helping youth delay sex as well as skills to help those youth already engaged in sexual risk to return toward risk-free choices in the future,” one 82-page document reads.

That doesn’t necessarily sound like bad advice, says Beth De Santis, CEO of the South Carolina Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy. It’s not the abstinence part of “abstinence-only” that worries her. It’s the “only” part.

“Every comprehensive sex education program that is worth its weight starts with abstinence,” De Santis said.

“We all know that helping kids make the best choices to stay abstinent is the best way to make sure they don’t get pregnant and don’t get a sexually transmitted infection. But that is not the choice that all teens make,” she said.

Good sex education programs also provide information about birth control, testing for STIs and on managing healthy sexual relationships, she said.

And programs that want to help stop teen pregnancy need to be open to youths who are already having sex. A no-sex-ever message could simply drive them away and out of reach of the help they need, several advocates said.

“Every comprehensive sex education program that is worth its weight starts with abstinence.""

De Santis’s group is part of a lawsuit filed against HHS over its termination last year of the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program. Two federal judges have ruled the terminations were arbitrary and capricious — most recently U.S. District Judge Thomas Rice in Spokane, Washington, on Tuesday.

Congress disregarded President Donald Trump’s budget proposal and last February allocated more than $100 million to the Office of Adolescent Health (OAH) for teen pregnancy programs.

“Congress funded it and this is the answer,” said Diana Thu-Thao Rhodes, director of public policy with Advocates for Youth, a national sex education organization.

The Funding Opportunity Announcement doesn’t dispute that current approaches have lowered teen pregnancy rates. “In 2016, teen birth rates in the United States continued to drop to a record low since their peak in the early 1990s,” it reads.

“According to the January 2018 MMWR report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the majority of teens have never had sex and the percentage of teens who have never had sex has set a new record, making this funding announcement especially relevant for reinforcing these healthy choices.”

However, the new plan doesn’t reinforce the previous approach.

“It looks as if they are trying to dismantle it from the inside out,” Rhodes said.

It steers applicants to two programs that provide tools for assessing programs.

“Applicants are expected to describe in detail how they implement protective factors and/or either elements from SMARTool or the Tool to Assess the Characteristics of Effective Sex and STD/HIV Education Programs.”

The SMARTool was developed by the Denver-based Center for Relationship Education, which developed a sex and relationship education program that criticizes contraception-focused sex education and that includes Christian and faith themes. It embraces the idea that talking about safe sex ""normalizes"" sexual behavior among teens.

The second tool was developed by Education, Training and Research Associates — a group that has in the past pointed to the shortcomings of abstinence-only education and that favors a comprehensive approach.

But Dr. Amy Collins, an adolescent medicine physician in Pittsburgh and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, said she believes the Trump Administration has made its intentions clear.

“My sense is that abstinence only is still the ultimate goal,” Collins said.

HHS does provide some guidance.

“It looks as if they are trying to dismantle it from the inside out.""

“Projects will clearly communicate that teen sex is a risk behavior for both the physical consequences of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections as well as sociological, economic and other related risks,” the document reads.

HHS did not provide an interview but sent NBC News an emailed statement.

“HHS included two programs that span the continuum of sex education and teen pregnancy programs between sexual risk avoidance and sexual risk reduction. The elements contained in each of these two model programs are widely accepted as important elements for the successful implementation of youth programs,” an HHS spokeperson said in the statement.

New administrations often take different approaches with policies, but experts at state, local and national teen pregnancy prevention groups all agreed this funding proposal changes direction radically.

“This truly is a big shift,” said Rhodes.

“It’s very different from the previous round of grants that came out of the OAH. The previous grants were very evidence-driven,” she added.

Under eight years of the Obama administration, specific curricula were provided, along with evidence about whether and how they were effective.

“Why should our communities be asking for another grant when we don’t even know the reason why our grant was terminated?” asked Dr. Leana Wen, the Baltimore City Health Commissioner who is part of the lawsuit against HHS.

“Look at the science. Follow the evidence and the science. We’ve made tremendous gains. Don’t roll back the clock,” Wen added.

HHS officials have said previous programs do not work, but Kane pointed out that HHS published an evidence review Monday of those programs that shows many of them did.

“The approach in this funding announcement puts ideology over evidence and as a result it puts our most vulnerable young people at risk,” said Andrea Kane of Power to Decide, a national organization dedicated to preventing unplanned pregnancy.

“It really walks away from some of the high-quality notions of evidence and evaluation,” she said.",New Trump teen pregnancy approach stresses abstinence,http://nbcnews.com/health/health-care/new-trump-teen-pregnancy-approach-stresses-abstinence-n869141

A pill that helps control flu symptoms after one dose is getting fast consideration from the Food and Drug Administration, the company that makes it said Tuesday.

Genentech said the FDA had granted priority review to baloxavir marboxil and would decide whether to approve it by the end of this year.

If approved, baloxavir would be the first new flu drug to hit the U.S. market in years and the first with a new mechanism of action in 20 years.

“Baloxavir marboxil has been shown in clinical trials to decrease the duration of symptoms with one dose, and demonstrated a significant reduction in viral shedding in just one day,” said Dr. Sandra Horning, chief medical officer at drug giant Roche, which owns Genentech.

Influenza viruses developed resistance long ago to the first two antiviral flu drugs, amantadine and rimantadine.

Newer antiviral drugs on the market include Tamiflu, a pill; Relenza, which can be inhaled; and an injectable drug called peramivir.

All three are in a class called neuraminidase inhibitors. They help stop the virus from spreading inside the body and work best when given within a day or so of symptoms starting.

Even if the antivirals don’t cure flu the way an antibiotic can cure strep throat, they’re still useful, the CDC says. They reduce how long people are sick with flu and make it less likely to kill them. Tamiflu can also be used to prevent infection in really vulnerable groups, such as young children and nursing home residents.

Baloxavir, already approved for use in Japan, works in a different way. It interferes with a protein inside the flu virus called cap-dependent endonuclease protein.

It helps stop virus replication, also, but earlier on in the process. ""It inhibits the virus much earlier in the influenza life cycle,"" said Genentech vice president Mark Eisner.

""It's going to be more convenient than the neuraminidase inhibitors because it works after a single dose,"" Eisner told NBC News.

A 2016-2017 study in 1,436 people in the U.S. and Japan showed the one-dose pill cut the time people were sick to 2.5 days from about 3.3 days. It cut how long people had a fever from an average of 42 hours to just one day and reduced what’s called viral shedding from four days to just one day.

Reducing viral shedding should, in theory, limit the spread of the virus from person to person, although the company has not shown that.

It did not cause many side-effects.

The company has continued testing it in more people, including people at high risk of flu complications, and is analyzing the results now, Eisner said.

Tamiflu is now recommended for children and people who have a high risk of flu, but patients must take multiple doses over several days. Relenza is less commonly used, but it and peramivir are more useful for hospitalized patients who may be unable to take pills.

Doctors like having a variety of drugs on hand for any disease, but especially influenza, which mutates quickly and which can develop resistance to drugs. In 2009, for instance, the H1N1 swine flu strain developed resistance to Tamiflu.

Baloxavir is sold in Japan by its inventor Shionogi & Co. under the name Xofluza. Genentech has not said what the U.S. name would be if the FDA approves it.

“The FDA is expected to make a decision on approval by December 24, 2018,” the company said. Company representatives said it was too soon to talk about a name for the U.S. product or what it might cost.","New, fast-acting flu drug gets priority FDA review",http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/new-fast-acting-flu-drug-gets-priority-fda-review-n886611

Long touted for its role in keeping bones strong — vitamin D also may be important in preventing colon cancer.

New research from the American Cancer Society and other public health groups finds people with higher than recommended blood levels of vitamin D have a lower risk of developing colorectal cancer. The finding was particularly significant for women.

The opposite may also be true: people with a vitamin D deficiency were found to have an increased risk for the disease.

The new research project combines data on more than 12,000 people in Europe, Asia and the U.S.

“Participants who had vitamin D levels that were higher than the recommended levels had a statistically significant 22 percent lower risk of colorectal cancer,” said Marjorie McCullough, senior scientific director at the American Cancer Society.

But some outside experts say more research is needed before doctors recommend vitamin D supplements specifically for colon cancer prevention.

Dr. Zhaoping Li, director at the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, said the research is informative, but does not prove increasing vitamin D levels would prevent colon cancer. Instead, “this gives us a good reason to invest time and effort to see whether vitamin D can have an impact on colon cancer incidence,” said Li.

“This is not the smoking gun,” she said. Li was not involved with this latest American Cancer Society study.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. And there’s been a worrisome rise in the number of younger adults diagnosed with the disease.

That’s why the American Cancer Society recently lowered the recommended age to begin colorectal screening from 50 to age 45. It’s one of the few cancers that can be prevented with screening tools like colonoscopy.

But could vitamin D be another path to prevention? Dietary guidelines suggest most adults get at least 600 international units (IU) of vitamin D a day. This new research finds even larger amounts would offer stronger protection against colorectal cancer. However, study authors warn there’s a limit on the apparent benefit.

“It's worth noting that people who had the highest levels that we looked at did not continue to see a lower risk of colorectal cancer, so there does appear to be this sweet spot,” said McCullough.

It’s unclear where that sweet spot is, though.

True cancer prevention likely comes from multiple lifestyle changes: exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking and a healthy diet rich in fiber, as well as, yes, vitamin D.

Li almost always recommends at least 1,000 IU a day. She said there’s emerging evidence that vitamin D not only regulates calcium for bone health — it also may impact the immune system and cell growth.

Sunlight is the easiest way for the body to absorb D, but of course too much UV light can increase the risk for skin cancer. Experts say casual exposure to the sun — a short walk down the street or running to catch a bus, for example — is generally sufficient.

Vitamin D is also found in a few foods: cod liver oil, fatty fish like salmon, tuna, egg yolks and fortified cereal, milk and orange juice.

Experts aren’t suggesting everyone should rush to their doctors to get their vitamin D levels checked.

“People who are at higher risk of having lower levels are people who are never exposed to the sun, people who have dark skin who live in northern latitudes, and who don't eat the foods that are fortified by vitamin D and who don't like fatty fish,” said McCullough.

The American Cancer Society predicts more than 140,000 people will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer this year, and more than 50,000 will die from the disease.","Vitamin D may lower colon cancer risk, especially in women, study finds",http://nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vitamin-d-may-lower-colon-cancer-risk-especially-women-study-n882916

Gleevec, the daily pill that turned a killer type of leukemia into a manageable disease, may also help slow the worsening of diabetes, researchers reported Monday.

In a follow up to a 2008 study in which diabetic mice were cured by the drug, a team reports “modest” effects in adults with type-1 diabetes. This is the type of diabetes often called juvenile diabetes and it’s caused when the immune system mistakenly destroys insulin-producing cells called beta cells.

Tests done in 67 adults with type-1 diabetes showed the drug appeared to boost their body's own production of insulin, Dr. Stephen Gitelman of the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine told a meeting of the American Diabetes Association.

“On average the people that got the medicine used less insulin,” Gitelman told NBC News.

He stressed that it is a small trial meant to show the drug can safely do in people what it did in mice.

“We just wanted to get a sense if this showed some benefit in adults so we could get to the target population in kids,” Gitelman said.

“The conservative estimate is that beta cell function was maybe 19 percent better at one year. So it’s not a slam-dunk home run.”

The team will have to get Food and Drug Administration permission to test the drug in children.

About 5 percent of the 29 million Americans with diabetes have Type-1 diabetes.

It’s an autoimmune disease, caused when the body mistakenly destroys pancreatic cells that produce hormones like insulin and glucagon that control blood sugar. High glucose levels damage tiny blood vessels, which in turn can lead to blindness, heart disease, stroke and kidney failure. People can lose toes, feet or legs to amputation.

When levels fall too low, patients can pass out and sometimes die.

There's no cure and the only treatment is to keep blood sugar under tight control with diet and insulin.

Most people with type-1 diabetes must constantly check their blood sugar throughout the day, administering insulin according to what they are eating and how much they are exercising.

If those dying pancreatic cells could be saved, they might have to do this less often.

“That would be one potential pathway -- to use the drug to try to get in as early as possible when there are still as many beta cells remaining as possible and to slow down progression and potentially even keep people off insulin,” said Andy Rakeman, director of discovery research at JDRF, the diabetes research charity that funded the study.

“It’s estimated that people at the time they are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes that they have anywhere between 10 and 15 or maybe even 40 percent of their beta cells still remaining,” Rakeman added.

“Some people maintain beta cell function for years. We used to think all or nearly all of the beta cells are destroyed very rapidly.”

“This definitely does not show that Gleevec is curing type 1 diabetes.""

The organization is paying for research looking at several ways to preserve these cells. Gleevec would be a good candidate because it’s been around for nearly 20 years and while it causes side-effects such as a vomiting and rash, they are usually not severe in the diabetes patients.

“It’s taking an old drug and repurposing it for a new use,” Rakeman said.

Gleevec, known generically as imatinib, and Sutent, known generically as sunitinib, interfere with an enzyme called tyrosine kinase. In patients with cancers such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, cutting back on this enzyme stops the cancer.

Related: 'Bionic Pancreas' Astonishes Researchers

Cancer patients who also had autoimmune diseases who took Gleevec and Sutent reported that the drugs also appeared to ease the symptoms of the other conditions. That’s when a team at UCSF started testing Gleevec in mice bred to develop diabetes.

Gitelman says his team believes Gleevec may be taking some of the pressure off the pancreatic beta cells.

He is a little worried his study may be misunderstood. The team just finished the research last week and they’ve rushed to put together a quick presentation to the Diabetes Association meeting. It will be weeks before they can analyze the data and put it into a form that can be reviewed by other experts in a medical journal.

“It’s early and the message could be misconstrued,” Gitelman said.

“This definitely does not show that Gleevec is curing type 1 diabetes,” Rakeman stressed.

A modified version of the polio vaccine, infused straight into aggressive brain tumors, helped some patients live for years longer than they normally would have, doctors reported Tuesday.

It’s no miracle cure — only about 20 percent of patients with gliomas were helped — but some are alive six years later, the team reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.

It’s a hopeful enough finding to move forward and test the vaccine in more people, the team at the Duke University School of Medicine said.

“It’s very unusual, almost unprecedented to get this kind of long-term survival,” neurologist Dr. Darell Bigner, who led the study team, told NBC News.

The Duke team tested 61 glioma patients over five years. They all had grade IV gliomas, a group of brain tumors that includes glioblastoma.

These patients have a “dismal” diagnosis, the Duke team wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. “There is currently no effective therapy.”

Standard treatment of brain tumors includes surgery if the tumor is somewhere reachable; chemotherapy; and radiation. But if the tumor is aggressive, it’s usually fatal.

“These are people who failed everything,” Bigner said. “Virtually all patients, no matter what you treat them with, are dead within in two years.”

About a third of all brain tumors are gliomas, according to the National Brain Tumor Society. About 80,000 people a year are diagnosed with a brain tumor, and about 24,000 of those are malignant. “The average survival rate for all malignant brain tumor patients is only 34.7 percent,” the group says.

But there’s evidence that some viruses can home in on tumors and kill them. It’s not clear why, but viruses can also make tumors more visible to the immune system.

The team at Duke worked with the National Cancer Institute to design and manufacture a modified version of polio vaccine virus.

Polio viruses are attracted to nerve cells — that’s why they cause paralysis.

The medical team used polio viruses already weakened and altered for use in polio vaccines, and genetically engineered them to carry parts of a common cold virus, called a rhinovirus, known to be attracted to glioma cells.

They infused various doses into the tumors of the 61 glioma patients.

“We inject the virus directly into brain tumors and it kills all the tumor cells it comes in contact with,” Bigner said. “The most important thing is, it sets up a secondary immune response and really destroys the distant tumor cells.”

'I'm amazed'

The very first patient was Stephanie Hopper, who was diagnosed with a glioblastoma when she was just 20.

“I was throwing up and I had a headache behind my eye. I didn’t even know I had cancer until after the surgery to remove the tumor,” Hopper told NBC News. “It was the size of a tennis ball.”

Hopper was a little wary of being infused with a polio virus, but was ready to try. It worked. She’s still alive, married and working as a nurse in Greenville, South Carolina, more than six years later.

“I’m amazed,” she said. “I never really felt like I was going die. I think my life was just put on hold.”

After three years, 21 percent of patients were still alive, the team reported. That compares to 20 months or less on average for similar patients.

One patient had a hemorrhage and 19 percent had a notable adverse event, the team reported. More than half had headaches and half had hemiparesis, weakness or paralysis on one side of the body. Another 45 percent had a seizure. More than a quarter had aphasia -- brain damage that makes speaking and communication difficult.

The patient who had the hemorrhage suffered aphasia but was still alive more nearly five years later. Two patients died during the trial.

“The nature of the treatment causes side-effects,” Bigner said. “The virus infection causes a very potent inflammation response and that response causes brain swelling.”

The cancer drug Avastin is used in low doses to control the swelling, the team said.

It’s not clear why just one in five patients benefits, said Dr. Annick Desjardins, who worked on the study team.

“Similar to many immunotherapies, it appears that some patients don’t respond for one reason or another, but if they respond, they often become long-term survivors,” Desjardins said. “The big question is, how can we make sure that everybody responds?”

The Duke team compared their 61 volunteers to similar past patients who did not get the treatment. All but one of those previous patients died after an average of 11 months. Just 14 percent were still alive two years after diagnosis and 4 percent were alive three years later.

But the 21 percent or so of patients helped by the vaccine all survived at least three years.

As of March of this year, eight patients had no evidence of the tumors growing any more and two had no evidence of a brain tumor at all.",Modified polio vaccine helps fight deadly brain tumors,http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/modified-polio-vaccine-helps-fight-deadly-brain-tumors-n886486

Nine years ago, Angie Firmalino was implanted with a permanent contraceptive device called Essure. The procedure, she says, was ""extremely painful,"" and the discomfort she felt even months later — fevers, achy joints, constant bleeding — was nearly debilitating.

Firmalino eventually took her concerns to a doctor, who did an ultrasound and discovered that the implant, originally inserted in her fallopian tubes, had become dislodged and migrated to her uterus.

She was shocked. After the appointment, “I sat in my car and cried,” Firmalino, 45, of Tannersville, New York, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.

Firmalino later had the device removed, but that procedure left behind metal fragments that ravaged her reproductive system. She was alarmed that other women, unaware of the potential dangers, were still receiving the Essure implant. She started a Facebook group called Essure Problems to warn her friends and family about the device, and the group is now a forum for more than 36,000 women, some of whom say doctors, regulators and Essure’s maker have not taken their concerns seriously.

But finally, Firmalino and many of her fellow advocates were encouraged this week when the Food and Drug Administration said it would restrict the sale and distribution of Essure.

""We have been banging on the door with information and data, begging and pleading with them to do something,"" Firmalino said of the FDA.

Essure consists of two sets of small metal coils that are inserted through the vagina and cervix into the fallopian tubes. The coils are meant to cause inflammation, building up scar tissue that blocks the tubes and stops eggs from being carried from the ovaries to the uterus.

The FDA said Monday that over 15 years — Nov. 4, 2002, when Essure was approved, through December 2017 — it received 26,773 reports of problems, including pain, heavier periods and irregular bleeding, headaches and fatigue. Patients also reported that the device had become dislodged or had broken. And the agency has received reports of eight adult deaths related to Essure.

In its announcement on Monday, the FDA said Bayer, the manufacturer of Essure, can sell the device only to health care providers and facilities that guarantee women have been fully informed about its potential side effects.

Doctors must review with patients a checklist of the side effects, and both are required to sign it. (Two years ago, the FDA ordered Bayer to place a ""black box"" warning on the product package, but doctor-patient discussions were not mandatory at the time.)

FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who met with a group of Essure critics earlier this year, said in a statement that his agency is taking action because ""despite previous efforts to alert women to the potential complications of Essure, we know that some patients still aren't receiving this important information.""

""That is simply unacceptable,"" Gottlieb added. ""Every single woman receiving this device should fully understand the associated risks.""

Amanda Edwards Rusmisell, 45, of Charlotte, North Carolina, who says the pain from her Essure implant was so intense she would often cry in her sleep, hailed the FDA decision.

""We were ecstatic,"" said Edwards Rusmisell, a recruiter and an administrator of the Essure Problems group. ""We finally felt like somebody was listening.""

The FDA stopped short of outright banning Essure, though many patients would like the device taken off the medical market altogether. That would be be a rare move: The agency has only banned two medical devices: prosthetic hair fibers and powdered gloves.

Holly Ennis, a lawyer who said she represents close to 1,000 women who have filed lawsuits against Bayer over Essure, sees the FDA action as “a huge step in the right direction.”

“The requirements are so tight that they will effectively sound the death knell for the device,"" Ennis said. ""Doctors will realize it is just not worth the burden and the risk.""

In a statement, Bayer said the ""benefit/risk profile of Essure has not changed and remains positive.""

“Bayer has educated and continues to educate health care providers about the importance of appropriately counseling each patient on the benefits and risks of Essure,” the German multinational said. “The FDA requested we update the label to emphasize this point.”

More than 750,000 Essure devices have been sold worldwide since it was introduced in 2002, according to Bayer. The product, long presented as a less invasive alternative to surgical sterilization, is no longer sold outside the U.S. for “commercial reasons,” company spokeswoman Courtney Mallon said in an email. She said that decision was not related to product safety.

“Essure critics regularly attempt to paint that picture, which leads to broad dissemination of misleading and inaccurate information on social media that is directly influencing women’s choices,” Mallon said.

In the last two years, since a stronger warning was added to the box, there has been a roughly 70 percent decline in the sales of Essure in the United States, the FDA said.

Lisa Saenz, 49, a social worker who lives in New York City, received an Essure implant in 2008. She later experienced so many problems — hair loss, fatigue, stabbing pains in her side, blood clotting — that at one point, she said to herself, “I feel like I’m dying.” The coils had perforated her uterus, and she needed an operation to remove them.

In the future, she hopes Essure will no longer be sold at all.

""We don't want this offered as an option to any woman,"" Saenz said. ""Hopefully we see the end of this awful product soon.""",Women sounded alarm on Essure birth control device.

Fewer high school students are having sex than ever before, federal health officials reported Thursday. And they’re also less likely than some earlier generations to abuse drugs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s annual survey on teen behavior finds.

But kids report that bullying at school is common and a third of students report persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, the report finds. One in 10 girls and one out of 28 boys report they’ve been forced to have sex.

“Today’s youth are making better decisions about their health than just a decade ago,” said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, who directs CDC’s National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention.

“But, some experiences, such as physical and sexual violence, are outside their control and continue at painfully high levels. Their experiences today have powerful implications for their lives tomorrow.”

Every year, the CDC interviews several thousand students, choosing them to provide a nationally representative sample. The CDC cannot check whether the answers are accurate, but says the data these questionnaires generate is as acceptable as any self-reported data can be.

Condom use declining

In 2017, just 39.5 percent of the teenagers surveyed said they had ever had sex, down from 47.8 percent in 2007 and 57 percent in 1988.

Just under 10 percent said they had four or more sexual partners — something that puts people at higher risk of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV and gonorrhea. That compares to nearly 15 percent in 2007.

But barely over half had used a condom the last time they had sex, the survey found. That’s down significantly from 61 percent 10 years ago. Condoms are the only way to protect against most sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as gonorrhea and also protect against pregnancy and HIV.","Fewer teens having sex, doing drugs but more are depressed",http://nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fewer-teens-having-sex-doing-drugs-more-are-depressed-n883276

Flavored e-cigarette products and trendy new vaping devices like Juul are luring teenagers away from smoked cigarettes but keeping them hooked on nicotine, federal health officials said Thursday.

The latest tobacco use survey shows a drop in the number of high school students who use tobacco, from 24 percent in 2011 to about 20 percent in 2017.

The drop could potentially have been bigger. E-cigarettes were barely known in 2011, so virtually all teen tobacco users were smoker. Now, just under 13 percent of high school students smoke cigarettes.

Almost all of the rest are vaping, the CDC survey found.

“Since 2014, e-cigarettes have been the most commonly used tobacco product among both middle and high school students,” the CDC team, led by Teresa Wang of the Office on Smoking and Health, wrote in their report.

And the number of students who use tobacco did not change between 2016 and 2017.

“The almost flat figure on youth e-cigarette use revealed in this new CDC survey should be viewed with apprehension,” American Heart Association CEO Nancy Brown said in a statement.

“Our greatest fear is that this may be a warning sign of a reversal, and in the coming years we may see a disturbing rise in the number of middle and high school students who smoke e-cigarettes.”

So federal officials are promising to work harder to help prevent teenagers from using any tobacco products.

“We’re going to hold industry participants responsible for actions that promote youth addiction. There’s no acceptable number of children using tobacco products,” FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement.

“While fewer youth are using cigarettes and other combustible tobacco products, we must do more to address the disturbingly high number of youth who are using e-cigarettes and vaping products.”

Brown called vaping a “scary trend”.

“The tobacco industry is well aware that flavored tobacco products appeal to youth and has taken advantage of this by marketing them in a wide range of fruit and candy flavors. Their strategy is working too well, unfortunately,” she said.

The FDA has taken some actions to help reduce the sale of tobacco products to underage kids and has asked the makers of Juul to reveal some of their marketing methods to help show whether they have intentionally targeted teens.

Juul Labs says it’s begun an advertising campaign to “combat underage use.”

Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said the CDC’s survey may not reflect Juul’s popularity among kids.

“Juul was not specifically mentioned in the survey, and many teens refer to Juul use as “juuling,” indicating they may not consider it to be using an e-cigarette,” Myers said.

“Juul looks like a USB flash drive and is easy to hide, comes in sweet flavors like mango and fruit medley, and delivers a powerful dose of nicotine, putting kids at greater risk of addiction.”

Myers also said state, local and federal health officials need to continue doing what’s been shown to work to help stop kids and adults alike from using tobacco products.

“These include significantly higher tobacco taxes, comprehensive smoke-free laws, well-funded tobacco prevention and cessation programs, effective FDA oversight of all tobacco products, and hard-hitting media campaigns, like the campaigns conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FDA and Truth Initiative in recent years,” he said.

“States and localities should also continue to raise the tobacco sale age to 21, as five states and at least 320 cities and counties have now done.”

Gottlieb said it’s especially important to stop children from using nicotine of any kind.

“These figures are particularly concerning because youth exposure to nicotine — whether it comes from a cigarette or an e-cigarette — affects the developing brain and may rewire it to be more susceptible to nicotine addiction in the future,” he said.","Vaping, Juuling are the new smoking for high school kids",http://nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vaping-juuling-are-new-smoking-high-school-kids-n881121

Researchers who are trying to find a way to make wearable health technology real say they’ve taken a big step with a device that generates enough sweat to be useful.

They’ve built a prototype that generates a few drops of perspiration — enough to measure blood sugar and to monitor other bodily functions.

Researchers at Stanford University say they've taken a big step to wearable health tech with a wristband device that can measure blood sugar and other important measures of health in a few drops of sweat. Sam Emaminejad / Stanford University

It’s not ready for the market yet, but shows it is possible for people to wear lightweight devices that can deliver on the promise of pain-free diagnosis.

“You don’t stick people with anything. You can just wrap it on people’s hands and have them engage in their daily activities and you can continuously monitor them,” said Sam Emaminejad, who helped work on the device while at Stanford University.

Many groups are working to develop wearable health tech, from the glucose-sensing contact lens that Google currently has put on hold, to a so-called artificial pancreas that is really a series of linked devices that monitor blood sugar and deliver insulin as needed for diabetes patients.

Related: New Wearable Tech Could Help Blind People See

What a wearable health device needs is enough bodily fluids to measure something, such as blood sugar, sodium or hormones. The time-honored method is a needle, and anywhere from a drop to a few vials of blood.

Non-invasive alternatives would have to use sweat.

There are several problems with that, number one being whether you can measure blood sugar or look for, say hormones, in sweat. Second is getting enough sweat to measure in the first place.

The Stanford team thinks they have done that.

Related: FDA Approves First 'Artificial Pancreas'

They’ve put together sweat-stimulating compounds into a small device that delivers a low current. It can measure glucose, sodium and other compounds in the sweat and wirelessly relay that information.

“This platform extracts sweat (at a high secretion rate) on demand or periodically and performs sweat analysis in situ (in place),” they wrote in their report, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

It was not painful and could be worn strapped to the arm. “It could be like a watch,” Emaminejad, who’s now at UCLA, told NBC News.

For proof of principle, the team measured blood sugar and minerals associated with flareups of cystic fibrosis in their volunteers. Such a device might be useful for monitoring a patient’s response to drugs, they said.

“One way I think this technology can be incorporated into our daily lives is to be incorporated into a smartwatch,” Emaminejad said. The compounds that stimulate sweating and that measure the desired compounds would need regular refreshing.

“We need a clever solution. Do we need a disposable cartridge that we can insert easily?” he asked.

And researchers will have to work on better ways to correlate measurements of blood sugar, lactase, potassium and other compounds taken from sweat to what doctors know they mean when measured in blood.

The flu season is still a bad one and it’s broken a few recent records, federal health officials said Friday.

It’s not time to panic about a new pandemic — it is simply a relatively severe flu season, one that’s hitting the whole country at once instead of in waves, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.

“Influenza activity is still on the rise overall,” CDC’s acting director, Dr. Anne Schuchat, told reporters.

Ten more children have been reported to have died from flu, bringing the total for the season so far to 63.

Last season, 110 children died from flu in the U.S.

Every year, influenza kills between 12,000 and 49,000 people and can send more than 700,000 people to the hospital, the CDC says. It affects so many people that adult cases and deaths can only be estimated.

“This is a difficult season and we can’t predict how much longer the intense flu activity will last,” Schuchat said.

“This season, we are on track to break some recent records.”

Related Flu season intensifies

For one, hospitalizations are the highest they’ve been since the CDC started a new way of measuring them in 2010. And while flu usually hits people over 65 the hardest, the CDC says it’s seeing more people aged 50 to 64 being hospitalized.

And more people are showing up with flu-like symptoms — 7.7 percent of all doctor visits, which hasn’t been seen since 2003-2004, with the exception of the H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic in 2009.

With that many hospitalizations there are sure to be deaths, Schuchat said.

“We usually see the increases in influenza-like illness and hospitalizations a couple of weeks before we see what's going on with influenza deaths,” she said.

“People may have lengthy hospitalizations before they finally die of flu,” she added.

“Almost everything we are looking at is bad news.”

Most of the sickness is due to H3N2 influenza, which is notorious for causing more severe disease. Schuchat said there is no indication that the strain has mutated in some way to make it worse than usual, but scientists are looking to make sure there isn’t something unusual about it.

“This season, we are on track to break some recent records.”

And now, some states in the west are seeing a second wave of illness caused by influenza B, she said.

At any given time, several different strains of flu will be circulating and this year the four major strains that are include H3N2, H1N1 and two different strains of influenza B. Vaccines protect against three or four strains and Schuchat said it is still not too late to get a vaccine.

People who have had flu once can get sick again from a second strain, and people who have already had flu might protect themselves from catching it again if they get vaccinated, she said.

Related Why a bad flu season is good for flu vaccines

There is some good news. There is still plenty of medication to go around, Schuchat said, even though some pharmacies may not have enough in stock.

People at high risk of flu complications, such as the very young, the very old, people with asthma, diabetes or other conditions should not wait. If it looks like flu, it probably is, Schuchat said, and taking medication early in its course can make the difference between a mild bout of flu and going to the hospital.

“We do want clinicians to know that if a person looks like they have flu, don’t wait for the tests results,” she advised.","Flu season is breaking records, CDC says",http://nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-season-breaking-records-cdc-says-n846341

At first, Kelly Leggett wasn't bothered by the mole behind his right ear. It was getting bigger and oozing, but because he had no other symptoms, his doctor told him not to worry. Four years later — after the mole kept changing — Leggett finally went to a dermatologist for a biopsy.

In July 2007 he was diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma. A chest X-ray he received after the biopsy also came back abnormal — the cancer had spread to his lymph nodes, lungs, spine, liver, spleen and pelvis.

Leggett was stunned. “I went in to remove a mole for cosmetic reasons,"" said Leggett, who had gone on a 20-mile bike ride just days before his diagnosis. ""I knew nothing about melanoma. It’s surprising to know that something can progress to that level and you don’t even know it.”

“Growing up in the 1960s and 1970s, we had a different relationship with the sun,"" said Kelly Leggett, who was diagnosed with melanoma when he was 45. ""We didn’t think we looked good or “healthy” unless we had a tan. Ironic, isn't it?"" Courtesy Kelly Leggett

Leggett, now 56, is one of a growing number of middle-aged men being diagnosed with melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. Not only are Caucasian men between the ages of 55 and 64 more likely to develop melanoma than women, they often have more aggressive forms of the disease, according to a new report from Blue Cross Blue Shield. Overall, rates of melanoma among its 41 million members are up about seven percent in the last four years. Not only are men more likely to be diagnosed with melanoma, they're also more likely to die from it, the health insurer's report found.

Why is melanoma worse in men?

It's unclear whether a higher mortality rate is because men are diagnosed later when the cancer has reached a more advanced stage or gender differences in tumor biology. Recently published data in Nature and The Skin Cancer Foundation suggest the genetics behind melanoma may play a larger role in mortality among men than previously thought.

“In my own practice I have seen a significantly higher number of men over 50 compared to women,” said Dr. Sunandana Chandra, melanoma medical oncologist at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois.

“One factor could be differences in chronic sun exposure — men traditionally have had more outdoor occupations than women and that would put them at risk for sun burn and prolonged UV radiation exposure.”

Another reason could be that men in their 50s and 60s were less likely to use sunscreen when they were younger.

“We didn’t think we looked good or ‘healthy’ unless we had a tan,"" Leggett said. ""I spent many hours in my teens and 20s laying out in the sun — put some baby oil on, burn, peel, repeat… until the tan took hold.”

Dermatologists and cancer researchers agree that the factors that lead to more skin cancer in middle-aged men is complex.

“There are many theories out there including male use of tanning beds and climate change — the ozone is less protective now allowing more UV rays to penetrate our atmosphere,"" said Dr. Carlo Contreras, surgical oncologist and assistant professor of surgery at University of Alabama Birmingham. ""UV exposure is the biggest factor for developing melanoma in a lifetime, but now we also know that the number of blistering sunburns especially in childhood contributes to long term risk of developing melanoma.”

Blue Cross Blue Shield Association

Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States, with about 9,500 people diagnosed with some form every day, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. By age 50, men are more likely than women to develop melanoma. This number jumps by age 65, making men 2 times as likely as women of the same age to get melanoma.

In 2018, over 178,000 Americans are expected to be diagnosed with melanoma. Almost half will be diagnosed with skin cancer that spreads below the top layers of skin, called invasive melanoma. Over 9,000 will die of the disease.

Melanoma is preventable by protecting the skin — wearing big hats or light clothing — or properly applying sunscreen. It is also important to perform skin examinations regularly. If a suspicious mole begins to change in shape or color, a doctor should be contacted immediately.

Foods that combine fats and carbs appear to send the human brain haywire, creating rewards above and beyond what people get from foods that contain either ingredient alone, researchers reported Thursday.

They think their experiment, using real-time brain scans, may help explain why so many of us are obese, and why we overeat even when we are not hungry.

Foods that combine fat and processed carbohydrates stimulate the brain even when people claimed they did not particularly like that food more than others, the experiment showed.

“We demonstrate for the first time that foods containing both fat and carbohydrate are more rewarding, calorie for calorie, than those containing only fat or only carbohydrate,” Small's team wrote in the journal Cell Metabolism.

And it was greater than just the effects of adding the carb response to the fat response. Foods that combined carbohydrates and fats generated a response much greater than the sum of the parts, Small said.

The team also showed which parts of the brain are responsible for this greedy response.

They recruited 206 volunteers and gave them a small amount of money — under $10 — to “bid” on snack items. They also asked their volunteers to pick their favorite foods from this list of 39 foods.

Their volunteers agreed to sit in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machines while looking over the “menu”.

""Certain foods are harder to resist.""

Some of the foods were mostly fat, like cheese cubes. Others were mostly carbs — think white bread or sugary candy. And some combined fat and processed carbohydrates — chocolate chip cookies, for instance.

The volunteers' brains were scanned as they decided how much to bid for reach snack.

“Participants are willing to pay more for fat plus carbohydrate compared with equally familiar, liked, and caloric fat or carbohydrate foods,” they wrote.

The brain regions that were the most active in making these assessments were “reward” areas including the dorsal striatum and mediodorsal thalamus.

""It one of the first studies to show that our modern foods, processed foods, are different. They are affecting our physiology differently,"" Small said.

They also asked their volunteers to estimate how many calories were in the foods offered.

“Our participants were very accurate at estimating calories from fat and very poor at estimating calories from carbohydrate,"" Small said.

Modern life can confuse the human brain, which evolved when people had to forage for food and rarely ate different foods together at the same meal, the researchers noted.

“The modern food environment proffers up nutrients in doses and combinations that do not exist in nature,” they wrote.

“This contrasts sharply with our ancestors’ diet composed mostly of woody plants and raw animal meat.”

There is no natural equivalent of a doughnut or a burger, for example.

Combining fat and carbs may overstimulate the brain’s reward mechanism much in the same way as drugs of abuse do, the researchers said.

""It's not a conscious response,"" Small said. ""It's not pleasure, so what is it? It is an unconscious signal.""

That may explain why it's so hard to resist the foods that are bad for us, she said. ""Foods in the modern environment trick those (brain) circuits,"" Small said.",Combining fat and carbs overloads the brain and makes us overeat,http://nbcnews.com/health/health-news/combining-fat-carbs-overloads-brain-makes-us-overeat-n883201

Sego lost weight and felt lethargic, and his grades suffered. Sego’s college football coach finally called his mother to ask what was going on.

“I have to watch him like a hawk because I know he is trying to save money,” said his mother, Kathy Sego.

Last year, before the states took action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, one of the nation’s most powerful federal prosecutors, issued civil investigative demands to Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi and Express Scripts, according to financial filings.

“There is enough concern about competition in the drug industry to have galvanized forces at the state and federal level to create specific pictures of abuse,” said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, after hearing of the investigative demands.

Attorneys general use the legally binding demands to collect evidence, such as documents and emails, and testimony to help “piece together any number of stories about potential competitive harm,” Moss said.

Related: Insulin Prices Skyrocket

Insulin prices have risen at regular intervals for years, Connecture’s research shows, but the trend has become more pronounced in the past few years. For example, in the final months of 2007, Sanofi’s Lantus cost $88.20 per vial and Novo Nordisk’s Levemir $90.30 a vial. Today, after increasing in tandem over the years, Lantus costs $307.20 per vial and Levemir runs $322.80 for the same amount, based on average wholesale prices.

The increases “don't all happen on the same exact day, but they happen pretty close to each other on the calendar,” said Jim Yocum, senior vice president of federal contracts with Connecture. “I don't know of any other industry where such regular price increases have been the norm.”

The United States is one of the few developed countries without regulations on prescription drug pricing. So, one of the few tools available for the government to curb price increases is to show fraudulent or anti-competitive practices.

Late last year, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) asked the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate, noting “the potential coordination by these drug makers may not simply be a case of ‘shadow pricing,’ but may indicate possible collusion.”

“I don't know of any other industry where such regular price increases have been the norm.”

Spokespeople for Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi said in separate statements that each company sets prices independently. Novo Nordisk’s Ken Inchausti added: “We monitor market dynamics and our competitors’ pricing through public and subscription databases that track list prices.”

Each of the pharmaceutical companies said it is committed to ensuring patients have access to medicine. Novo Nordisk, which makes Novolog and Levemir, also pledged to limit price increases. Eli Lilly has announced a discounted insulin program.

State and federal prosecutors often begin investigations because of consumer and whistleblower complaints, several civil and antitrust attorneys said, and gripes about rising insulin prices have been roiling the online diabetes community for the past few years.

James Tierney, former attorney general of Maine and a lecturer at Harvard Law School, said the civil investigative demands are not uncommon and the companies “may be totally innocent.”

It’s difficult to know exactly what the state and federal prosecutors are looking for, though, Tierney said. The investigations are often sealed from the public, revealed primarily when public companies acknowledge receiving them in their financial filings.

Nearly all of the federal and state officials declined to confirm or deny the investigations, except Washington and New Mexico officials, who confirmed the existence of the civil investigative demands.

Still, clues about the insulin investigations can be pieced together from corporate filings. They focus on issues like pricing and business relationships. Several ask for information about specific insulins regarding certain years.

In January — at about the same time states began filing civil demands — the first of a handful of potential class-action lawsuits that were national in scope were filed.

A U.S. district judge combined Berman’s suit and several other national cases last month, adding the pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs (Express Scripts, CVS and UnitedHealth Group with its division OptumRx) as defendants.

Berman and the other attorneys declined interview requests. But attorneys at Keller Rohrback, one of the firms whose case was rolled into Berman’s, explained the reason for adding the PBMs in a May letter to the court: “The PBM defendants play a central role in the scheme — selling formulary access in exchange for ‘rebates’ or other payments” from the manufacturers.

Rebates, or negotiated discounts, occur when a manufacturer sets a list price and then agrees to pass money back to the PBMs in return for something, generally a spot on the formulary that determines which drugs can be purchased.

The PBMs say their negotiations ensure drugs are affordable, and two of them pointed fingers back at the drug makers.

Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry declined to comment on the investigations or lawsuit but stated in an email that “if prices have gone up in lockstep, that is because they have been priced by the drug makers in lockstep.” UnitedHealth did not respond to questions. And CVS Health called the lawsuit without merit.

CVS spokesman Michael DeAngelis said in an email: “Pharmaceutical companies alone are responsible for the prices they set in the marketplace for the products they manufacture. Nothing in our agreements prevents drug manufacturers from lowering the prices of their insulin products and we would welcome such an action.”

Such lawsuits generally take years to resolve. In the meantime, the suits and the investigations may provide answers to the demands of lawmakers like Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who sent a letter to drug makers in July asking for an explanation for the “extreme price increases.”

About 14 percent of U.S adults were smokers last year, down from about 16 percent the year before, government figures show.

There hadn’t been much change the previous two years, but it’s been clear there’s been a general decline and the new figures show it’s continuing, said K. Michael Cummings of the tobacco research program at Medical University of South Carolina.

“Everything is pointed in the right direction,” including falling cigarette sales and other indicators, Cummings said.

The new figures released Tuesday mean there are still more than 30 million adult smokers in the U.S., he added.

Teens are also shunning cigarettes. Survey results out last week showed smoking among high school students was down to 9 percent, also a new low.

In the early 1960s, roughly 42 percent of U.S. adults smoked. It was common nearly everywhere — in office buildings, restaurants, airplanes and even hospitals. The decline has coincided with a greater understanding that smoking is a cause of cancer, heart disease and other health problems.

Anti-smoking campaigns, cigarette taxes and smoking bans are combining to bring down adult smoking rates, experts say.

The launch of electronic cigarettes and their growing popularity has also likely played a role. E-cigarettes heat liquid nicotine into a vapor without the harmful by-products generated from burning tobacco. That makes them a potentially useful tool to help smokers quit, but some public health experts worry it also creates a new way for people to get addicted to nicotine.

There was no new information for adult use of e-cigarettes and vaping products, but 2016 figures put that at 3 percent of adults.

Vaping is more common among teens than adults. About 13 percent of high school students use e-cigarettes or other vaping devices.

The findings on adult smokers come from a national health survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 27,000 adults were interviewed last year.",Smoking hits all-time low in U.S.,http://nbcnews.com/health/health-news/smoking-hits-all-time-low-u-s-n884621
489,489,,nbcnews.com,"But for years, parents desperate to find anything to help their children have turned to the marijuana-based products made legal by a growing number of states.

'My child was dying'

Meagan Patrick is among the parents using CBD to treat symptoms in their children. She moved from Maine to Colorado in 2014 so she could legally get CBD for her now-5-year-old daughter, Addelyn, who was born with a brain malformation that causes seizures.

“My child was dying, and we needed to do something,” Patrick said.

As for the potential approval of a pharmaceutical based on CBD, she said fear is her first reaction.

“I want to make sure that her right to continue using what works for her is protected, first and foremost. That’s my job as her mom,” Patrick said.

Advocates like Patrick became particularly concerned when GW Pharmaceuticals’ U.S. commercial business, Greenwich Biosciences, began quietly lobbying to change states’ legal definition of marijuana, beginning in 2017 with proposals in Nebraska and South Dakota.

Some worried the company’s attempt to ensure its product could be legally prescribed and sold by pharmacies would have a side effect: curtailing medical marijuana programs already operating in more than two dozen states.

The proposals generally sought to remove CBD from states’ legal definition of marijuana, allowing it to be prescribed by doctors and supplied by pharmacies. But the change only applies to products that have FDA approval.

Neither Nebraska nor South Dakota allows medical use of marijuana, and activists accused the company of trying to shut down future access to products containing cannabidiol but lacking FDA approval.

GW Pharmaceuticals never intended for the changes to affect other marijuana products, but they are necessary to allow Epidiolex to be sold in pharmacies if approved, spokesman Stephen Schultz said.

He would not discuss other places where the company will seek changes to state law. The Associated Press confirmed that lobbyists representing Greenwich Biosciences backed legislation in California and Colorado this year.

“As a company, we understand there’s a significant business building up,” Schultz said. “All we want to do is make sure our product is accessible.”

Industry lobbyists in those states said they take company officials at their word, but they still insisted on protective language ensuring that recreational or medical marijuana, cannabidiol, hemp and other products derived from cannabis plants won’t be affected by the changes sought by GW Pharmaceuticals.

Patrick Goggin, an attorney who focuses on industrial hemp issues in California, said the company would run into trouble if it tried to “lock up access” to marijuana-derived products beyond FDA-approved drugs.

“People need to have options and choices,” he said. “That’s the battle here.”

Legal experts say the changes are logical. Some states’ laws specifically prohibit any product derived from the marijuana plant from being sold in pharmacies. The FDA has approved synthetic versions of another cannabis ingredient for medical purposes but has never approved marijuana or hemp for any medical use.

Can all forms of marijuana co-exist?

A panel of FDA advisers in April unanimously recommended the agency approve Epidiolex for the treatment of severe seizures in children with epilepsy, conditions that are otherwise difficult to treat. It’s not clear why CBD reduces seizures in some patients, but the panel based its recommendation on three studies showing significant reduction in children with two forms of epilepsy.

Denver-based attorney Christian Sederberg, who worked on the GW Pharmaceuticals-backed legislation in Colorado on behalf of the marijuana industry, said all forms of marijuana can exist together.

“The future of the industry is showing itself here,” Sederberg said. “There’s going to be the pharmaceutical lane, the nutraceutical (food-as-medicine) lane, the adult-use lane. This shows how that’s all coming together.”

Alex and Jenny Inman said they won’t switch to Epidiolex if it becomes available, though their son Lukas has Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

Alex, an information technology professional, and Jenny, a preschool teacher, said it took some at-home experimentation to find the right combination of doctor-prescribed medication, CBD and THC — the component that gives marijuana users a high — that seemed to help Lukas with his seizures.

“What makes me a little bit nervous about this is that there’s sort of a psyche amongst patients that, ‘Here’s this pill, and this pill will solve things,’ right? It works differently for different people,” Alex Inman said.

The Inmans moved from Maryland to Colorado in 2015 after doctors recommended a second brain surgery for Lukas’ seizures. The couple and other parents and advocates for CBD said children respond differently to a variety of strains.

The Realm of Caring Foundation, an organization co-founded by Paige Figi, whose daughter Charlotte’s name is attached to the CBD oil Charlotte’s Web, said it maintains a registry of about 46,000 people worldwide who use CBD.

For Heather Jackson, who said her son Zaki, now 15, benefited from CBD and who co-founded the foundation, Epidiolex’s approval means insurers will begin paying for treatment with a cannabis-derived product.

“That might be a nice option for some families who, you know, really want to receive a prescription who are going to only listen to the person in the white coat,” Jackson said.",Some parents wary of cannabis-based medication for epilepsy,http://nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/some-parents-wary-cannabis-based-medication-epilepsy-n884746

Geosciences professor Julie Libarkin doesn’t wear dresses in public.

It’s not because she has to get down on the ground to do her job — she doesn’t dig up rocks — but because she cannot stand the constant harassment that comes when she does.

“I don’t wear dresses any more because almost every time I have worn a dress, I have been assaulted,” said Libarkin, who is now a full professor at of Michigan State University.

Libarkin is far from alone. More than half — 58 percent — of women in academia have been sexually harassed, the the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) says in a new report.

That makes academia second only to the military in terms of rates of sexual harassment. Nearly 70 percent of military women say they’ve been sexually harassed.

Science, technology, engineering and medicine (STEM) fields are the worst, the report finds.

It lays down a road map for universities and other academic institutions to do something about it.

“Through our work it became clear that sexual harassment is a serious issue for women at all levels in academic science, engineering, and medicine, and that these fields share characteristics that create conditions that make harassment more likely to occur,” the study group’s co-chairs, Wellesley College president Paula Johnson and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Sheila Widnall wrote in the report’s introduction.

Concrete ways to help make it stop include sending a clear message that harassment will not be tolerated; supporting women who report incidents; making investigations clear and open; and diluting the power of male superstars, who often control the careers of everyone below them.

Libarkin approves of this proposal. Academic careers often hinge on a single mentor, and that’s not good for men or women, she said.

“I would suggest that even before entering STEM, (women) use social media to build a community of people,” said Libarkin, who heads the Geocognition Research Lab at Michigan State University.

“Expand your community and recognize that mentoring doesn’t come from one person.”

Academia is especially prone to sexual harassment because of the hierarchical nature of institutions, the report says.

“Research has consistently shown that institutions that are male dominated — with men in positions that can directly influence career options of women who are subordinate to them — have high rates of sexual harassment.”

And of course, most universities and colleges are male-dominated.

“Most department chairs and deans are men. Most principal investigators are men. Most provosts and presidents are men,” the report reads.

That doesn’t mean that all men harass all women, but it’s clear that when there’s a boy’s club atmosphere, with tacit signals that sexual harassment or discrimination will be winked at, bad behavior flourishes.

“An emeritus professor came up behind me at a public retirement party on campus, bent his knees, and humped me. And, yes, I was wearing a dress,” Libarkin wrote. ""No one jumped in to rescue me, and no one seemed to have realized that I had just been assaulted.”

It’s so bad that women have started an online community to share their experiences.

Jen, who did not want to use her real name, said she suffered after she quietly asked a colleague to stop verbally harassing her.

“He must have complained,” she wrote on the #MeTooSTEM blog.

“I was then taken out of the lab by senior members who said I was not to create a bad environment for everyone, and was sent to HR (human resources) by the PI (principal investigator) with the postdoc. I now see that everyone will lie to side with who is strong and no one will defend the lower ranking woman who is being wronged.”

“Lily” says she was raped and has suffered pervasive sexual harassment, but says her worst moment was when her academic adviser asked her to be ‘the estrogen in the room’ at a meeting.

“He didn’t ask me to go because of my strong communication and negotiation skills, or because of the work I’d done leading up to this moment, or because I was co-managing the project. He asked me to go because I was a girl,” she wrote.

“This isn’t going to force anybody to do anything.”

This kind of behavior must stop, the NASEM report says.

“Academic institutions should be as transparent as possible about how they are handling reports of sexual harassment,” the report reads. Cover-ups make things worse.

“Academic institutions should consider power-diffusion mechanisms (i.e., mentoring networks or committee-based advising and departmental funding rather than funding only from a principal investigator) to reduce the risk of sexual harassment,” it adds.

And women who report harassment should be treated as “honorable and courageous,” not as trouble-makers.","Sexual harassment at universities must stop, report says",http://nbcnews.com/health/health-news/sexual-harassment-universities-must-stop-report-says-n882396

The researchers, led by Matthew Pase of the Boston University School of Medicine and colleagues, studied more than 4,000 people for their report, published in the journal Stroke.

“We found that those people who were consuming diet soda on a daily basis were three times as likely to develop both stroke and dementia within the next 10 years as compared to those who did not consume diet soda,” Pase told NBC News.

“Both sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened soft drinks may be hard on the brain.""

“Our study provides further evidence to link consumption of artificially sweetened beverages with the risk of stroke,” the team wrote.

“To our knowledge, our study is the first to report an association between daily intake of artificially sweetened soft drink and an increased risk of both all-cause dementia and dementia because of Alzheimer’s disease.”

The team did not ask people which artificial sweetener they used. Some of those in the diet drinks were likely saccharin, acesulfame, aspartame, neotame, or sucralose, the researchers said.

To their surprise, the team did not find the same risk for sugar-sweetened beverages. But they found other troubling signs. “In our first study we found that those who more frequently consume sugary beverages such as fruit juices and sodas had greater evidence of accelerated brain aging such as overall smaller brain volumes, they had poorer memory function and they also had smaller hippocampus, which is an area of the brain important for memory consolidation,” Pase said.

And other experts pointed out that sugary drinks are a major cause of obesity, diabetes, stroke and other ills.

“Both sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened soft drinks may be hard on the brain,” Dr. Ralph Sacco, chairman of the neurology department at the University of Miami, and colleagues wrote in a commentary in the same journal.

Sacco, a former president of the American Heart Association, led another study that found women who drank diet sodas had a higher risk of stroke, heart attack and other types of heart death.

“Now with the growing number of studies that suggest a relationship between artificial sweetened beverages and vascular risk, I would say reach for a bottle of water before you reach for your artificial sweetened beverages,” Sacco told NBC News.

Related: Drinking Diet Soda May Just Make You Want to Eat More

The researchers accounted for age, sex, education, overall how many calories people ate, diet quality, physical activity, and smoking. Most of the participants where white and affluent, however, and the team notes there may be others things that are also different about people who drink diet sodas.

Many may have switched to diet sodas because they had a health scare, for instance, including obesity and diabetes — both of which can raise the risk of stroke and dementia.

And Americans have been encouraged to switch to diet drinks.

“Your intake of soda and diet soda and other beverages is part of a greater pattern. There is no simple relationship between what you are eating and drinking,” said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs for the Alzheimer's Association.

Related: Could Diet Drinks Make Your Baby Fat?

Pase noted that the risks are still low and people who love their daily fix of diet soda do not need to panic.

“Even if someone is three times as likely to develop stroke or dementia, it is by no means a certain fate,” Pase said. “In our study, three percent of the people had a new stroke and five percent developed dementia, so we're still talking about a small number of people developing either stroke or dementia.”

And Fargo said the study does not point to any specific mechanism for how a diet drink might damage the brain. It’s better for people to just do what the evidence shows will improve their health overall anyway — exercise and eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains.

“There clearly is a relationship between your heart health and your brain health,” Fargo told NBC News.

""I would say reach for a bottle of water before you reach for your artificial sweetened beverages.""

“You have got to pay close attention and be diligent about dietary habits, exercise habits, controlling your blood pressure. It is not going to be simple fix like 'get rid of the diet soda,'” Fargo added. His group has recommendations online at alz.org/10ways.

Research has long shown that artificially sweetened drinks are not health drinks. While they may help people avoid more dangerous sugary sodas, studies show they don't help people lose weight.

The American Beverage Association, the lobbying group for the soda industry, said its products are safe. “The Alzheimer’s Association points out that the greatest risk factors for Alzheimer’s are increasing age, family history of Alzheimer’s, and genetics — not sugar intake, from any source,” it said in a statement emailed to NBC.

But Sacco said he’d stopped drinking diet drinks.

“I know that when we first focused our data on artificial sweetened beverages and stroke risk few years back, I stopped drinking them,” he said.

“We're not suggesting to go back to sugar sweetened beverages,” he added.

So what can people drink?

Water is always a good option, doctors agree. And of course, there’s coffee.

Work started this week on next season’s flu vaccine, with experts working off forecasts about which strains of the influenza virus will be making the rounds.

But don't expect any improvements.

Flu experts are already admitting that most vaccines will give at best mediocre protection, because they’re based on outdated technology.

It’s not a new problem, but one that the slow-moving world of drug and vaccine production seems helpless to improve upon.

“You can’t change on the drop of a dime,” said Scott Hensley of the University of Pennsylvania, an influenza virus expert.

The process of making flu vaccines starts months before the actual flu season gets under way because it takes a long time to make them using the current technology.

A yearly cocktail

In February, global flu experts gather to trade notes on what viruses are circulating in different countries and to come to a consensus on which strains the next vaccines should be formulated to target.

Every flu vaccine is a cocktail, aimed at either three or four of the most common flu strains. Flu vaccines must be reformulated every year, because flu viruses mutate constantly in a process called antigenic drift.

In recent years, flu vaccines have been based on H1N1, H3N2 and either one or two strains of influenza B virus. Each of these has a “reference” strain that has particular mutations to match the current drift.

This week, experts at the World Health Organization chose the new reference strains.

These strains are used to make seed virus. Producers inject the seed strains into eggs and incubate them as the virus grows. Then they purify the virus, and either weaken it or kill it to make a vaccine.

Using eggs is a tricky and unpredictable process. Sometimes the virus doesn’t grow well in eggs, which can mean less vaccine than anticipated. And Hensley’s lab identified several mutations that occur when flu viruses are grown in eggs as part of the vaccine-making process.

In fact, the viruses must mutate to grow in eggs, Hensley said. In some cases, the mutations make little difference in the vaccine-making process.

But in recent years, the H3N2 strains have mutated in a way that makes them harder for the human immune system to see. “The egg-adapted strains all have the mutation,” Hensley said.

Why egg-based vaccines don't work well

The result is a flu vaccine that doesn’t offer much protection. In part because of the egg mutations, this year’s flu vaccine only has provided about 36 percent protection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates. And the vaccine was overall only 25 percent protective against H3N2, meaning it lowered the risk of developing illness serious enough to go see a doctor by 25 percent.

The goal for most vaccines is 90 percent or better protection against illness.

“As long as we have eggs we are going to have this problem,” Hensley said — and other flu vaccine experts agree.

“The only solution is not to depend on eggs,” Hensley said.

There are two flu vaccines on the U.S. market that do not use eggs: Flucelvax, which is grown in canine kidney cells, and FluBlok, which uses an insect virus called a baculovirus grown in caterpillar cells.

One study published last year suggested FluBlok might have worked better than at least one of the other vaccines on the market in past year. But CDC officials say they don’t have enough data to say whether it consistently protects people better, and they do not know enough to recommend one vaccine over another.

""We're hoping this year to find out whether or not there's a performance difference between cell-based vaccines and the egg-based vaccines,"" the CDC's Dr. Daniel Jernigan told NBC News.

“The only solution is not to depend on eggs""

""Hopefully through our vaccine effectiveness networks we'll get some of that information, but it would be good to see if there is a performance difference between those vaccines.""

Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said his agency also has some “preliminary” indication that cell-based vaccines might have been more effective during the current season.

“Scientists at the FDA, CDC, and NIH are working diligently to fully understand the basis for this finding, so that all of next year’s vaccines can provide better protection in preventing the flu,” he said in a statement.

“Better understanding why the cell-based vaccine offered better protection against H3N2 this season, when compared to the egg-based vaccine, may offer important clues to help improve the production of a more effective H3N2 vaccine for next season.""

There are other reasons besides eggs that flu vaccines might not work well. The most common circulating viruses might mutate after the WHO chooses its reference strains in February. The mix of what’s circulating might change, also, and the clunky vaccine manufacturing process doesn’t allow for makers to switch gears once they’ve started.

Flu is a major killer. The CDC estimates that between 140,000 and 700,000 people get sick enough from flu every year in the U.S. to need hospital care, and the annual flu epidemic kills anywhere from 12,000 to 56,000 people a year, depending on how bad the flu season is.

The 2017-2018 season has been a severe one, hitting the entire U.S. with widespread influenza activity at once for weeks on end, and killing 97 children so far.

Against this threat, even a lousy flu vaccine is better than no vaccine. “Even an egg-based vaccine is better than nothing,” said Hensley. “Even when you have these mismatches it will not prevent infection but likely prevent disease severity.”","Why next year's flu vaccine will be lousy, too",http://nbcnews.com/health/health-news/why-next-year-s-flu-vaccine-will-be-lousy-too-n850641
493,493,,nbcnews.com,"U.S. guidelines recommend eating two to three servings of fruit a day, so the optimal fertility diet falls within normal dietary recommendations.

The team studied more than 5,500 women in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and Britain who, at the start of the study, had never had a baby.

When the women were 15 weeks pregnant, they were asked about specific foods they ate and how often. The list was detailed and included fresh fruit, leafy green vegetables, specific types of fish, burgers, fried chicken, tacos, pizza and fries.

Their records also included details on when they began trying to become pregnant.

Those who reported eating the most fast food and the lowest amount of fruit took two to three weeks longer to get pregnant than those who ate the most fruit and the least fast food, the team reported in the journal Human Reproduction.

“This supports our findings of a protective effect of fruit, but we did not find an association with green leafy vegetable or fish,” the team wrote.

“Fruits and vegetables contain a range of antioxidants and phytochemicals, and these may beneficially impact fertility,” they added.

“As we only asked about green leafy vegetables and did not ask about orange or other types of vegetables, we did not capture total vegetable intake, potentially limiting the impact they may have on fertility.”

Almost all the women conceived without fertility assistance. Most were of average weight and were 28 years old on average.

""We had quite a fertile population,"" Grieger said. ""Only 8 percent of the women were actually infertile, which is defined as taking 12 months to conceive.""

Fast food may affect fertility because of its high saturated fat content, the team speculated.

“The specific dietary components of fast food and their relationship to fertility have not been studied in human pregnancies. Fast foods are energy dense with high amounts of saturated fat, sodium and sugar,” they wrote.

It could be some of the fatty acids that are found at particularly high levels in fast food affect the egg cells, they wrote. Egg cells are high in saturated fatty acids and it's possible a woman's diet affects the balance of these fat components, Grieger said.

The team also did not question the male partners of the women but noted that other studies show a healthy diet higher in fruits and vegetables is linked with healthier sperm.

Other research has found that smoking and obesity can interfere with fertility for both men and women.

“Healthier foods or dietary patterns have been associated with improved fertility, however, these studies focused on women already diagnosed with or receiving treatments for infertility, rather than in the general population,” the researchers wrote.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention, age is a major factor in how long it takes a woman to conceive.” About one-third of couples in which the woman is older than 35 years have fertility problems,” the CDC says.

Smoking, excessive drinking, extreme eight gain or loss and extreme physical or emotional stress can also hurt fertility, the CDC says.

494,494,,nbcnews.com,"“The difficult-to-control seizures that patients with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome experience have a profound impact on these patients’ quality of life,” said the FDA’s Dr. Billy Dunn.

“In addition to another important treatment option for Lennox-Gastaut patients, this first-ever approval of a drug specifically for Dravet patients will provide a significant and needed improvement in the therapeutic approach to caring for people with this condition.”

The approval only covers use of the liquid drug for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. FDA advisers recommended the approval in April.

It is not a go-ahead for other marijuana-based products, Gottlieb stressed.

“This is an important medical advance,” he said. “But it’s also important to note that this is not an approval of marijuana or all of its components. This is the approval of one specific CBD medication for a specific use.”

It’s very different from using pure cannabis in any form.

“This is a purified form of CBD. It’s being delivered to patients in a reliable dosage form and through a reproducible route of delivery to ensure that patients derive the anticipated benefits,” Gottlieb said.

Many companies sell cannabis-based treatments, touting them as cancer cures, pain relievers and anxiety medicines. The FDA has been warning the public against falling for these unproven claims.

“The promotion and use of these unapproved products may keep some patients from accessing appropriate, recognized therapies to treat serious and even fatal diseases,” Gottlieb said.

He said the FDA would review legitimate applications for approval but said the agency needed solid scientific studies that demonstrate whether a product actually works and is safe.

“Such a process ensures that any new therapies from marijuana and its constituents are safe, effective and manufactured to a high and consistent quality and most importantly, that these products have been proven safe and effective for patients,” Gottlieb added.

The drug has been shown to reduce seizures and return a few children to near-normal function.

Dravet syndrome is a rare genetic condition that usually shows up in infants, starting with fever-related seizures and progressing to other, more severe seizure types.

“Children with Dravet syndrome typically experience poor development of language and motor skills, hyperactivity and difficulty relating to others,” the FDA said.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome also causes seizures, usually starting in children aged 3 to 5. “Almost all children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome develop learning problems and intellectual disability,” the FDA said.

“Many also have delayed development of motor skills such as sitting and crawling. Most people with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome require help with usual activities of daily living.”

Medical marijuana is legal in 29 states, Guam and Puerto Rico. Studies have shown that it can have some benefits in reducing anxiety, counteracting some types of nausea, and that it may relieve some symptoms of glaucoma and multiple sclerosis.

The FDA has approved several marijuana-based products, including the synthetic formulation Marinol, prescribed to treat severe appetite loss and nausea in conditions such as AIDS. But marijuana products in general are subject to Schedule I restrictions by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) because of the potential for abuse.

Greenwich Biosciences, the U.S. subsidiary of GW Pharmaceuticals, will sell the product.

495,495,,nbcnews.com,"WHO’s ICD-11 is used widely outside the United States for classifying all disease. In the U.S., the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is used to define mental illness. It mentions gaming disorder in its latest edition (DSM-5) but says more research is needed before listing it as a separate disorder.

“The ‘gamers’ play compulsively, to the exclusion of other interests, and their persistent and recurrent online activity results in clinically significant impairment or distress. People with this condition endanger their academic or job functioning because of the amount of time they spend playing,” it says.

Douglas Gentile of Iowa State University has done some of the influential research into the possibility of gaming addiction.

""This isn’t an issue of opinion. It’s an issue of science.""

""I and many others had assumed that the gaming is not really a problem but is a symptom of other problems,"" he told NBC News. Many thought it was somehow a failure of morals or self-control.

To see if it was, Gentile's team followed children who played games for several years.

""That's not what we found. We found that when kids became addicted, their depression increased, their anxiety increased, their social phobia increased and their grades decreased,"" Gentile said.

When kids were able to back off from obsessive gaming, their symptoms reversed, he said.

Gentile thinks medical organizations, health insurers and others should pay attention to the WHO designation.

""This isn’t an issue of opinion. It’s an issue of science,"" he said.

""This is a major scientific and medical organization. They don’t do things lightly and without reason.""

The American Psychological Association has long fought to get the WHO's ICD used over the DSM when determining health insurance coverage.

Levounis said he hoped WHO's designation would boost research that got sidelined in the 1980s, when tobacco companies, then being sued for selling addictive and deadly products, argued that tobacco was not unique and that companies should not be penalized for selling addictive products.

""They basically were saying that any behavior can be addictive,"" Levounis said. ""This whole mayhem set us back maybe 20-30 years. Now there is renewed interest and excitement.""

Why does it even matter?

In the U.S., it's important for one major reason: Health insurance won’t pay for treating someone for a disorder that doesn’t exist.

“That’s where the rubber meets the road,” said Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling.

And even if there is a designation, it can be difficult to find treatment and to get insurance companies to pay for it.

“Gambling addiction has been in the DSM since 1980 and we still struggle to get routine reimbursement,” Whyte said.

For one thing, health insurance companies don’t have to cover mental and behavioral disorders.

“This is something the Affordable Care Act was going to address but it’s still [regulated] at a state-by-state level,” Whyte said.

“What we have found is that when you are dealing with insurance companies, it depends on what state you are in and who your therapist is.”

And that presumes people even recognize that they have a problem, Whyte added.

Just as with gamblers, gamers may think they are “professionals.” That makes a gambling or gaming disorder different from a substance abuse disorder.

“You can’t become a professional drinker or a professional smoker,” Whyte said.

“But gamblers feel like the more they play, the better they get. The better they get, the more they win. So quitting is the last thing you want to do. You’re one bet away from winning everything.”

'Addiction is not about winning'

In the end, however, winning is not the goal. Someone who gambles once or twice for fun will buy an island if they win a big jackpot. A gambling addict, Whyte said, puts it right back into the game.

“Addiction is not about winning. Addiction is about staying in action,” he said.

The Entertainment Software Association has fought against any classification of gaming addiction.

""It is extremely important to note that the proposed draft circulating is not final and it is still under discussion and review,"" the organization said in a statement. It claimed that there is debate in the medical community about the designation.

Jen MacLean, executive director of the International Game Developers Association, also attacked the WHO move.

""IGDA supports responsible gaming, and we believe the WHO has done a tremendous disservice to our players, creators, and all forms of media by creating a 'gaming disorder' as a disease,"" she said.

Gentile said researchers do not necessarily believe that games themselves are somehow harmful.

""The majority of people don’t have a severe problem with it,"" he said.

But Gentile said his research shows that some children do indeed become addicted and he estimated that anywhere between 1 percent and 10 percent of kids who play games develop a disorder.

""That’s over 3 million children making serious damage to their lives because of the way in which they are gaming,"" he said.

""Until this issue gets recognized by the medical community as a legitimate problem, it will be really hard for them to get any help.""",World Health Organization adds gaming disorder to disease classifications,http://nbcnews.com/health/health-news/who-adds-gaming-disorder-disease-classifications-n884291
496,496,,nbcnews.com,"“People born in the 80s and 90s are at double the risk for developing cancer of the colon and four times the risk for developing cancer of the rectum compared to people born decades earlier like the 40s and 50s,” said Dr. Richard Wender, chief cancer control officer for the American Cancer Society.

“We're actually seeing colorectal cancer developing in people in their teens, which is something that was extraordinarily rare in the past, and it's all too common today,” Wender told NBC News.

One of those younger colorectal cancer patients is Lari Johnston of Chicago, who’s now 50. She was diagnosed with colorectal cancer when she was just 47. It had already spread — something common in younger patients who have little reason to suspect they may have cancer.

Hers was caught by a gynecologist who recommended fecal tests for all her patients over 40.

“I owe my life right now to my gynecologist for giving me that exam,” Johnston told NBC News.

“If not for that fecal occult test, I think I would be dead by now, because by the time I would have been symptomatic it would have spread too far.”

Even so, it was a terrifying diagnosis. “I feared I wouldn't even see my kids graduate from high school,” she said.

“They don’t give me a prognosis and I don’t want one. It’s stage 4. It’s a terminal illness, but who knows what’s around the corner.”

Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in Americans, according to the American Cancer Society. Colon cancer will be diagnosed in more than 95,000 people this year and nearly 40,000 will be diagnosed with rectal cancer.

The two cancers will kill more than 50,000 people this year.

Current guidelines call for people to start getting some kind of cancer screening at age 50. After consulting with experts on just how early to recommend regular screening, the ACS settled on age 45 for people at average risk, which is most Americans.

“That really is the big change in the guideline,” Wender said.

“If you have a family history or if you have inflammatory bowel disease, you're at higher risk and you need to start earlier. These guidelines don't apply to you. But for 80 percent of us — we're at average risk and the screening age is now 45.”

Any younger might mean a lot of testing with little benefit, said Dr. Daniel Labow, Chief of the Surgical Oncology Division at Mount Sinai Health System in New York.

“The problem is, you’ll be doing a lot of tests that are unnecessary,” said Labow, who was not involved in drawing up the new recommendations. “We have to balance the risk and benefit.”","Colon cancer screening should start at 45, Cancer Society says",http://nbcnews.com/health/health-news/colon-cancer-screening-should-start-45-cancer-society-says-n878331

Raymond Charles Rowe, a 49-year-old also known as ""DJ Freez,"" was taken into custody without incident at his home Monday after he was identified through DNA from a genealogy website, the district attorney's office said at a press conference.

DNA LEADS TO ARREST IN A SECOND WASHINGTON STATE COLD CASE INVOLVED A MURDERED YOUNG GIRL

""This killer was at liberty for this brutal crime longer than Christy Mirack was on this earth alive,"" District Attorney Craig Stedman said. ""His apprehension was long overdue.""

Mirack was 25 years old when she was found strangled on Dec. 21, 1992.

A sixth-grade teacher, Mirack's principal at Rohrerstown Elementary School was concerned when she didn't show up for work and was unable to contact her.

The principal went to Mirack's home to check on her, where he found her dead on the living room floor.

YOU CAN ACTUALLY NOW HAVE TWO SETS OF DNA

Stedman said Mirack was found with her clothing pulled down from her waist, her shoes removed and the clothing on her torso was pushed up.

Mirack had blood on her face, which was ""distorted"" because she had been beaten, Stedman said. Prosecutors said there were scuff marks in her home that indicated a struggle ensued and it seemed as though she ""fought for her life.""

An autopsy determined she was strangled to death but the report noted Mirack suffered blunt trauma to her neck, back, upper chest and face. Her jaw was also fractured and she was sexually assaulted, Stedman said.

Investigators believed Mirack knew the person who killed her, as there was no sign of forced entry into her townhome in Greenfield Estates, Lancaster Online reported.

They reportedly interviewed more than 60 men, testing their blood types and bodily fluids to see if they matched Mirack's murderer.

Her alleged killer, Rowe, was identified using the genealogy website GEDmatch, and ""was not on our radar,"" Stedman said.

DNA evidence found at the crime scene was submitted to Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, which generated three composite sketches of the suspect. The company suggested they uploaded the DNA file to the genealogy website.

The upload was matched to relatives of Rowe, according to the news outlet, and he was then considered a suspect.

DNA LINK TO GOLDEN STATAE KILLER RAISES QUESTIONS OF PRIVACY VERSUS SAFETY

The DNA match wasn't enough to make an arrest, however, and on May 31, investigators reportedly collected a water bottle and gum Rowe had used and threw away at an event he was working at an elementary school.

Stedman said that while a suspect has been arrested, the case ""is by no means closed.""

Dwight Eisenhower in downtown Chicago and did what any kid might do when coming face to face with the nation's most famous soldier: She asked him to bring her dad home.

On Tuesday, the now 76-year-old Elkin will be at Arlington National Cemetery to bury the remains of Army Maj. Stephen Uurtamo, nearly seven decades after he was taken prisoner by the Chinese and died.

It is a chance to say goodbye to her father, watch as his remains are laid to rest with the dignity and honor he deserves, and watch her children and grandchildren see that their own history is linked to the history of their country.

""This tells my family they are part of something,"" said the retiree, who lives on Chicago's North Side with her husband. ""I just think that these kids might think we went from World War II to Vietnam and they don't even know there was a Korean War.""

The service comes as questions about the whereabouts of those who never returned from the 1950-53 war have pushed their way into the news, with the commitment by President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to recover the remains of as many of the nearly 7,700 U.S. troops that are still unaccounted for as possible.

US ARMY BY THE NUMBERS

For the Uurtamo family, the service is the final chapter of a story that began in late 1950 when the 32-year-old career soldier was declared missing in action after fierce fighting in one of the bloodiest battles of the war near the Ch'ongch'on River in North Korea.

He was declared dead after several returning U.S. prisoners of war reported that Uurtamo had been captured and died at a war transient camp where prisoners who survived came home with stories of watching their buddies starve to death.

""He died from malnutrition and pneumonia,"" Elkin said.

The whereabouts of his body remained a mystery for decades. Then, in 2005, a joint U.S. and North Korean military recovery team recovered 32 sets of remains from a burial site. About eight years after that, Elkin went to a Chicago hotel for one of the events the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency holds around the country in which people like her are updated about their missing loved ones and given a chance to provide DNA samples for comparison with DNA pulled from recovered remains.

The match came last September and with it, Uurtamo's name was taken off the list of Americans unaccounted for from the Korean War, which now stands at 7,697 names. He added to the list of 459 people whose remains have been identified since 1982. And, according to the POW/MIA agency, the spot where his name appears on the Courts of the Missing at the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu will be affixed with a rosette to indicate he's now accounted for.

MILITARY FIANCEE OPENS UP ON PLANNING WEDDING WITH MARINE DEPLOYED OVERSEAS

Elkin said she, her husband and more than 30 relatives will attend the burial. Inside the casket will be his remains, dress uniform and his medals, she said.

Elkin said it is a chance to be openly proud of the father, whom she rarely talked about because he died in a war few seemed to care about, and her parents were divorced and ""you didn't talk about things like that.""

Now, she said, she can talk about her father and her most lasting memory: a day when she was young and he visited her in the hospital and told her not to cry because ""little soldiers don't cry.""

She is excited by the prospect of her father being buried in ""his rightful place"" in the most famous military cemetery in the U.S.

The American Legion Sixth Memorial Post 1833 is raising $25,000 to have an American flag mural painted on the outside of its brick building in Park Slope, Brooklyn. The hall started their fundraising campaign after famed artist Scott LoBaido — known for his patriotic artwork — offered to paint the wall.

""Scott reached out to us,"" a contractor and a commander of the Sons of the American Legion at the post named Joe, told Fox News on Tuesday. Joe built the American flag bench that was constructed around the base of a tree in front of the building.

VETERANS ORGANIZATION CAN KEEP AMERICAN FLAG BENCH FOLLOWING NYC REMOVAL ORDER

LoBaido, according to Joe, asked that the building be prepped before he paints it, but volunteered to do so free of charge.

The artist is known for his patriotic tributes to America and its veterans, often painting the nation's stars and stripes on buildings throughout the U.S.

LoBaido embarked on a 50-state tour in 2015 in which he painted the same flag mural that he plans to paint at Post 1833 on American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and other buildings across the country.

When the Staten Island-based artist appeared on ""Fox & Friends"" in July 2015 and painted his signature artwork in three minutes, he said his purpose for painting American flag murals stems from ""[the heart], passion.""

""This is the greatest place on the face of the earth, and who do we owe this great gratitude for this great freedom? The men and women of the armed forces,"" LoBaido said. ""Our veterans.""

The American Legion in Park Slope is looking to raise $25,000 that will cover the cost of prepping the building, replacing air conditioning units, repairing a section of the exterior that Joe says was burned in a neighboring fire and ultimately painting the flag mural.

Michael and Khadeeja Morse said Monday that they are devastated by the accident and send condolences to the family of the victim.

Their 30-year-old son, Mikese Morse has been hospitalized several times since his early twenties.

An American track and field athlete, Mikese Morse had repeatedly qualified for the United States Olympic Trials.

But his parents told The Associated Press that over the past several years, he's struggled mentally, sometimes appearing well-functioning and other times, not taking his medication and ranting on social media.

The crash happened Sunday afternoon as 42-year-old Pedro Aguerreberry was pulling one child on his bicycle with another child following behind. The chief says all were wearing helmets and were on the off-road bike path. Aguerreberry died and his 3-year-old is seriously injured.

Dugan also says that Morse was recently hospitalized against his will for a mental evaluation. He says Morse walked into a police station on June 12 and exhibited ""odd behavior,"" so police detained him.

Max Bergen, of Chippewa Falls, Wis., said he was overwhelmed and stunned by the honor when he received the medal on Friday, the Leader-Telegram reported.

""I don't know if words can accurately describe how I feel,"" he told the Leader-Telegram. ""It took a long time for it to sink in. I didn't realize it would mean so much to me, but it does. I'm just grateful for all the work done for me.""

In 1943, Bergen joined the U.S. Army and served on the Army Air Forces bomb squadron when he was shot down over Germany in 1944.

""I was the tail gunner,"" he said. ""We had flown over Brunswick, Germany. As we came off the target, we were hit by German fighters.""

The pilot flew the aircraft lower to the ground and offered to let the passengers fly out to safety. However, no one took him up on the offer.

“We were told we were going to crash,” Bergen said. “Our pilot was so good — we slid in almost as gently as you would on a landing. I’d like to think God was flying that day.”

The plane crashed and Bergen was held prisoner at a camp in Austria for 14 months, with just a blanket and a board in his cell.

“A German soldier, he said in perfect English, ‘Come out with your hands up,’” Bergen said. “He said, ‘For you, the war is over.’”

He suffered shoulder and ankle wounds in the crash, but had no paperwork about the injuries because he was immediately taken prisoner. Such documentation is needed for the medal that honors troops injured in combat.

""I had a flesh wound in the left shoulder,"" Bergen said. ""It was like someone threw gravel in my shoulder. It was shrapnel. My right ankle was bleeding. None of my wounds were serious.""

He was freed in May 1945. He said all the passengers on the plane survived the war, but they have all passed away except for him.

Mora was reportedly babysitting the 13-year-old girl in February at her home in Kensington, where he allegedly forced the victim into having sex with him.

Mora reportedly was held for seven weeks at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility in Clarksburg after a district court judge denied his bond.

In May, his defense attorney filed a ""motion to reconsider bond,"" and on June 1, Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge Steven Salant granted Mora a personal recognizance bond, according to the station.

The personal recognizance bond would've allowed Mora to leave jail without putting up money under a deal that he'd appear at future court appearances.

The remains of Wallace Eakes, who served on the USS Oklahoma when he was 22 years old, were buried at Colorado’s Fort Logan National Cemetery after being positively identified in 2017 by the Department of Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, The Associated Press reported.

Eakes’ previously unidentified remains had reportedly been buried once before at Honolulu’s National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific.

A relative of the veteran, Gary Eakes, told the outlet that he had been shocked upon learning about his uncle’s remains. He said he ultimately chose to have them reburied in Colorado since Eakes' parents and sister, who had lived Kansas, had relocated there and are buried in a private cemetery around Denver.

""When I talked to my grandparents (Wallace Eakes' parents), they never said what to do if they found him,"" Gary Eakes said. ""I'm just kind of hoping that's what they wanted. That's the best I could do.""

Photos from the event show service members folding an American flag that was draped over Eakes’ casket. The flag was later given to Gary.

The veteran had been a Navy Storekeeper Third Class on the USS Oklahoma, according to the National Cemetery Administration’s Twitter account, which also shared a photo of Eakes' headstone.

“Eakes was killed in action while serving onboard USS Oklahoma, when it was torpedoed on Dec 7, 1941, during the attack on Pearl Harbor,” the post said.

He was among 429 sailors and Marines who died onboard the ship after it was attacked, according to The Associated Press.

514,514,2018-06-25 00:00:00,www.foxnews.com,"The lawyer who was handling former Navy sailor Kristian Saucier’s lawsuit against Obama administration officials - including the former president himself - has been barred by New York State from practicing for one year, presenting a major setback in the case.

The Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court on Thursday suspended the law license of Ronald Daigle, who came out of retirement in 2016 to help Saucier win a pardon from President Donald Trump in March.

The appellate court determined Daigle, an Iraq War veteran with the U.S. Navy and the former police chief of his town of Granville, N.Y., had taken $23,000 from the estate of a deceased person without a retainer or authorization to take the funds. Relatives and a primary beneficiary of the deceased person had hired Daigle in 2011 to handle the estate.

The suspension came just a week after Saucier and Daigle told Fox News they were preparing to sue former President Barack Obama, former FBI Director James Comey, the Justice Department and others for subjecting the former sailor to “unequal protection of the law.”

Saucier, who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he was deployed, argues the same officials who handled his case gave Hillary Clinton a pass in her use of a private email server and handling of classified information.

Saucier told Fox News Daigle's suspension blindsided both of them. He said he will proceed with his lawsuit even if he must represent himself. Saucier said he cannot afford an attorney.

Daigle did not respond to messages for comment.

But Saucier believes there is more to the suspension than meets the eye, and wonders if it’s driven by an effort to hamper his plans to sue Obama administration officials.

“Out of the blue the court decided to come after Ron for his license for a year, the window I have for my lawsuit, and they announced it after we announced my case,” Saucier said. “It’s a liberal court system … trying to dismember my legal defense. It’s a shame, it’s retribution. They’ve backed us into a corner so that I won’t be able to file the lawsuit.”

""They're trying to silence us,"" Saucier said. ""Ron doesn't deserve this. I won't be silenced. If I have to go to court and represent myself, act as my own lawyer, I will. I'm not going to be strong-armed.""

They're trying to silence us....It's a liberal court system...trying to dismember my legal defense. It's a shame, it's retribution. They backed us into a corner so that I won't be able to file the lawsuit. - Kristian Saucier

Saucier claimed that several times during hearings in state Supreme Court, Daigle was hit with comments or questions regarding his work on behalf of the former Navy sailor.

“Every time he went to court, they brought up my case,” he said. “This estate case happened years and years ago. It’s odd that this suspension is happens right now. It's upsetting. We knew we were going to have pushback. These are dirty tricks they play.""

Sean Morton, deputy clerk of the Appellate Court Division’s Third Department, declined to comment on Saucier’s allegations.

“The decision of the court speaks for itself. Attorney disciplinary proceedings, like any other judicial case, take time and can take years. It’s not unusual for something like this to happen,” he said.

Daigle, who for years has battled health problems and essentially had stopped practicing law, came out of retirement when he learned of Saucier’s case.

Daigle pursued lines of communication with Obama administration officials, who had been approached about a pardon for Saucier, and then with those working for Trump. The semi-retired attorney also took Saucier’s case to the public, doing numerous media interviews.

The decision of the court speaks for itself. Attorney disciplinary proceedings, like any other judicial case, take time and can take years. It’s not unusual for something like this to happen. - Sean Morton, deputy clerk, N.Y. Supreme Court Appellate Division’s Third Department

In the case that led to his suspension, Daigle had argued in court conferences that he believed he was right to take the money, according to published reports in local news outlets. He returned $15,000 of it, the reports said.

“Respondent later explained that he felt that he was entitled to all of the money that he had remitted to himself from the estate, but he agreed to refund the $15,000 because he ‘was trying to keep everybody happy,’” the reports said, citing the court decision.

Earlier this year, Daigle told Fox News that in the lawsuit against Obama administration officials, “We’ll highlight the differences in the way Hillary Clinton was prosecuted and how my client was prosecuted.”

“We’re seeking to cast a light on this to show that there’s a two-tier justice system and we want it to be corrected.”

While campaigning, and after taking office, Trump frequently voiced support for Saucier, who in March became the second person he pardoned.

Trump often compared the Obama administration’s handling of Saucier’s case with that of Clinton.

Saucier pleaded guilty in 2016 to taking photos inside the USS Alexandria while it was stationed in Groton, Connecticut, in 2009. He said he only wanted service mementos, but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put national security at risk by taking photos showing the submarine's propulsion system and reactor compartment and then obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera.

Saucier said that he recognized he had erred in taking the photos, which he said he wanted to show only to his family to show them where he worked. But he lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by the backlash and heightened attention about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton's emails.

As FBI director at the time, Comey said that Clinton’s use of a private email server as “extremely careless.”","NY state suspends license of lawyer for ex-sailor suing Comey, Obama",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/06/25/ny-state-suspends-license-lawyer-for-ex-sailor-suing-comey-obama.html

Severe drought has already forced officials in several western states to close national parks as precautions against wildfires and issue warnings throughout the region to prepare for the worst.

In California, officials said unusually hot weather, high winds and highly flammable vegetation turned brittle by drought helped fuel the fires that began over the weekend, the same conditions that led to the state's deadliest and most destructive fire year in 2017.

Gov. Jerry Brown on Monday declared a state of emergency in Lake County, where the biggest fire was raging about 120 miles (190 kilometers) north of San Francisco, a rural region particularly hard-hit by fires in recent years. The declaration will enable officials to receive more state resources to fight the fire and for recovery.

Jim Steele, an elected supervisor, said the county is impoverished and its fire-fighting equipment antiquated. He also said the county has just a few roads into and out of the region, which can hinder response time. Steele said the area has also been susceptible to fire for many decades because dense brush and trees in the sparsely populated area, but the severity of the latest blazes is unexpected.

""What's happened with the more warming climate is we get low humidity and higher winds and then when we get a fire that's worse than it's been in those 50 years,"" Steele said.

The fire that broke out Saturday evening has forced 3,000 residents from their homes and destroyed at least 22 buildings. It is the latest devastating blaze to rip through the isolated and impoverished county of just 65,000 people in the last few years.

In 2015, a series of fires destroyed 2,000 buildings and killed four people.

The following year, an arsonist started a fire that wiped out 300 buildings.

Last year, the county was among those ravaged by a string of fires that ripped through Northern California wine country.

""I think we're all just so traumatized and overwhelmed with all these fires year after year, this whole community is at a breaking point,"" said Terri Gonsalves, 55, who evacuated her home around midnight Sunday.

She put four goats into her truck after she looked out her back window and saw a big hill aflame. She is staying with her daughter in nearby Middletown, a small city where dozens of homes were destroyed in 2015. ""When this stuff happens, we rally around each other.""

Fire Battalion Chief Jonathan Cox said more than 230 firefighters were battling the Lake County fire in a rugged area that made it difficult to get equipment close the blaze.

A forestry scientist says it's difficult to forecast how severe California's wildfires will be this year, but said the drought-dried vegetation throughout the state is a bad omen.

""You have a lot of grass and its dry and that's cause for concern,"" said Keith Gilless, the dean of the University of California, Berkeley's department of environmental science.

Authorities on Monday afternoon lifted evacuation orders in Tehama County, where two wildfires were burning. Multiple homes and businesses in the city of Red Bluff were destroyed.

A Red Bluff police officer helping residents evacuate lost his home, authorities said. Red Bluff Police Lt. Matt Hansen said people had donated about $10,000 in cash along with furniture and clothing to the family as they search for a rental home.

Residents also fled a wildfire in Shasta County.

No cause has been determined for any of the fires.

Last year, California's costliest fires killed 44 people and tore through the state's wine country in October, causing an estimated $10 billion in damage.

While the weekend's blazes were the first major ones of the season to hit California, others have raged throughout the west for weeks. Earlier this month, a Colorado wildfire forced residents of more than 2,000 homes to evacuate. The last evacuees returned home last week.

The fire north of Durango was in the Four Corners Region where Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah meet — the epicenter of a large U.S. Southwest swath of exceptional drought, the worst category of drought.

Moderate to extreme drought conditions affect those four states plus parts of Nevada, California, Oregon, Oklahoma and Texas, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.

Dubbed ""Operation Vito,"" the 93-year-old veteran and prisoner of war was awarded a high school diploma at Becton Regional High School in East Rutherford, New Jersey, Wednesday night.

Trause stepped up to the plate on Nov. 30, 1943, when he left school (formerly known as East Rutherford High School) ""to go to war, to join the service, to fight for his country,"" Becton Regional Principal Dario Sforza told Fox News. He was supposed to graduate in 1945.

When Sforza learned Trause never received his high school diploma, he wanted to surprise the man — who he called the ""town hero"" — with one of his own.

""Instead of spending time in English class during his senior year, [Trause] was captured by the Germans as a prisoner of war,"" Sforza said, adding that the veteran worked two jobs throughout his life to support his wife and two daughters.

Moved by his story, the school principal set out on ""Operation Vito."" The mission, which he had less than a month to complete, was broken down into a few parts: get Trause his diploma and any relevant awards — like medals, sashes and stoles — all while keeping it a secret from the veteran.

Sforza worked with the state's Department of Education to give Trause not just an honorary diploma, but the real deal. He also worked with graduates from the 1950s to recreate the diploma Trause would've received in 1945.

The principal said he came across Trause's military discharge papers, which stated he received four honors for his service — the Good Conduct Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, the American Campaign Medal and the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with three Bronze Stars — and had them replicated for Trause.

Sforza also coordinated with the U.S. military to have active duty commanders and sergeants in attendance to surprise Trause.

At Wednesday's ceremony, Sforza said he took to the stage to present the gift to Trause. Usually in a wheelchair, Trause stood up and walked as he was escorted by military personnel to his daughters, who gave him his official diploma.

The 93-year-old received a standing ovation ""from every single person in the audience,"" Sforza said, adding that Trause ""couldn't stop smiling the whole time.""

""It was special. Everything fell into place,"" Sforza said. ""We had a vision, we had an operation, and we succeeded in our mission.""

""[Trause] can continue to live out all his dreams,"" the principal continued.

Graphic surveillance footage posted online – which is drawing widespread outrage Tuesday morning on social media – captures the sequence of events inside the Zesarina Grocery store in the Bronx last Wednesday before and after Lesandro Guzman-Feliz was attacked. Police have since arrested seven men in connection to the gang-related killing.

The clip begins with Guzman-Feliz entering the deli to escape the attackers, who police believe targeted him in a case of mistaken identity. A police source told the New York Post on Monday that Guzman-Feliz resembled a young man seen rapping in a video that shows a girl – believed to be the relative of a Trinitarios gang member – having sex in the background.

WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT BELOW

A post shared by 🤴🏽Robert 🌈Williams🦁 (@areumdawo_saja) on Jun 25, 2018 at 11:00pm PDT

As Guzman-Feliz jumps onto the counter, he appears to be met with resistance by a worker behind the cash register. The worker eventually lets the teen onto the other side before the two walk off camera.

Then the suspected attackers come into the store and drag Guzman-Feliz outside, where he was savagely hacked with a machete and left to die with blood gushing out of a neck wound.

Shortly after the attack, the footage shows Guzman-Feliz coming back into the store to seek assistance. As he slumps over the counter, the worker behind it appears to jump back and refuses to come to his aid.

WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT BELOW

An apparent customer who was inside the store the entire time is also seen gesturing for the teen to leave, pointing toward the door. Guzman-Feliz walks out.

Then, in one of the video’s most shocking moments, the customer reaches over a pool of Guzman-Feliz’s blood to complete a transaction that got put on hold during the attack, handing the worker what appears to be cash before getting an item back in response. The customer then throws a backpack over his shoulder and leaves the store, following Guzman-Feliz’s trail of blood out the door, while the worker is pictured making a phone call.

The teen died shortly afterward, steps away from nearby St. Barnabas Hospital.

""This just makes my blood boil,"" one Instagram user wrote next to the footage. ""The murderers came into the store and was still able to drag the boy out the bodega with nobody helping him. To [make] matters worse HE CAME BACK INTO THE BODEGA!! Bleeding… after the attack and nobody helped him!!!”

“They treated him like an animal. My heart breaks for this poor boy his family and friend,” another user reacted on Twitter.

New York City police so far have charged 19-year-old Kevin Alvarez of the Bronx with murder and gang assault in relation to the killing. Six other suspects taken into custody over the weekend in Paterson, N.J., identified as Jose Muniz, 21, Jose Tavarez, 21, Manuel Rivera, 18, Danel Fernandez, 21 Santiago Rodriguez, 24 and Joniki Martinez, 24, are awaiting an extradition hearing Tuesday afternoon, according to Fox 5 NY. All the men are suspected Trinitarios gang members.

Meanwhile, more than a thousand people reportedly turned out Monday for Guzman-Feliz’s wake.

The teen, who aspired to become a New York City police detective, was also memorialized in a tattoo on his father’s hand.

“My heart is broken, really broken,” Lissandro Guzman told the New York Post. “He’s my son, but he’s also like my best friend.”

The Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release they received a call around 3 a.m. from the home the near the intersection of FM 1464 and the Westpark Toll Road in the Houston area of Fort Bend County.

The homeowner told police that three masked black suspects broke through the front door and pistol-whipped him, causing injuries.

“This is the worst kind of crime against a family,” Sheriff Troy Nehls said. “Three crooks forcing their way into a home in the middle of the night is appalling. To make matters worse, they accosted a 7-year-old child. They’re cowards, to say the least.""

Nehls said the father kept telling the intruders there was no money and to take jewelry or a car, but the masked men weren't satisfied.

""That just didn't sit well with the suspects in this case,"" he said during a news conference Tuesday.

The men then turned their attention to the couple’s 7-year-old son, who was led around the house in search of money, according to the sheriff. Police released pictures of the three suspects in the home, including the moment one of the men tries to get the boy to locate where a large amount of money was stored.

""We have audio and video from inside that house,” Nehls said. ""You can hear chilling screams from all the family members inside that house.""

One of the masked men later placed the 7-year-old son in a bath tub with hot water in an attempt to get information about possessions in the home.

“You can hear when the bathtub was filling with water,"" Nehls said. ""Then all of a sudden the screams became muffled because he's just up underneath the water.""

Detective Justin White told reporters the boy was used as ""leverage"" by the suspects.

Nehls said the boy was transported to Texas Medical Center and was being treated for having some fluids in his lungs. He also said while the bathtub water was hot, it was not enough to cause burns to the boy.

“It just happened just like that,” he told Fox 4, adding that he heard a loud thud as his great-granddaughter was driving the car. “My eyes, I just didn’t see it.”

Previous accounts of gunfire at Malibu Creek State Park in Calabasas emerged as authorities tried to piece together clues into the murder of Tristan Beaudette, a chemist for the pharmaceutical company Allergan. Witnesses told the Los Angeles Times that shots have been reported at the site.

James Rogers, a wildlife biologist, was hiking in Tapia Park, just south of Malibu Creek State Park, in November 2016 when he was hit by birdshot. He told The Times he needed surgery to remove the pellets that had struck him in the arm that day.

“I heard a loud bang and then felt a burning sensation in my arm and fell to the ground,” he said. “Before I could look at my wound I did a quick check of the perimeter and I saw nothing.”

Rogers said he didn’t realize how serious his injury was until he got to the hospital. He said he believes he was shot at close range. He said he was shot about 200 yards from Malibu Canyon Road.

He said there had been no real progress in the shooting investigation and he’s concerned the shooter may have gotten sharper over the last couple of years.

“I was told by those working out there, there have been several other shootings,” Rogers told the paper.

Meliss Tatangelo said she was camping in her Honda in January 2017 when she heard a loud noise early in the morning.

She didn’t immediately go outside, but when she and another camper investigated, they discovered what she believed to be a shotgun round in the back of her car, according to the paper. She said she believes the round was fired from about 20 feet away.

Beaudette, of Irvine, was bleeding from a chest wound when deputies found him in a tent early Friday at the campsite. Authorities said Beaudette was shot once in the upper torso.

Investigators know about the shooting reports and have begun reviewing them but have no evidence that links the previous shootings to Beaudette’s murder, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Lt. Rodney Moore said.

“The theory we are working with is he was shot inside the tent,” Moore said. “The children were inside the tent too.”

Beaudette is remembered as a devoted father who “found true joy” in his life with his children.

“The grief and trauma this loss has caused our close-knit family is indescribable,” a family statement read.

Malibu Creek State Park was closed Monday as officials investigate the murder.

Troy George Skinner, 25, was shot after he allegedly smashed through a glass door and attempted to enter the Goochland home, Goochland County Sheriff James Agnew said.

Skinner bought duct tape and a knife after he arrived in the U.S., Agnew said. The mother saw Skinner enter her home and warned him a few times that she had a gun, then fired after he broke the glass door, according to Agnew. Officials said Skinner was struck in the neck and remains hospitalized.

“All I can say is the manner in which he attempted to enter that home in the face of a firearm pointed at him and the implements we recovered from him — the only inference is that he had very bad intent,” Agnew said.

The sheriff added that Skinner’s arrival to the U.S. was totally unexpected, according to Stuff.

Skinner will be charged with breaking and entering with a deadly weapon with intent to commit a serious crime, the sheriff said.

Nehls said the boy was transported to Texas Medical Center and was being treated for having some fluids in his lungs. He also said while the bathtub water was hot, it was not enough to cause burns to the boy.

Alix Tichelman, who was released from a Santa Cruz jail last year after pleading to involuntary manslaughter of Forrest Hayes, will be extradited from Canada to Fulton County, Georgia, Paul Howard, the Fulton County district attorney said, according to KSBW 8.

Tichelman, who is known in the media as “Call Girl Killer,” was indicted on murder charges for the 2014 heroin death of Dean Riopelle, a former boyfriend. She has denied any connection to his death, the station reported.

She recently told the station that she was clean and sober and working a normal job in Canada.

In the earlier case, Tichelman injected Hayes with heroin in November 2013 then left without seeking help when he passed out on the yacht, authorities said. Hayes had hired Tichelman several times before, and they were doing drugs and having sex the night he died, authorities said.

She has long maintained that Hayes died from an accidental overdose between two consenting adults.

Riopelle and Tichelman had been dating for about two and a half years and lived together, said Riopelle’s sister, Dee Riopelle.

An autopsy report listed his death as an accidental overdose of heroin, oxycodone and alcohol. Tichelman had told the dispatcher that he had been taking painkillers and drinking.

She told the station that she had nothing to do with Riopelle’s death.

The explosion caused bourbon to leak into public waterways. Sazerac, the parent company of Barton 1792, is facing fines from the state of Kentucky of up to $25,000 a day after it failed to notify officials about the spill, which killed over one thousand fish, according to WDRB.

Over the weekend, dead fish could be seen floating on Withrow Creek and Beech Fork in Bardstown.

""Alcohol is toxic to fish, so any fish ingesting alcohol in the water, it will kill them,"" John A. Mura, director of communications for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, told WDRB. ""Secondarily, bacteria in the water actually consume the alcohol and in so doing deplete the oxygen level in the water, and that also kills the fish because they can't breathe.""

The collapse happened Friday, when 9,000 barrels came crashing down at Barton 1792 warehouse #30 in Bardstown, located about 40 miles south of Louisville.

The cause of the collapse has not been identified, but the warehouse was built in the 1940s, which predates Nelson County's code enforcement and planning and zoning departments.

""This building was built long before any building codes were in effect,"" Nelson County building inspector Logan Spaulding told WDRB. ""That's up to the individual owner, it's their property. They have the responsibility to make sure the building is built properly.""

534,534,2018-06-25 00:00:00,www.foxnews.com,"Colored bulbs cast an eerie blue glow in the restroom of a convenience store where people who inject heroin and other drugs have been seeking the relative privacy of the stalls to shoot up.

The blue lights are meant to discourage people from using drugs in store bathrooms by making it more difficult for them to see their veins. It's an idea that's been around for years but is getting a fresh look as a result of the nation's opioid epidemic.

PENNSYLVANIA MAN FINDS HOPE AFTER YEARS OF ADDICTION AND DISPAIR

""The hardest-core opiate user still wants to be accurate. They want to make sure the needle goes in the right spot,"" said Read Hayes, a University of Florida researcher and director of the Loss Prevention Research Council, a retail industry-supported group that is looking at the lights' effectiveness. The purpose of the blue light is to ""disrupt that process"" and force people to go somewhere else to take drugs, he said.

Turkey Hill Minit Markets, a 260-store chain based in Lancaster, is one of two convenience store chains and a supermarket chain working with the loss prevention group to field-test the blue bulbs. Hayes, whose group devises methods to combat theft and violent crime at stores, said that the study is still in its infancy, but that initial feedback from stores that have been using them has been positive.

Earlier studies have questioned the lights' deterrent effect, with people who use opioids telling researchers they'd shoot up in blue light if it meant avoiding withdrawal symptoms. Many public health experts oppose the practice, saying blue lights make people more likely to hurt themselves and stigmatize those in the grips of addiction.

And, for people accustomed to injecting themselves, there are ways around the lights.

Someone in withdrawal who obtains heroin is ""going to want to use as soon as possible, even if the location is not optimal,"" said Brett Wolfson-Stofko at the National Development & Research Institutes, who has studied injection drug use in public bathrooms.

Store owners say they have to do something.

In Luzerne County, where Turkey Hill has installed blue lights at a store in Wilkes-Barre, Coroner William Lisman said people have died from overdoses in the public bathrooms of fast-food restaurants, big-box stores and other retailers.

""It can very easily go unnoticed until somebody else wants to use that restroom,"" he said. ""Other patrons realize they can't get in, the manager opens up and we find people deceased.""

At some Turkey Hill locations in hard-hit neighborhoods, store workers would often find used needles or even people slumped over from an overdose, said Matt Dorgan, the chain's asset protection manager.

""We realized we need to do something to protect our associates and our customers,"" he said.

The blue lights were part of a broader set of security measures at Turkey Hill that included brighter exterior lighting, new window signage to make store exteriors more visible from inside, and security training for store workers.

More than six months after the chain began using the blue lights in as many as 20 stores, ""we're not finding hardly anything anymore,"" Dorgan said. ""It's a pretty dramatic reduction. We haven't had a single overdose.""

Last fall, Sheetz, a convenience-store chain with more than 500 stores in six states, installed a new lighting system in the restroom of its New Kensington store, about 20 miles outside Pittsburgh. The blue lights are ""designed to help our customers and employees avoid dangerous situations,"" said company spokesman Nick Ruffner.

Sheetz, he said, has seen ""positive steps in the right direction,"" and has since installed the blue bulbs at a store in Huntington, West Virginia.

Some health experts encourage interventions that don't involve blue lights.

SHOULD PEOPLE WITH DRUG ADDICTIONS BE FORCED INTO REHAB?

Installation of needle disposal containers can help protect store employees, the public and people who use drugs, while stall doors that swing outward can make it easier to reach someone who has overdosed and is in need of medical help.

Stores can also work with law enforcement, social service agencies and addiction services to tackle the problem — a step that Hayes, at the loss prevention council, said retailers are looking to take.

Retailers aren't the only ones experimenting with blue lights.

The city of Philadelphia began distributing kits to residents that include a blue bulb for the front porch, no-trespassing signs, a tool to pick up used syringes, a needle disposal box and contact information for social services.

The city — where overdose deaths, fueled by the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl, surged more than 30 percent to 1,200 last year — has given out more than 100 kits since January.",Retailers experiment with blue lights to deter drug use,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2018/06/25/retailers-experiment-with-blue-lights-to-deter-drug-use.html

Surveys have found that about 64 percent of expecting mothers report struggling more to find the right words or focus on the tasks at hand than before they were pregnant.

But why is that the case? Is there a real biological explanation for what's been nicknamed ""pregnancy brain""? Or is the phenomenon as vague and mysterious as that phone number you could have sworn you had memorized?

MOM'S DIABETES MAY INCREASE CHILD'S AUTISM RISK, STUDY CLAIMS

Though pregnant women may notice changes in their memory, there's a host of other behavioral adaptions going on that may not be as obvious, such as increased awareness of potential threats. Indeed, pregnancy (and early postpartum) causes huge changes in a mother’s brain. ""It is the time in your life [that your brain] is most plastic during adulthood,"" said Jodi Pawluski, a research associate who studies maternal mental health at the University of Rennes 1 in France.

Raising a child and being attuned to their needs requires a parent's brain to forge new neurological connections that support these unfamiliar responsibilities, Pawluski told Live Science. Those changes stick around, too — a 2016 study published in the journal Nature used MRI scans to show that a specific pattern of gray matter, or brain cells, changes in pregnant women and that those alterations last at least two years after they give birth.

As for the specific, neurological link between pregnancy and memory, Pawluski said she hasn't seen any research investigating whether changes in the maternal brain contribute to forgetfulness.

There have been some studies, however, that have assessed the memory skills of pregnant women. In 2008, research out of Australia found that pregnant women performed just as well on memory tasks in the lab as nonpregnant women did, but the pregnant women didn't do as well on similar tasks at home. As the researchers told The Guardian that year, these results made the team think that some of a mother’s forgetfulness could be due to the drastic schedule and life adjustments pregnancy creates.

To Marci Lobel, a psychologist who focuses on pregnancy at Stony Brook University in New York, these social explanations for ""pregnancy brain"" make sense.

GIRL, 6, DIAGNOSED WITH MYSTERY NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION AFTER STRUGGLING TO WALK, TALK

""I'm always wary about pathologizing women's health experiences, and attributing weaknesses (such as 'forgetting') to pregnancy itself when in all likelihood, they're attributable to the social, financial, relationship and other strains that pregnant women may be experiencing,"" Lobel told Live Science in an email. Some women mention these and other stressors, such as adjusting to an unintended pregnancy or anxiety over single parenthood, as contributing to symptoms of depression, which affect about 25 percent of expecting mothers.

Clearly, there are many possible concerns that can crowd out a woman's brain during pregnancy, and these thoughts may make it difficult to remember certain things. And if there is a neurological explanation, it might simply be part of the way the body reallocates some resources to the development of parenting skills — shifts that are part of a normal, healthy pregnancy, Pawluski said.

What's important, she added, is that even if there's not a strong scientific explanation for why your brain feels foggier, that doesn't mean your experience isn't valid or real. ""If you think you're forgetting a lot, but I tell you you're not, that can cause a lot of anxiety,"" Pawluski said.

So, go ahead — acknowledge that you might need a little more help remembering appointments and other things while you're expecting. No one will blame you for carrying around an extra notepad.

The findings, published online in the New England Journal of Medicine, are the latest update on an experimental cancer vaccine developed at Duke Cancer Institute in Durham, North Carolina, for patients with glioblastoma, a deadly form of brain cancer.

For most patients whose glioblastoma has recurred after treatment, the average survival is 12 months. Treatment typically involves a mix of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and targeted treatments.

The experimental vaccine involves a genetically modified form of polio, which is infused into the brain tumor through a surgically implanted catheter. The vaccine works by provoking the immune system to specifically target tumor cells.

The phase 1 trial was designed to find a safe dose. It involved 61 patients treated with the poliovirus vaccine whose progress was compared to historical records of similar patients treated with standard therapy. Several patients who received a higher dose of the vaccine had brain swelling and seizures, and most had their dosage reduced.

The vaccine showed a dramatic response in some patients, with two remaining alive at least 69 months. But most did not benefit and many - 69 percent - had side effects attributable to the vaccine.

For all 61 patients, half were still alive at 12.5 months, a measure known as median overall survival, compared 11.3 months in the control group.

For patients who survived two years, the impact of the cancer vaccine became more evident.

At two years, 21 percent of vaccine-treated patients were still alive, compared with 14 percent of the historical control group. That rate remained stable at three years, with 21 percent of the vaccine patients still alive, compared with 4 percent of the control group.

""Similar to many immunotherapies, it appears that some patients don't respond for one reason or another, but if they respond, they often become long-term survivors,"" Dr. Annick Desjardins, one of the study authors, said in a statement.

The numbers are based on calls to poison control centers during that time period, according to the study, published today (June 25) in the journal Pediatrics.

Though it's used to treat opioid dependence, buprenorphine is also an opioid. However, it is much weaker than opioids that are typically abused, such as heroin and oxycodone, the study said.

FDA APPROVES MARIJUANA-BASED DRUG DRUG FOR SEIZURES

The researchers don't know how or why so many children were exposed to buprenorphine, but they think it could have resulted from parents not storing the drugs properly — that is, out of children's reach. Indeed, around 90 percent of the exposures were unintentional, according to the study.

""We're not quite sure why [buprenorphine] stands out so much [to kids],"" Henry Spiller, one of the authors of the paper and the director of the Central Ohio Poison Center, told CNN. ""Perhaps the parents who have this may not think it's as risky as their other [opioids] because it doesn't have the big effect that the other[s] do for them.""

But the drug is dangerous for young children. It ""is never prescribed for children under 6,"" Spiller said. ""It is a significant risk to them.""

RETAILERS EXPERIMENT WITH BLUE LIGHT TO DETER DRUG USE

Almost half of the children under age 6 who were exposed to the drug were admitted to the hospital, and 21 percent of them had a serious medical problem, such as a seizure, cardiac arrest, respiratory depression (slow and ineffective breathing) or coma. Seven children under age 6 died as a result of the exposure.

The researchers wrote that manufacturers should use packaging that would make it more difficult for young children to access the pills. In addition, buprenorphine prescribers should talk to parents and child caregivers about the harms of exposure for young children and walk them through how to properly store and dispose of the drugs.

The study also found that about 11 percent of the exposures were in adolescents, and that about 77 percent of those individuals took it intentionally.

“It was a complete out-of-body experience while we were waiting for EMS to arrive,” Crystal Hughes, the boy’s mother, said in a Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center news release.

Hughes, whose quick-thinking helped save her son’s life, wrapped a scarf around his injury to stop the heavy bleeding. She said she knew that it was more than a broken limb when she saw how far away the lower part of his arm was from the rest of his body.

“At the time, I didn’t even realize my decision to use the scarf as a tourniquet was so crucial – I was on auto-pilot,” Hughes said.

The teen was airlifted to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, where surgeons worked for 9.5 hours to reattach his arm.

Dr. Matthew Goldman, assistant professor of vascular surgery at the center, said the injury did not sever the major nerve supply to the arm, which allowed for the successful reconstruction of the blood supply. A team of orthopedic surgeons then worked to fix his broken bones.

While the teen has regained the ability to grip items like door handles and lightweight bags, Goldman said it could take years for the nerves to regenerate.

But when she lost the ability to speak completely, she was rushed to the hospital where doctors found three brain masses and two masses in her abdominal wall.

545,545,2018-06-25 00:00:00,www.foxnews.com,"The United Nations implored member countries Monday to fill a critical funding gap that the Trump administration created by sharply cutting the U.S. contribution to a program that helps Palestinian refugees across the Middle East.

The U.N. held a conference to raise money for basic services — from food assistance and medical care to sanitation — for 5 million refugees in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.

After the session, the United Nations was still tallying how much was pledged by which countries against this year's shortfall of $250 million facing the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees, which leads the relief efforts.

Pierre Krahenbuhl, the agency's director, said a 50 percent funding cut by the United States, the program's top donor, is endangering basic services such as food assistance in Gaza and medical clinics spread among the five areas, while about 500,000 children may not be able to start the school year.

""The situation of Palestinians is defined by great anxiety and uncertainty, first because Palestinian refugees do not see a solution to their plight on the horizon,"" he said at a briefing before the conference.

In Gaza, nearly 2 million men, women and children already are experiencing extreme shortages of water and electricity amid tensions that have worsened between the Palestinians and Israel since President Donald Trump opened a U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem.

His administration announced in January that it was withholding $65 million of a planned $125 million funding installment for the relief agency.

At the time, Trump tweeted that he saw no reason to spend so much American money in return for what he called ""no appreciation or respect"" from Palestinians.

Agency spokesman Christopher Gunness has said the actual cut was around $300 million because the U.S. had led the agency to believe it would provide $365 million in 2018. The U.S. government released $60 million so UNRWA wouldn't shut down, but made clear that U.S. donations would be contingent on major reforms.

State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said last week that the agency needs to ""determine a way to better manage its budgeting and its finances.""

The agency was created after the war that followed the birth of Israel in 1948, with about 700,000 Palestinians living there either fleeing or being forced from their homes. The UNRWA now faces its worst crisis in nearly seven decades, Krahenbuhl said.

In a report to the Security Council earlier this month, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza is compounded by the potential suspension of U.N. programs, which are ""a lifeline for Palestinians.""",UN seeks new funding pledges for Palestinian refugees,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/06/25/un-seeks-new-funding-pledges-for-palestinian-refugees.html
546,546,2018-06-25 00:00:00,www.foxnews.com,"Detectives in Jamaica are closing in on “persons of interest” in the brutal murders of a British couple — as grim details of their final moments emerged Monday.

The couple were found murdered on Friday near their eight-bedroom home in Mount Pleasant, Jamaica, just weeks after they complained of being caught up in a credit card fraud of more than $66,000.

Sources on the Caribbean island confirmed that Gayle Anderson, 71, had her hair burnt off when she was found dead 20 feet from her luxury retirement home.

The body of her husband-of-55 years Charlie, 74, was discovered more than 130 feet from the eight-bedroom house, down a slope and with burns to the genitals.

Both had face and neck wounds — with locals claiming the pair had been stabbed.

Bafflingly, the couple’s windows had been removed from the outside prior to the murders and the living room had been set alight.

A senior investigative source in Jamaica told The Sun: “We have a lot of strands to put together — some of them we just can’t explain yet.""

“Mrs. Anderson was discovered 20 feet in front of the house and on the couple’s property. She was lying on her back and her body had been partially, although not severely, burned.

“Her hair was burned off, but her face was visible. And her clothes were burned with some material sticking to her body.

“Mr. Anderson was found (more than 130 feet) from the house, but still on the couple’s land. He and his clothing were also burned — it was concentrated around the genitalia area.

“There were pieces of burnt clothing between his body and the house, like he had been on fire and was getting away from the building. He was found towards the end of a long slope. One of the rooms in the house was also burned, their living room which I believe they also used to cook in while they did construction work on another part of the home.”

Then, when she finally made it to safety, many cast doubt on her shocking story.

Now at last Chloe Ayling has the vindication she deserves, with the conviction of her abductor Lukasz Herba and a court’s public acknowledgement that she was telling the truth.

Speaking for the first time since Herba, 30, was jailed in Italy for 16 years for the kidnap, Chloe, 21, from Coulsdon, South London, told The Sun of her joy that he has been put behind bars — and that she is no longer considered a liar.

She said: “It’s a huge relief because I feel like my life has been on hold.

“It was six days of hell — and then I had to deal with all the disbelief once I got home. I feel happy now that everyone knows I was telling the truth.”

Chloe also revealed how in a bid to stay alive, she told herself she had to be willing to sleep with her kidnapper to keep him on her side.

The nightmare began in July last year, when the glamour model travelled to Milan for what she believed was a photoshoot.

Instead, at the photo studio she was injected with horse tranquillizer ketamine by a man in a ski mask, stuffed into a suitcase and smuggled to a remote Italian farmhouse.

Kidnapper Herba later claimed Chloe was an accomplice to the abduction, and had gone along with it to boost her profile.

But Chloe hit back: “The media were quoting this crazy guy in the headlines and people were reading it as the truth. They had no idea how crazy this guy is.”

Recalling the moment she was snatched, she said: “Suddenly this man has his hand on my mouth — covering my nose.

“And then another man ran in front of me with a mask on. I saw he had a syringe.

“When I woke up I was so drugged. Slowly as I regained consciousness, I realized I was in the back of a car.

Electricians are extending a power line into a flooded cave in northern Thailand to help the search and rescue efforts for 12 boys and their soccer coach stranded three nights in the sprawling caverns and cut off by rising water.

Rescuers led by elite navy divers were forced to suspend their search Monday night due to flooding but were to resume Tuesday.

The boys, aged 11-15, and their 25-year-old coach were believed to have entered the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in Chiang Rai province late Saturday afternoon. A mother reported that her son did not return from soccer practice that day, setting off the search.

The rising water frustrated efforts by the rescuers, including navy SEALs, to search farther in the cave, which is thought to be about 6-8 kilometers (4-5 miles) long and contain some large chambers. By Monday evening, officials decided to pull out temporarily.

Around midnight, Chiang Rai Gov. Narongsak Osottanakorn was with rescue teams and electricians working on extending a power line 1 kilometer (.6 miles) into the cave.

""We hope this would provide lights for work and fans for ventilation for the SEAL team,"" Narongsak said. ""Also, it means we can use electric engines to pump water out from the cave as well.""

Parents waited overnight in tents outside the cave entrance as rain continued to pour. Medics sat in a nearby tent as a few floodlights burned in the front chambers of the cave. The boys' bicycles, backpacks and soccer cleats remained at the entrance.

""We went in a few kilometers and were able to enter a second chamber behind the entrance. In that chamber, there was an area where I saw shoes and bags left behind on the ground. We believe the students have gone further in,"" said Lt. Naponwath Homsai, a SEAL team member.

Tuesday morning, relatives and others performed a ritual calling for those who are missing. They played drums and gongs and two relatives held fishing nets as symbols to fish out lost spirits from the cave. Organizer Jiratat Kodyee aid the ritual was a traditional way of showing support for the boys' families.

At a prayer session the previous evening, some relatives walked inside the cave entrance, where their cries echoed off the walls. ""My son, come on out! I am waiting for you here!"" one woman cried. Another kneeled down near the bicycles and prayed, asking ""Where is my child?""

Namhom Boonpiam, whose 13-year-old son Mongkol is among the missing, said she had been waiting at the entrance since Saturday night.

""I haven't slept and I hope that all of them can come out, all safe and sound,"" she said. ""My son is a strong boy. I still have hope.""

Authorities have said footprints and handprints were found inside the cave complex, and that tourists trapped there by past floods have been rescued after the waters receded.

Officials are hopeful there are still safe spaces in the cave complex despite the flooding, Chiang Rai Deputy Governor Passakorn Bunyalak told a news conference.

""We're confident that the kids should still be in good condition,"" he said, noting that rescuers had seen nothing inside the cave to indicate otherwise.

Getting farther into the cave has required lots of oxygen and special diving skills, which would also complicate rescue efforts once the boys are found, Passakorn said. He said divers might have to first bring in food and the boys might need to wait out the flood or learn the basics of scuba to get out.

The cave, cut into a mountainside near the border with Myanmar, can flood severely during the rainy season, which runs from June to October.

In ""The Caves of Northern Thailand,"" an online guidebook updated this year, the cave is described as explorable only from November to June due to flooding. It says the cave is an easy walk at first, but farther inside, finding a route through the rock formations and narrow passages can be difficult.

Authorities in Colombia have identified the remains of two journalists from Ecuador and their driver who were kidnapped while reporting in a dangerous border region, officials said Monday.

The Ministry of Defense announced that three bodies recently discovered had been confirmed as those of the news team that disappeared three months ago.

The employees of the Ecuadorean newspaper El Comercio were investigating a rise in drug-fueled violence along the Colombia-Ecuador border.

Families of the three men issued a joint statement expressing their grief upon learning for certain that the remains belonged to their loved ones.

""The confirmation comes with deep pain and anger over this unspeakable crime,"" the statement said. ""Now begins the road on a search for the truth.""

Officials have said an armed dissident group of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia kidnapped the trio March 26 and later killed them.

They are journalist Javier Ortega, photographer Paul Rivas and driver Efrain Segarra. The remains will be turned over to Ecuadorean officials, officials said.

Relatives said the remains would be taken to Ecuador's capital of Quito on Wednesday, where they would make funeral arrangements.

""I pledge the word of the State of Colombia and of course of the Attorney General to the families that this horrendous crime will not go unpunished,"" Attorney General Nestor Martinez said in a statement.

Ecuadorean attorney Javier Andrade, who represents the three families, said he took the Colombia's attorney general at his word in promising an open and swift investigation into the deaths.

In a proof-of-life video after their kidnapping, the three men had identified their captors as members of a dissident arm of the now disbanded Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.

However, fears that the three men had been killed surfaced in April when a Colombian TV network said it had received gruesome photos purporting to show their bodies.

Forensic officials were not able immediately to confirm the authenticity of the images, but officials later announced they had concluded the press workers had been killed.

Military operations along Colombia's border with Ecuador have led to the capture of several individuals belonging to the rebel group but the leader remains at large.

Ecuador and Colombia share a border that extends 400 miles (640 kilometers) from the Pacific to the Amazon, and armed groups of drug traffickers operate with relative freedom in the frontier zones.

A German aid ship carrying more than 200 migrants headed toward Malta after Italy agreed Tuesday to take in some of the passengers, ending Europe's second impasse this month over the people rescued off Libya's coast by private humanitarian groups.

Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte said after a phone call with the Maltese prime minister that the boat operated by Mission Lifeline would disembark in Malta and its legal standing would be investigated.

""Italy will do its part to accept a quota of migrants aboard the Lifeline, with the hope that also other European countries would do the same, as some have previously indicated,"" Conte said in a statement.

The Lifeline has been blocked in the Mediterranean Sea since last week, when both Italy and Malta refused to grant it access to their ports.

The impasse was similar to another this month over the Aquarius, a rescue ship operated by French aid groups. The ship carrying 630 migrants had its journey to land extended by a week after Malta and Italy would not grant docking rights. Spain ultimately agreed to accept the passengers, and the Aquarius traveled an additional 1,500-kilometers (900-miles) to get there.

Italy's Sky TG24, which visited the Lifeline on Monday, said it was about four times over passenger capacity and running low on fuel. According to Sky, it had on board 224 migrants, including eight children, and 10 crew members.

Italy's new hard-line interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has made clear he doesn't want rescue ships run by non-governmental agencies to ferry migrants to Italy any more. Conte is pressing is European peers to take on more of the migrant burden when they meet at a summit later this week.

In a tweet about the Lifeline, Salvini said the ""illegal ship will finally be seized"" when it arrives in Malta, adding, ""For women and children truly fleeing war, the ports are open, for all the others, no.""

Salvini has likened the ships run by private aid groups under non-Italian flags to taxi services that are serving migrant smugglers.

Italy hasn't taken the same position with other ships. It allowed the Danish-flagged container ship Alexander Maersk to dock and disembark 108 migrants in Sicily on Tuesday after days at sea.

Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat earlier pressed other EU nations to take on a share of the migrants. He also said that Malta intended to investigate the actions of the ship's captain, who ignored instructions from Italian authorities coordinating the rescue. Authorities have also questioned the legality of the ship, which has a Dutch flag but is run by a German group.

In his proposals for dealing with migration, Conte has emphasized that migrants arriving in Italy are arriving in Europe, and responsibility for them should be shared by all the member states.

""The obligation of rescue cannot become an obligation to process all the requests on behalf of everyone,"" the proposal reads, asserting that only 7 percent of migrants arriving in Europe qualify as refugees.",Rescue boat heading to Malta; Italy to take some migrants,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/06/26/rescue-boat-heading-to-malta-italy-to-take-some-migrants.html

Fighting escalated in southern Syria as government forces on Tuesday pushed deeper into rebel-held territories in Daraa province under the cover of airstrikes. The United Nations estimated that up to 50,000 people have been displaced by the weeklong offensive.

Jordan said its borders will remain closed for any new refugees, calling on the U.N. to provide security in southern Syria.

Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said aid officials were ""deeply concerned"" for those fleeing the fighting and heading toward the sealed border with Jordan. He called on warring parties to ""ensure the protection of these civilians, according to international law.""

Daraa's residents described living in extreme fear and said many had also headed to the border with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, believing it to be safer.

The escalation in Daraa, near the border with Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, came as Syria's state media reported that two Israeli missiles struck an area near the Damascus International Airport early on Tuesday, without naming a specific target.

Since last Tuesday, Syrian troops have targeted rebel-held areas in eastern Daraa, one of the country's last major rebel strongholds.

The strategic area was part of a truce deal reached last July between the United States, Russia and Jordan.

The offensive's goal appears to be regaining control of the border crossing with Jordan, which has been in rebel hands since 2015. President Bashar Assad's recent military victories, including the capture of Damascus suburbs and southern neighborhoods, have propelled the push.

Opposition activists said Syrian and Russian warplanes are taking part in the offensive. Russia's air force threw its weight behind Assad's forces in 2015, turning the tide of the war in his favor.

On Tuesday, the pro-government Central Military Media said Syrian troops gained control of al-Lujat, a rocky area in northeastern Daraa. It said the capture would have a domino effect on other parts east of Daraa and cut rebel supply lines.

Other pro-government media said the army intends to bring the entire province under its control and is likely to move on to western Daraa, where it has conducted a series of airstrikes Monday.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war-monitoring group, reported that government troops were advancing in al-Lujat and captured seven new villages in the area.

Daraa-based opposition activist Osama Hourani denied the government controlled parts of al-Lujat, saying the area, known for its caves and rocky plains, will be a challenge for Assad's troops.

Waseem Kiwan, a 36-year old civilian in the village of Tafas north of Daraa city said nothing is spared in the intensive bombing campaign, including makeshift hospitals, civil defense centers and U.N. affiliated offices.

""The area is heading toward a catastrophe, a humanitarian catastrophe in every sense of the word,"" he said. ""People are living in extreme fear.""

Kiwan said many are heading toward the border with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

""The safest place is the border with Israel because the regime and Russian airplanes cannot strike the area near the Israeli border,"" he said.

Younis Shtawi, a police officer in the Daraa village of Umm al-Mayadeen, said several villages, including Busra al-Harir, Atesh and communities in al-Lujat have been emptied of people in recent days.

""No one stayed,"" Shtawi said.

The U.S. has said the Syrian offensive risked broadening the conflict and called on Russia to end what it called violations of the truce.

Israel has also carried out a series of strikes recently on Syrian and Iranian forces in the area, warning against the expansion of Iran's role in Syria. Iranian advisers and Iran-backed militias are embedded with Syrian troops.

The U.N. World Food Program put the number of displaced from the Daraa fighting at nearly 50,000, saying it has delivered urgently-needed food across the Syria-Jordan border in the west. It said the fighting closed supply routes, causing a spike in prices of fuel and other basic supplies.

""We're sleeping in the open air, under the trees, in the mosques and schools. Those lucky to find a tent have to share it with four or five other families,"" a displaced man named Nidal told WFP.

Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi urged the U.N. to provide security in southern Syria. ""Our borders will remain closed,"" Safadi wrote on his Twitter account.

Jordan is already hosting about 660,000 registered Syrian refugees and estimates that the number of displaced Syrians in the overburdened country is twice as high.

Tuesday's attack near the Damascus airport were the latest blamed on Israel. Such strikes have increased in frequency amid soaring tensions between Israel and Iran, a major Assad ally.

State news agency SANA said the strike came shortly after midnight Monday. The Observatory said Israeli jets flew over the Golan Heights and targeted suspected weapons depots for Iranian-backed militias near the Damascus airport. There were no reports of casualties.

There was no immediate comment from Israel, which rarely responds to the claims.

SANA linked the strike to the Daraa offensive, saying it comes amid ""major losses"" for the rebels and repeating the government's claims that Israel supports ""terrorists"" operating within Syria.

Masafumi Nagasaki, 82, ventured to the island of Sotobanari, in the Yaeyama Islands near Taiwan, in 1989 and lived by himself until he made headlines in 2012 when Reuters did a profile on the “naked hermit.”

Nagasaki told Reuters in 2012 that he wished to die on the island that has been his home for so long.

“Finding a place to die is an important thing to do, and I’ve decided here is the place for me,” he said at the time.

“It hadn’t really occurred to me before how important it is to choose the place of your death, like whether it’s in a hospital or at home with family by your side,” he continued. “But to die here, surrounded by nature — you just can’t beat it, can you?”

It was not immediately clear how or why Nagasaki navigated to the deserted island.

There were reports he was married at some point in his life and had two children and that he ran a hostess club in Niigata, Japan, according to News.com.au.

Nagasaki said he was a factory worker in Osaka when a coworker told him about a “mysterious archipelago” and he wanted to leave civilization. He was also “horrified” at how much pollution was in the sea so he left and went to the island.

“In civilization people treated me like an idiot and made me feel like one. On this island I don’t feel like that,” he said.

AUSTRALIA TO BAN COVERT FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN POLITICS

“Here, on the island I don’t do what people tell me to do, I just follow nature’s rules. You can’t dominate nature so you have to obey it completely,” he explained to Reuters.

When he first arrived to the island, Nagasaki wore clothes but a strong typhoon destroyed his belongings.

“Walking around naked doesn’t really fit in with normal society, but here on the island it feels right, it’s like a uniform,” he told Reuters.

Despite his wishes to die on the island, Alvaro Cerezo, a blogger who spent five days with Nagasaki, told News.com.au that Nagasaki was evicted from the island by authorities in April and placed in government housing in Ishigaki, Japan.

“He was kicked out of the island, someone saw him on the island and it seems like he was weak,” Cerezo told News.com.au.

“They called the police and they took him back to civilization and that’s it. He couldn’t even fight back because he was weak. They won’t allow him to return.”

Nagasaki reportedly suffered from the flu.

“His health is OK, he was probably only sick or had the flu [when he was taken] but they won’t allow him to go back anymore, he cannot go there, it’s over,” Cerezo said.",‘Naked hermit’ who lived on secluded island for nearly 3 decades forced back to civilization,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/06/26/naked-hermit-who-lived-on-secluded-island-for-nearly-3-decades-forced-back-to-civilization.html

Sabrina Kouider, 35, and Ouissem Medouni, 40, were convicted last month of killing their child’s nanny, Sophie Lionnet, 21, at their south London home in September 2017. Each had denied the murder and blamed the other.

Prosecutors said the pair killed Lionnet after becoming obsessed with the belief she was conspiring with Kouider’s ex-boyfriend Mark Walton, a founding member of Irish boy band Boyzone.

Kouider was said to be fixated on Walton and believed Lionnet was having an affair with him and helping him carry out a sex-abuse plot — though the two had never met. Kouider, a fashion designer and Medouni, a banker, repeatedly beat and interrogated Lionnet in an attempt to make her confess.

Prosecutors claimed the couple starved Lionnet, beat her with an electrical cable and tortured her by dunking her head underwater. After killing her in a bathtub in September, they threw her body on a bonfire in their yard in an affluent area of southwest London near the home of the Wimbledon tennis tournament as they barbecued chicken nearby.

When neighbors called firefighters because of the pungent-smelling smoke, Medouni claimed the charred remains belonged to a sheep. Lionnet’s body was found on Sept. 20, 2017.

Walton, who is now a music producer in Los Angeles, said in court in March that his two-year relationship with Kouider was “the most turbulent relationship I had ever been in.”

He described in court how she would sometimes ""flip, get very angry, very loud and just not care where we were. She would just go crazy over something trivial.""

Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda told reporters outside the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in Chiang Rai province near the border with Malaysia the rescue efforts hinge on being able to pump out water from the cave.

Rescue efforts so far have been hampered by muddy water, according to Paojinda. Divers can only proceed when enough water has been pumped out to give breathing space. The divers will soon start using special oxygen tanks to allow more time underwater and allow them to work through all hours, according to the Associated Press.

""I want to confirm to the media that the SEAL team will be working nonstop because it's already dark here too,"" he said. ""So night and day doesn't make a big difference. They'll just need to rotate.""

Distraught relatives of the members of the soccer team, aged 11 to 16, gathered outside the cave complex and turned to prayers to bring the children home.

Relatives placed fruits, desserts, sugary drinks and sweets on mats near the cave as an offering to the spirits which some people believe protect the cave and the forest, according to Reuters.

“Come home,” cried one distraught mother, according to the news agency. “Mummy is here to pick you up.”

Rain has continued to fall in the area, which has stymied attempts to pump out water from the cave area.

Divers have been seeking a way forward through the chambers of the cave complex, but have been forced to suspend their search several times. The authorities have also been seeking alternative ways in, using helicopters and search parties on foot to find holes that might exist in the ceilings of other parts of the cave.

""We hope that the water level has gone down, but we will have to see,"" Navy Lt. Naponwath Homsai said Tuesday morning. ""Today we will try to find passages under the water that hopefully will lead to other chambers.""

The cave complex extends several miles and has wide chambers and narrow passageways with rocky outcrops and changes in elevation. Still, officials have said they are hopeful the boys found a safe space away from the floods.

Namhom Boonpiam, whose 13-year-old son Mongkol is among the missing, told the AP she had been waiting at the entrance since Saturday night.

""I haven't slept and I hope that all of them can come out, all safe and sound,"" she said. ""My son is a strong boy. I still have hope.""

Authorities have said footprints and handprints were found inside the cave complex, and that tourists trapped there by past floods have been rescued after the waters receded.

In ""The Caves of Northern Thailand,"" an online guidebook last updated this year, the cave is described as only explorable from November to June due to flooding.

It says the cave has an ""impressive entrance chamber"" that is about 260 feet long and leads to an easy walk along ""spacious passageways"" that last for about a half a mile.

As Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos prepares to step down, he says he's confident that his crowning achievement — the peace deal with leftist rebels that brought him a Nobel Peace Prize — will survive despite sharp criticism of it by the man now coming into office.

""The accord is bulletproofed,"" Santos told The Associated Press in an interview Monday at the presidential palace that in six weeks he'll hand over to incoming President Ivan Duque.

""Just the fact that Timochenko voted for the first time, as ex-commander of the FARC and now head of a political party, shows that the accord worked,"" he said, referring to the former leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, who will be among former rebels sitting in Congress next month when Santos delivers his final address to the legislature.

He also noted that the country's constitutional court has ruled it's binding on the next three governments.

Santos, 66, won international praise for signing a peace agreement with leftist rebels to end five decades of conflict that left an estimated 260,000 dead and 7 million displaced.

However he's not seen as a prophet at home, where he faces decidedly dismal approval ratings and sharp polarization over his pursuit of peace. A recent poll found just about 20 percent of Colombians approve of his performance.

Santos leaves Duque a string of challenges, among them a rise in criminal activity in areas vacated by the FARC that fueled a record boom in cocaine production last year, according to a White House report released Monday. He'll also have to contend with a political and economic crisis in neighboring Venezuela that has led more than 1 million migrants to flee their homes for Colombia, putting added stress on the country's already overburdened health and welfare services.

But by far the biggest challenge —and opportunity — is implementation of the 310-page peace accord. While some 7,000 fighters have already surrendered their weapons and are making the transition to civilian life, what Santos calls the ""ambitious"" portion of the 2016 accord — efforts to bring development to Colombia's long-neglected countryside — is just getting under way and faces a budgetary as well as security constraints.

Many Colombians believe Santos offered far too generous terms for former guerrillas behind scores of atrocities. His successor, Duque, has vowed to ""correct"" the accord, starting with rolling back the rights of former rebel commanders to occupy seats in Congress even before they confess their crimes and provide reparations to victims.

This week, on his instructions, his party blocked passage of a law essential for special peace tribunals to start hearing testimony from former combatants, prompting a standoff with Santos and putting at risk the accord's promise of justice for victims.

Santos said he's never fixated on opinion polls, saying he's following the example of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to do what's right by his country even if it's unpopular. Still, with time, he said he hoped with Colombians will remember him as someone who worked tirelessly to promote peace and modernize a country long beset by poverty, political violence and one of the world's highest rates of inequality.

""This accord wasn't made for the FARC, it was made for the local communities,"" he said. ""These are extensive areas of the country that were totally abandoned for more than 50 years and sooner or later the state had to arrive there.""

Duque worked for Santos two decades ago, first as an employee of his Good Government Foundation and then as an aide in the finance ministry whom he endorsed for a job at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington. Santos described his successor as smart and someone with sound judgment.

He's hopeful Duque's reputation for pragmatism will prevail over calls from hardliners within his Democratic Center party to tear up the accord, and said he was heartened by Duque's call on election night for unity, something that proved elusive during his presidency.

""If he manages to achieve that it will be very positive,"" he said of Duque's pledge to turn the page on years of bitter polarization. ""The country needs it.""

But if Duque does try to change the accord, he's likely to confront stiff political and legal obstacles that will leave him little room to maneuver, Santos said. They include a fragmented Congress, overwhelming international support for the deal and a ruling by the constitutional court that the accord is binding on the next three governments.

""I told the president-elect that if there are proposals that improve the accord and that can be reached by consensus then they are very welcome,"" he said. ""But what you can't do is impose changes that alter the accord's essence, among other reasons because it would require a constitutional reform.""

Once he leaves the presidency on Aug. 7, Santos said he looks forward to spending time in Bogota with his newborn granddaughter, his first. He also has an invitation to work with Amartya Sen, the 1998 Nobel laureate for economics, on issues of poverty reduction and plans to lecture internationally on his government's efforts to promote peace and protect the environment from the effects of climate change.

Even though he's vowed in retirement to stay out of Colombia's rancorous political battles, he can't resist one last piece of self-interested advice to Duque.

""If I were in the new president's shoes, I'd focus on my other campaign promises,"" Santos said. ""The country has a lot of needs, a lot of challenges. He shouldn't wear himself out on something that was already negotiated, that's working and that everyone agrees is in the country's best interests.""

Catalonia's new separatist chief plans to deliver one message to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in their highly-anticipated meeting next month: an authorized ballot over Catalan secession from Spain is the only solution to the country's worst political crisis in decades.

""We will go to the meeting with the Spanish Prime Minister ready to discuss the major issue ... which is the right to self-determination for Catalonia,"" Catalonia's regional president Quim Torra told The Associated Press in an interview on Monday. ""We won't budge from it.""

Sanchez, who like Torra has come to power in recent weeks, invited Torra to a meeting in Madrid on July 9.

It will be the first meeting between the heads of Spain's central and Catalonia's regional governments since Torra's predecessor Carles Puigdemont defied Spanish authorities and held an illegal referendum before making an ineffective declaration of independence last October. The moves won no support internationally and led to a crackdown by Spain, which took over running regional affairs until earlier this month.

Sanchez's predecessor, former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, had repeatedly rejected requests to authorize a formal Catalan referendum on independence.

Torra said that he welcomed the new Spanish government's willingness to talk, but he added: ""Until we can vote, and vote in a referendum that is legal, binding and has been recognized by both parties as valid, then it is possible that we will never find a solution.""

Polls and recent elections show that the 7.5 million residents of the wealthy region are roughly split down the middle over the question of independence. When asked about the millions of Catalans who do not want to put up a border and cease being Spanish, Torra said that ""all of us form part of the same community.""

Torra, 55, is a fervent Catalan nationalist who has had to apologize for his anti-Spanish views expressed in articles and social media posts that his critics have called xenophobic. He was hand-picked by Puigdemont in May to carry on leading the independence cause while Puigdemont fights extradition back to Spain from Germany.

Sanchez, the head of Spain's Socialists, took power at the beginning of this month by ousting Rajoy in a no-confidence vote after a major court ruling into a corruption case involving Rajoy's conservative party.

Sanchez's government has distanced itself from Rajoy's hard-line approach by proposing to amend the Spanish Constitution to create what it calls a ""federal model"" for Spain that would apparently increase the already significant degree of self-governance enjoyed by the regions. Catalonia, for example, has a large amount of control over education— which is mainly in the Catalan language— and runs its own police, hospitals and prisons.

Torra, however, said that the only reworking of the Constitution that would satisfy Catalonia's secessionists would be one that includes the right to vote on founding a new European state for the northeastern corner of the Iberian Peninsula.

""Nobody should expect (.) that we will renounce"" aspirations on independence, Torra said. ""Until we resolve the question of self-determination it is very difficult for the situation in Catalonia to change.""

Before his meeting with Sanchez, Torra will visit Washington, D.C. this week to attend an event at the Smithsonian"" Folklife Festival"", which this year will feature Catalan traditional culture.

Torra said he will use the trip to the United States to try to drum up support for the separatist cause and the release of nine high-profile Catalan separatist who are in jail while they await trial for their role in last year's failed breakaway attempt.

""We are going to make use of every chance we have (in Washington) to send this message,"" Torra said.

The separatists were jailed while Puigdemont and other collaborators fled the country to avoid summons by a Spanish judge. Those leaders who remained in Spain were imprisoned due to the flight risk they posed and the threat of them continuing to push for secession.

In another move that many hope marks a thawing of relations between Madrid and Barcelona, Torra met with Pablo Iglesias, the leader of Spain's far-left Podemos party, on Monday. Torra said he would also meet with Alberto Garzon, the leader of Spain's United Left, next week, ahead of his sit-down with Sanchez.",AP Interview: Catalan chief to ask Spain for secession vote,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/06/26/ap-interview-catalan-chief-to-ask-spain-for-secession-vote.html

The Latest on Syria developments (all times local):

6 p.m.

Syrian state media are reporting that government airstrikes are targeting southeastern parts of southern Daraa province, ahead of a new offensive there.

State TV says the offensive aims to cut supply lines between eastern Daraa and rebel-held parts of the provincial capital, which carries the same name.

The TV says the operations that began on Tuesday afternoon near the province's main grain silos that have been controlled by rebels for years.

Syrian troops have been on the offensive in Daraa for a week. The fighting has displaced nearly 50,000 people and left dozens of civilians dead.

The city of Daraa is where pro-democracy protests broke out in March 2011 that later turned into a civil war.

4:45 p.m.

Jordan's foreign minister says his country's border with Syria will remain closed, as thousands of people in southern Syria flee a government offensive.

The U.N. estimated Tuesday some 50,000 people fled their homes in the southern Deraa province over the past week, as forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad move deeper into the area. U.N. officials said many of the displaced are heading toward the border with Jordan, without an apparent escape route.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi wrote Tuesday on Twitter that ""our borders will remain closed,"" and that it's up to the United Nations to provide security in southern Syria.

Since Syria's civil war began in 2011, Jordan has taken in 660,000 registered Syrian refugees, and it says the actual number is double that.

___

2:55 p.m.

The U.N. has estimated that about 45,000 Syrians have been displaced since government troops and their allies launched an offensive in the southern part of the country a week ago.

Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said on Tuesday that those fleeing fighting in the southern Daraa province were moving closer to the sealed border with Jordan, with no apparent escape route.

A Jordanian government spokeswoman said earlier this week that the kingdom would not take in any more Syrians.

Jordan is already hosting about 660,000 registered Syrian refugees and estimates that the number of displaced Syrians in the overburdened country is twice as high.

Laerke said aid officials are ""deeply concerned"" about the safety of the displaced who he said are fleeing ground fighting and air strikes.

8:45 a.m.

Syria state media reports that two Israeli missiles have struck an area near the Damascus International Airport but didn't name a target.

State news agency SANA says the strike Tuesday happened shortly after midnight. The agency linked the reported Israeli attack to the government's ongoing offensive against rebel groups in Syria's southwestern region, which borders Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and Jordan.

SANA said the strike is part of Israel's support for the rebels amid their ""major losses"" in the south and elsewhere in Syria.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported the strikes, saying Israeli jets flew over the Golan Heights and targeted suspected weapons depots for Iranian-backed militias.

The area has come under repeated attacks, mostly believed to be by Israel. Israel rarely comments on such strikes.",The Latest: Syrian media: Airstrikes pave way for offensive,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/06/26/latest-syrian-media-airstrikes-pave-way-for-offensive.html
558,558,2018-06-25 00:00:00,www.foxnews.com,"In its ongoing effort to prevent a repeat of Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, Facebook was bound to hit some bumps in the road.

The technology giant, which recently instituted more stringent rules that force anyone running political ads on the platform to reveal their identity and location, has been called out online for mistakenly rejecting ads from businesses that were not political.

Facebook utilizes a combination of human and artificial intelligence to determine whether ads meet its standards—checking every aspect of the ad—but sometimes there are snafus.

FACEBOOK, YOUTUBE STILL STRUGGLING TO STOP TERRORIST CONTENT

The New York Times on Thursday reported that several businesses, including a hair salon and a vegetarian restaurant, had their ads rejected on political grounds. The business owners told the Times and took to social media to complain that they should not have been rejected.

Any advertisement that is deemed to be political requires another level of authorization and labeling, according to Facebook.

“Enforcement is never perfect at launch, but that's why we have processes in place for people and advertisers to help us improve. The community can find and report ads that don't have the label but should, and advertisers can appeal their ads that are in the archive but shouldn't be there,” Rob Leathern, Director of Product Management at Facebook, told Fox News.

APPLE SMACKS FACEBOOK OVER WEB TRACKING

As the social platform works to prevent another foreign entity from interfering in the upcoming U.S. midterm elections, it seems likely that the newer, broader approach to screening may end up catching some innocuous ads in the push to be more careful.

“This also underscores why we launched these tools: to bring more ads transparency to the platform and encourage people to ask questions,” Leathern said.","Facebook rejects ads from restaurants, hair salons, because they're too 'political', report says",http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2018/06/25/facebook-rejects-ads-from-restaurants-hair-salons-because-theyre-too-political-report-says.html
559,559,2018-06-25 00:00:00,www.foxnews.com,"Navy weapons developers are seeking a high-tech, longer range and more lethal submarine-launched heavyweight Mk 48 that can better destroy enemy ships, submarines and small boats, service officials said.

The service has issued a new solicitation to industry, asking for proposals and information related to pursuing new and upgraded Mk 48 torpedo control systems, guidance, sonar and navigational technology.

“The Mk 48 ADCAP (advanced capability) torpedo is a heavyweight acoustic-homing torpedo with sophisticated sonar, all-digital guidance and control systems, digital fusing systems and propulsion improvements,” William Couch, Naval Sea Systems Command spokesman, told Warrior Maven.

Naturally, having a functional and more high-tech lethal torpedo affords the Navy an opportunity to hit enemies more effectively and at further standoff ranges and therefore better compete with more fully emerging undersea rivals such as Russia and China.

The Mk 48 heavyweight torpedo is used by all classes of U.S. Navy submarines as their anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface warfare weapon, including the Virginia class and the future Columbia class, Couch added.

A Mk 48 torpedo is 21 inches in diameter and weighs 3,520 pounds; it can destroy targets at ranges out to five miles and travels at speeds greater than 28 knots. The weapon can operate at depths greater than 1,200 feet and fires a 650-pound high-explosive warhead, available Navy and Lockheed data states.

Navy efforts to pursue new torpedo technologies are happening alongside a concurrent effort to upgrade the existing arsenal.

For several years now, the Navy has been strengthening its developmental emphasis upon the Mk 48 as a way to address its aging arsenal. The service restarted production of the Mk 48 torpedo mod 7 in 2016.

An earlier version, the Mk 48 Mod 6, has been operational since 1997 – and the more recent Mod 7 has been in service since 2006.

Lockheed Martin has been working on upgrades to the Mk 48 torpedo Mod 6 and Mod 7 – which consist of adjustments to the guidance control box, broadband sonar acoustic receiver and amplifier components.

“The latest version of the Mk 48 ADCAP (advanced capability) is the mod 7 Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System. The Mk 48 ADCAP mod 7 CBASS torpedo is the result of a Joint Development Program with the Royal Australian Navy and achieved initial operational capability in 2006,” Couch said.

With Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System, or CBASS – electronics to go into the nose of the weapon as part of the guidance section, Lockheed and Navy developers explained.

CBASS technology provides streamlined targeting, quieter propulsion technologies and an ability to operate with improved effectiveness in both shallow and deep water. Also, the Mod 7 decreases vulnerability to enemy countermeasures and allows the torpedo to transmit and receive over a wider frequency band, Lockheed and Navy developers say.

The new technology also involves adjustments to the electronic circuitry in order to make the acoustic signals that are received from the system that allow the torpedo to better operate in its undersea environment.

Modifications to the weapon have improved the acoustic receiver, replaced the guidance-and-control hardware with updated technology, increased memory, and improved processor throughput to handle the expanded software demands required to improve torpedo performance against evolving threats, according to Navy data on the weapon.

Improved propulsion, quieting technology, targeting systems and range enhancements naturally bring a substantial tactical advantage to Navy undersea combat operations. Attack submarines are often able to operate closer to enemy targets and coastline undetected, reaching areas typically inaccessible to deeper draft surface ships. Such an improvement would also, quite possibly, enable attack submarines to better support littoral surface platforms such as the flat-bottomed Littoral Combat Ships. Working in tandem with LCS anti-submarine and surface warfare systems, attack submarines with a more capable torpedo could better identify and attack enemy targets near coastal areas and shallow water enemy locations.

A Military Analysis Network report from the Federation of American Scientists further specifies that the torpedo uses a conventional, high-explosive warhead.

“The MK 48 is propelled by a piston engine with twin, contra-rotating propellers in a pump jet or shrouded configuration. The engine uses a liquid monopropellant fuel,” the FAS analysis states.

Submarine operators are able to initially guide the torpedo toward its target as it leaves the launch tube, using a thin wire designed to establish and electronic link between the submarine and torpedo, the information says.

“This helps the torpedo avoid decoys and jamming devices that might be deployed by the target. The wire is severed and the torpedo's high-powered active/passive sonar guides the torpedo during the final attack,” FAS writes.

Earlier this year, Lockheed Martin Sippican was awarded a new deal to work on guidance and control technology on front end of the torpedo, and SAIC was awarded the contract for the afterbody and propulsion section, Couch explained.

The Mk 48, which is a heavy weapon launched under the surface, is quite different than surface launched, lightweight Mk 54 torpedoes fired from helicopters, aircraft and surface ships.

The Navy’s Mk 48 torpedo is also in service with Australia, Canada, Brazil and The Netherlands.

560,560,2018-06-25 00:00:00,www.foxnews.com,"The Air Force plans to fly its war-tested 1950s-era C-130 aircraft well into the 2030s and beyond through a sweeping, multi-pronged technical overhaul, designed to enable the propeller-flown aircraft to perform its high-risk troop transport and combat support missions for decades to come.

While there have been many innovations, upgrades and technological enhancements to the aircraft since it originally surfaced in the mid-1950s, the historic cargo plane may wind up flying for more than 80 years, according to current Air Force plans.

The service is giving the platform new propeller technology, radios, glass cockpit touchscreen displays, digital avionics, collision avoidance technology and reinforced ""wing-boxes,"" service officials said.

The airframes themselves are a key focal point of the effort, Air Force developers explain, which includes replacing and reinforcing the “center wingbox” of the aircraft where the wings mount to the fuselage.

“The C-130 center wing box replacement program replaces time-limited center wing boxes on applicable variants of the C-130s. Center wing box installations are underway at Warner Robins Air Logistics Center for legacy C-130s and C-130Js as flight hours require,” Maj. Emily Grabowski, Air Force spokeswoman, told Warrior Maven.

As for when a C-130 needs maintenance upgrade to preserve and maintain service life, the Air Force uses an assessment metric referred to as “equivalent baseline hours.” The wing-boxes are changed once the aircraft reaches a certain “severity factor” in its operational service time.

This is necessary because the wear and tear or impact of missions upon and airplane can vary greatly depending upon a range of factors such as the altitude at which a plane is flying, Air Force weapons developers said.

“Low-level flight may be three to four times the severity factor of flying at a higher level,” one senior Air Force official told Warrior.

Called an Avionics Modernization Program by Air Force developers, the upgrades also include adding new 8.33 radios to the aircraft to improve communication and initiatives to upgrade cockpit voice recorders and digital data recorders. C-130s will also receive new collision-avoidance technology designed to prevent the planes from hitting terrain or colliding with one another mid-air

As a propeller-driven aircraft, the C-130s are able to fly at low altitudes, land in more rugged conditions and withstand harsh weather such as obscurants. The propellers make the aircraft’s engines less susceptible to debris flying in and causing operational problems for the engines.

An Air Force C-17, by contrast, needs to operate in more defined conditions, such as areas with longer, separated or unobstructed runways. Flying debris or uneven terrain could of course present complications for C-17 engines, whereas the C-130 is specifically designed for low-altitude, high risk combat zones with uneven terrain – scenarios requiring both durability and maneuverability. In fact, in so-called “hot” or active combat zones, C-130s often airdrop weapons, supplies and even troops when called upon by Commanders.

These factors inform a large part of the calculus for the ongoing Air Force effort to replace the C-130s existing hydromechanical propeller control system with a new Electronic Propeller Control System (EPCS).

​Electronic Propeller Control System modification is underway for all C‑130Hs, Grabowski said.

“The T-56 3.5 engine, 8-bladed propeller, and EPCS are undergoing operational test and evaluation at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. These modifications were tested individually and are now undergoing test together to determine their combined operational effectiveness,” she added.

An essay written by the National Guard Association of the United States further elaborates upon the merits of moving to electronic propeller control systems.

“EPCS improves safety by accelerating response time when throttles are rapidly advanced; an issue in previous mishaps. The legacy propeller control system uses 1950’s technology and is a significant maintenance cost driver,” a 2015 National Guard Association “C-130 Propulsion Upgrade” paper for Congress states.

Acceleration improvements such as this naturally bring tactical advantages as well; more maneuverable aircraft better able to handle and accelerate are less vulnerable to enemy ground missile attacks.

“EPCS kits replace 54H60 propeller mechanical controls with a system based on digital computer software, offering improved reliability, and more precise performance. EPCS represents a 50-year leap in prop control technology for C-130 operators with the 54H60 propellers,” a statement from EPCS-maker Hamilton Sundstrand states.

The original 1999 US Patent Application for Electronic Propeller Control Systems, submitted through United Technologies by a small group of inventors, explains that the new electrical system improves the mechanisms controlling the “pitch angle” of a propeller blade. This improves maneuverability, creates faster acceleration from the throttle and optimizes the connectivity between the propeller controls and the movements of the propeller blades. A stable pitch angle, described as the angle between the horizontal and vertical axes of the aircraft, is essential to aircraft performance and flight stability.

“The apparatus converts mechanical inputs of the propeller and airframe systems to electronic signals, which can be measured by the electronic control. The apparatus also receives and converts the electronic control's commands into hydraulic pressure and flow changes through an electro-hydraulic servo valve,” the Patent Abstract writes.

561,561,2018-06-26 00:00:00,www.foxnews.com,"American restaurants are employing robots to make up for a shortage of fast-food workers.

Businesses around the world are increasingly turning to droids to reduce running costs – and fast-food joints are at the forefront of the robot revolution.

Earlier this year, we saw Flippy the burger-flipping robot take up residence in a Californian burger restaurant.

And now US burger chain Wendy's has begun installing self-cleaning ovens in some stores, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Meaty restaurant chain Arby's also uses smart ovens, which can cook roast beef and then switch to a ""holding"" mode.

This means employees can cook food for the next day the night before, rather than arrive at 7am to starting roasting.

It's an unsurprising response to a severe shortage of fast-food workers across the pond.

""I've never seen the labor market this tight,"" said Scotty Murphy, COO for Dunkin' Donuts, speaking to the WSJ.

""We spend a lot of time training people and a month later they walk out the door.""

The US hospitality industry had 844,000 unfilled positions in April this year – a record high.

The industry accounts for roughly one out of every eight jobs available in America.

Dunkin' Donuts has already automated some processes – like producing expiration labels for food, and measuring the quality of coffee.

""I don't have to be constantly worried about other smaller tasks that were tedious,"" said Alexandra Guajardo, the morning shift leader at a Dunkin' Donuts store in California:

""I can focus on other things that need my attention in the restaurant.""

According to a 2013 study by the University of Oxford, food service jobs ranked among the top 20% most automatable – from 700 occupations surveyed.

And research by the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development said food preparation faced the highest probability of automation among 88 industries.

""In this market, employees will leave if they have one bad day,"" Patrick Sugrue, chief exec of Saladworks, told the WSJ.

""If that happens, having this technology in place makes it easier to deal with.

""Having wait times go up due to short staffing is a quick way to kill a brand.""

Earlier this year, Flippy the burger-flipping robot started working at CaliBurger in Pasadena, California.

The food prep bot can flip burger patties, and then remove them from the grill when they're ready.

Flippy doesn't look much like a fast-food worker though – he's actually just a giant mechanical arm with joints.

The bot is powered by an AI brain that uses computer vision to identify and monitor burgers.

It can tell the difference between an uncooked patty, a cooked burger, and even a cheese burger.

Flippy also knows what a bun looks like, and can identify the top and bottom buns – as well as the inside and outside of the bun.

Better still, Flippy knows the switch between spatulas when moving between raw meat and cooked meat.

And he can even clean the utensils while cooking, and wipe the surface of the grill with a scraper.

Cook outlined his views on when CEOs should protest government policies during a Monday evening appearance at a business conference hosted by Fortune magazine.. His remarks came a week after he condemned the Trump administration's since-reversed practice of separating children from parents accused of crossing the U.S. border illegally in an interview with The Irish Times.

If he had dodged the politically charged subject, Cook said he would have been cast into ""the appalling silence of the good people category and this is something that I never want to be a part of.""

Cooks listed education, privacy rights, the environment and human rights as other key issues for him and Apple.

In a joint statement emailed to PCMag Tuesday, the city and Police Department said its pilot program to trial the technology ended last week.

""Staff continues to discuss and evaluate whether to recommend continuation of the pilot at a further date,"" the statement reads. ""At this time that process is still ongoing and the contract with Amazon remains expired.""

Orlando police had been using the technology to match faces captured by street surveillance cameras to photos uploaded in a database to keep tabs on high-profile individuals, like the mayor, or identify persons of interests.

""Orlando is always looking for new solutions to further our ability to keep our residents and visitors safe,"" the city and Police Department's statement continued. ""Partnering with innovative companies to test new technology - while also ensuring we uphold privacy laws and in no way violate the rights of others – is critical to us as we work to further keep our community safe.""

The technology has drawn fierce scrutiny of privacy advocates who worry it could be used to track people without their knowledge or consent.

In a Monday letter to Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida demanded the city abandon the technology.

""Face surveillance systems like Rekognition present a grave threat to Orlando residents and visitors,"" the letter reads. ""These systems enable the mass location tracking of residents without criminal suspicion. Amazon's product is primed for such abuse.""

The letter notes that the Orlando Police Department deployed the technology ""in public places without inviting a public debate, obtaining local legislative authorization, or adopting rules to prevent harm to Orlando community members.""

Amazon did not immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment.

Meanwhile, a group of Amazon's own employees last week pressured the company to stop offering its technology to police and US immigration authorities over fears of potential misuse.

""We refuse to build the platform that powers ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement), and we refuse to contribute to tools that violate human rights,"" reads an internal company letter from the employees, as first reported by The Hill.

In a blog post earlier this month, Amazon said the technology – which, according to The New York Times is still in use in Washington County, Ore. – has been helping to stop crimes such as human trafficking and child exploitation. ""There have always been and will always be risks with new technology capabilities,"" Amazon said. ""But we believe it is the wrong approach to impose a ban on promising new technologies because they might be used by bad actors for nefarious purposes in the future.""

“You want a tariff-free, you want no barriers, and you want no subsidies, because you have some cases where countries are subsidizing industries, and that’s not fair,” he said at the Group of 7 meeting in Quebec. “So you go tariff-free, you go barrier-free, you go subsidy-free. That’s the way you learned at the Wharton School of finance. I mean, that would be the ultimate thing.”

But he also lamented that the United States is “a piggy bank everybody is robbing,” spurned the G-7’s joint communiqué that rejected protectionism, and is imposing tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese exports, all signs that he’s actually moving in the opposite direction.

But let’s take his statement at face value.

“If Trump is serious about zero tariffs, then let’s make it part of the agenda,” said Edwin J.

She has cancer and has been on a ventilator, according to officials with Mr. Sharif’s political party, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz. His request that the verdict be delayed for at least one week was rejected by the judge earlier on Friday.

Members of the Sharif family had said before the verdict that they would appeal any convictions, but they are unlikely to get relief from the higher courts.

The conviction also bars Maryam Sharif from contesting the July 25 elections, in a blow to Mr. Sharif’s ambitions for his daughter to play a leading role in national and party politics. Ms. Sharif has emerged in recent months as a powerful voice for civilian rule and against the military’s interference in politics.

Mr. Safdar, the son-in-law, is in Pakistan but was not in court when the verdict was announced. He is campaigning in his hometown of Mansehra in the country’s northwestern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province and was expected to hold a news conference later on Friday.

Mr. Sharif and his daughter have said that they are not afraid to go to jail, but it remains to be seen whether they will return to Pakistan before the elections. Political opponents have already said that the Sharif family is in an unannounced exile.

Their absence is bound to further worsen the fortunes of their party, known by the abbreviation PML-N.

Several other senior figures in the party have also been barred by courts from running in the July 25 elections.

How safe will your building be in an earthquake? A bill in the California Legislature, AB 2681, would require cities to create inventories of potentially vulnerable buildings. It has passed through seven committees and is now in the Senate Appropriations Committee, where it faces uncertain passage for budget reasons. The bill would create extra work — and costs — for local municipal building departments.

Assemblymen Adrin Nazarian, who introduced the bill, says the cost of identifying weak buildings is worth it.

“When the ground starts shaking, you can either pray your building is safe or know your building is seismically safe,” Mr. Nazarian said by email.

Often the public is not informed that a building is not to code until after a problem has been fixed.

Last week, sunbathers lounged on a pool deck high above the bay here, on a block that was devastated by the storm. They were some of the first residents of 1 Brooklyn Bay, the recently completed 30-story condo and rental tower that is the tallest building in this part of Brooklyn.

“This was built specifically with Sandy in mind,” said Jason Muss, one of the developers, on a tour of the new luxury tower, where units range from $995,000 for a two-bedroom to $3.71 million for a four-bedroom penthouse — prices that rival more expensive Brooklyn neighborhoods, testing the limits for the area.

Thursday afternoon, Mr. Pruitt delivered President Trump his resignation letter, replete with references to “God’s providence” and how “blessed” he was to have had the opportunity to serve not the nation, but this president. He sadly noted that “the unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on all of us.” And so Mr. Pruitt heads for the door, leaving behind a dark, oily stain on the office that he has spent the past year and a half vigorously defiling.

Mr. Pruitt’s departure did not come as a total shock. Word around Washington in recent weeks was that the stench of corruption wafting from E.P.A. headquarters was getting to be too much even for Mr. Trump. Someone in the White House no doubt noticed that, with the midterms approaching, Mr. Pruitt was not playing well with any voter who retains some common sense. In an administration characterized by extreme swampiness and ethical flexibility, the E.P.A. chief had nonetheless distinguished himself with pathological grifting to the point that even some Republican lawmakers and reliably conservative commentators had begun publicly slapping him.

Still, for months, Mr. Pruitt held on to his job as the embarrassing revelations piled up like so many used mattresses: his profligate spending on posh travel, over-the-top security, and ridiculous, self-aggrandizing office supplies; his directing agency staffers to run his personal errands, including finding him a place to live in Washington and combing hotels for his favorite skin cream; his attempts to score his wife a high-paying job, possibly involving chicken nuggets and waffle fries. Every week seemed to bring fresh examples of Mr. Pruitt’s shameless and yet surprisingly petty misuse of his office.

Mr. Trump’s willingness to tolerate Mr. Pruitt’s chicanery was not surprising. The two men share an environmental philosophy that may be roughly summarized as “industry over science,” and, for all his flaws, Mr. Pruitt was tireless in the crusade to dismantle environmental protections. His greatest hits include playing a key role in getting Mr. Trump to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement; pushing the repeal of numerous Obama-era regulations, including those to cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and automobiles; and instituting a policy that barred scientists who receive federal grants from serving on the E.P.A.’s advisory committees, while simultaneously welcoming corporate representatives onto these panels.

Sometimes themeless Saturdays are just hard, and therein lies the satisfaction of finishing, but there is a slight derangement to some of Andy Kravis’s arrangements that I quite adored.

This is Mr. Kravis’s Saturday debut in the Times, at least; he’s co- and solo-constructed eight others for us, but he’s one of those energetic types that constructs all over the place and keeps a blog with additional puzzles, so if your interest is piqued here, you can solve some more of his stuff.

Thursday puzzles are known for their tricky themes and clues, and this was another example of the kind of clue that requires solvers to think outside the grid.

The answer was the U.S.O., which stands for United Service Organizations. The “for short” is an indicator that solvers need to think of an abbreviation or initialism, and “What gets the show on the road” is a punny hat tip to the entertainment and support that the U.S.O. has provided to U.S. troops since World War II.

Before the war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt united several service organizations (including the Salvation Army, the Young Men’s Christian Association, the Young Women’s Christian Association, the National Catholic Community Services, the National Travelers Aid Association and the National Jewish Welfare Board) under one umbrella organization, which became the U.S.O. Today, as the United States armed forces perform their duties around the world, the credo of the U.S.O. is to “always be by their side.” These services include but are not limited to keeping military families connected, providing services as the troops travel and bringing entertainment to them as a morale booster.

U.S.O. has appeared in The New York Times Crossword a total of 210 times.

And on those particularly engaging days when readers flood the messenger with questions and comments, “Our faces go into that contortion that’s a combination of a smile and a frown,” said Jason Stallman, editor of the Sports desk. “We’re thrilled that so many readers are responding, but we’re frustrated because we realize we won’t be able to respond to all of them. So we do the best we can.”

Still, overwhelming reader response can often shape coverage. Sarah Lyall, a reporter who led a messenger conversation about swarms of insects on the field in Volgograd, Russia, got such an influx of questions and comments from readers that she turned the topic into a stand-alone story.

The World Cup messenger evolved from similar straight-to-reader efforts from the Sports desk. The team sent text messages to readers during the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. And during this year’s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the Sports desk also used a messaging app, though it was limited to one reporter, Sam Manchester. The new messenger, by contrast, connects users to many of the more than a dozen journalists on the ground.

The result is a great gathering of perspectives not unlike the World Cup itself. Over time Mr. Das has cultivated a rapport with messengers — or at least, “no one’s called me an expletive yet,” he said. There are even “regulars,” who hail from around the planet.

But Mr. Das’s favorite message so far came on the second Sunday in June: “Hi Dad. Happy Father’s Day” — from his son, reaching out from Connecticut.

The E.P.A. spokesman and the agency’s general counsel declined to comment.

Ms. Morris had nearly a decade of experience in Washington and solid Republican credentials, according to her résumé. She worked for former Representative Denny Rehberg, a Montana Republican, as an assistant and scheduler, before working as a federal affairs specialist for Koch Companies Public Sector, the lobbying arm of Koch Industries, the conglomerate long run by the conservative brothers David H. and Charles Koch.

Ms. Morris, whose start date at the E.P.A. was June 18, was an executive scheduler with an annual salary of $90,350. She handled a variety of planning needs for Mr. Pruitt, including requests for meetings with executives from Toyota and Chevron.

The account of the calendar deletions and the aftermath is based on interviews with four people who were working at the agency at the time, including Mr. Chmielewski and three others who asked not to be identified out of concern for retaliation.

Last week, I reached out to Twitter’s employees to ask just that. Insiders were reluctant to talk on the record, but a few said that even if there’s little public evidence of organized resistance, some employees are constantly debating the role the service plays in public discourse. Mr. Trump’s tweets, in particular, arouse internal conflict, they said. And Mr. Dorsey’s decision — earlier reported by The Washington Post — to meet with conservative pundits who have accused the platform of liberal bias did not sit well with many workers.

Twitter declined to make Mr. Dorsey available for an interview. The company did put me on the phone with Vijaya Gadde, its head of legal, policy, trust and safety, who echoed the idea that there is robust debate within Twitter about its impact on the world.

“A lot of our employees are here because they’re tied to the mission that we’re serving and to our purpose in the world,” Ms. Gadde said. She defined that mission as providing “a healthy public conversation,” but acknowledged the company has had trouble defining exactly what such a healthy conversation might look like.

“We do have our own internal metrics, but some of that can be really noisy,” she said. For instance, the company looks at reports from users flagging abuse, or the rates at which people block, mute or follow others. “But we just don’t know if they’re all correct,” she said, which is why the company recently put out a call to academics and other experts to suggest new metrics for measuring the “health” of discourse on Twitter. That work, Ms. Gadde said, could soon lead to a better Twitter.

To critics, Twitter’s call for outside help in deciding the most straightforward element of its platform feels like part of a familiar pattern at the company — slow-walking a response to problems that have long been obvious to users, and that grow more obvious by the day.",Employee Uprisings Sweep Many Tech Companies.

In your mind’s eye, you know that there’s color and all, but you don’t need to see color. These images capture something else, a mood.”

Over the years, Mr. Henderson’s photography has grown broad in gesture, humming with sublime symbolism: a woman with her hands on her hips who stands watching over her brood on a porch in midcentury Virginia is a vivid image of a mother’s love; a black ballerina in repose before a traditional frieze is a contrast in beauty, then and now; and a picture of Muhammad Ali at a news conference surrounded by the Jackson 5’s star presence, is an outsize sign of black power. Exposing the contractions of wealth is a somber 1968 scene of a lone civil rights protester sitting outside a sea of tents at “Resurrection City,” the encampment the Poor People’s Campaign set up in the shadow of the Washington Monument to shame a nation.

Mr. Henderson sees these photos as “a part of the American landscape,” that make a statement linking past and present. “It’s just capturing the things you see in the street that could be very easily overlooked by most people,” he said. “Most of us, we’re not looking for photographs as we walk around.

The American trade embargo of Vietnam continued, the fate of missing American servicemen remained an emotionally charged question, and the United States was still demanding that Vietnam withdraw its troops from Cambodia.

Mr. Crawford had protested the war in the late 1960s as a college student. But he said a “photographer’s curiosity,” rather than ideology, was what compelled him to join the group of Americans traveling to Vietnam for three weeks. It was part of an unofficial effort to jump-start friendlier relations.

“I wasn’t interested in hearing about the ‘lessons of Vietnam,’ which always struck me as dangerously oversimplified, at best,” Mr. Crawford, now 69, wrote in “Hanoi Streets 1985-2015,” which Images Publishing will publish in June.",Documenting Hanoi’s Postwar Evolution,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/lens/william-crawford-hanoi-vietnam.html
586,586,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"A.P.: My work in philosophy does not presume to tell anyone what to do. It addresses the foundations of ethics — metaethics — rather than normative ethics. So it does not prescribe any particular strategies for action to anyone. These can be meaningfully formulated only by those who are directly involved in and therefore maximally well informed about the circumstances under which action is required.

However, perhaps my work can offer a way of understanding what is at stake in the Black Lives Matter movement that may be of use. The basic argument of “Rationality and the Structure of the Self” is organized around the distinction between egocentric and transpersonal rationality. Transpersonal rationality consists in hard-wired cognitive dispositions that define us as human beings: to consistency, coherence, impartiality, impersonality, intellectual discrimination, foresight, deliberation, self-reflection and self-control. Egocentric rationality consists in placing these dispositions in the service of satisfying our personal desires and advancing our self-interest.

It is easy to conceive the Black Lives Matter movement as merely advancing the self-interest of African-Americans in surviving and flourishing within a society whose self-interest is systemically opposed to this. This reduces the impetus for protest to a conflict of interests between those who join or support this movement and those who resist it — as though all that were at stake were whether or not police are justified in being so terrified of an African-American teenager that shooting him in the back is a defensible preventive measure. To conceive the issue merely in these terms turns it into a contest as to whose interests are to prevail — those who see trigger-happy police as protecting their interests or those who see them as sabotaging theirs. This view of the situation lends itself to the conclusion that the United States is still fighting the same race war it was in 1860.

There is a lot of truth to this view. But it ignores the fact that the Black Lives Matter movement is not fighting merely to protect and advance the interests of African-Americans. It is fighting to cultivate a fundamental level of humanity in all Americans. The transpersonally rational dispositions I’ve listed constitute the ancient foundation of the historically recent idea of a universal human right that extends basic freedoms, responsibilities, rights and resources to every human being, regardless of their interests — not merely to those whom the police are personally inclined to protect. That African-Americans have survived and flourished for 400 years by resisting an environment devoted to dehumanizing them demonstrates quite conclusively how highly their capacities for transpersonal rationality are developed. The statement that black lives matter is a reminder to those whose perpetuation of that environment has effectively dehumanized them to develop those capacities just as highly; i.e. that their own humanity also matters.

L.O.B.: Do you have an ideal reader for these books?

A.P.: To really read any discursive text, whether a philosophical tract or a legal contract, is a disturbing and cognitively disorienting experience, because it means allowing another person’s thoughts to intrude into your own and rearrange your beliefs and assumptions — often not in ways to which you would consent if warned in advance. Even when you deliberately decide to learn something new by reading, you put yourself, your thoughts and your most cherished suppositions in the hands of the author and trust her or him not to reorganize your mind so thoroughly that you no longer recognize where or who you are. It’s very scary; hard, painstaking work of determined concentration under the best of circumstances. So particularly with philosophical texts, the whole point of which is to reorganize your thinking, people often don’t really read them at all; they merely take a mental snapshot of the passage that enables them to form a Gestalt impression of its content, without scrutinizing it too closely.

This “snapshot” approach to reading protects the reader against the potentially disruptive mental effects of the text, while enabling enough of it to filter through to ensure at least a minimal comprehension of its content. But it also enables misunderstanding and misrepresentation of what the text actually says that can be so profound as to invalidate the gesture of reading it in the first place. In the last 40 years, a highly regarded tradition in one part of the field of Kant scholarship has developed that is predicated on deliberately disregarding what Kant actually says. My worst nightmare for “Rationality and the Structure of the Self” is a reader who approaches the text with this “snapshot” habit of reading. I worked hard to make the prose style of this work as clear and accessible as possible, given the complexity of the argument. All I ask of an ideal reader is that they take the time to really read it.

L.O.B.: You’ve said that an epistemic skepticism drives your work. Could you elaborate?

A.P.: As an attitude rather than a philosophical position, epistemic skepticism consists in always second-guessing your own judgments — about yourself, other people and situations; always monitoring those judgments to make sure you’re seeing clearly, have the facts right, aren’t making any unfounded inferences or deceiving yourself, etc. Women are particularly skilled at this because their judgment, credibility and authority start to come under attack during puberty, as part of the process of gender socialization. They are made to feel uncertain about themselves, their place in society and their right to their own opinions. If that socialization doesn’t work, they can’t be made to obey, to defer and to depend on others to make important decisions for them. Obviously this is a horrible, misogynistic practice, now known as “gaslighting” after the 1944 George Cukor film. But the benefit is precisely this self-critical attitude — of careful review of and reflection on the adequacy of one’s own thought processes.",Opinion | Adrian Piper Speaks!

587,587,2018-07-04,www.nytimes.com,"Captain America enjoys a rarefied position in the superhero pantheon. Since his 1940 debut (in which he punches Adolf Hitler in the face), Captain America has been defined as the quintessential patriot. In stories that have riffed on divisive political moments — Watergate, the War on Terror — the Captain, also known as Steve Rogers, has emerged as a complex man, one willing to question the direction his country takes.

Marvel announced in February that the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates would assume writing duties on a new Captain America series, with the first issue rolling out on Independence Day. Mr. Coates, now in his second year of working on the acclaimed “Black Panther,” noted that he relishes the chance to adapt “ a walking emblem of greatest-generation propaganda” for the contemporary moment.

For Coates, taking on this icon was not about leaving his mark on the character but embodying what he called the character’s “Lincolnesque optimism.”

“The opportunity of writing ‘Captain America’ wasn’t to make Steve Rogers talk like the son of somebody who had been in the Black Panther Party,” he said in a phone interview with The Times. “The opportunity was the son of somebody who had been in the Black Panther Party to talk like Steve Rogers. To get into that perspective.”","Captain America No. 1, by Ta-Nehisi Coates, Annotated",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/04/books/captain-america-ta-nehisi-coates-annotated.html
588,588,2018-07-06,www.nytimes.com,"Workers will find the modest increase in hourly earnings — which falls a nose behind some measures of inflation — disappointing. But it does undercut the argument that the economy may be revving too fast.

The combination of middling pay raises and a bump up in the jobless rate should “take a little bit of pressure off the Federal Reserve to step up the pace of tightening,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist of High Frequency Economics, referring to the central bank’s debate over how quickly to raise benchmark interest rates.

Over the past three months, monthly payroll gains have averaged 211,000, and hiring has been running ahead of growth in the labor force. “There’s a gap there,” Mr. Sullivan noted, and without a steep and persistent plunge in hiring, “the unemployment rate is going to keep falling.”

The June report caps a string of encouraging economic reports. Many estimates for growth in the second quarter are bouncing above 4 percent. The manufacturing sector buzzed with activity last month, and spending on construction rose. New jobless claims are dragging along at historically low levels. And many consumers displayed their confidence in the economy by kicking off the summer with a new car purchase.

Anxieties over a harmful trade war, however, continue to cast shadows as $34 billion in additional tariffs on China went into effect on Friday, and the Chinese said they would retaliate. “They’re playing with fire, really,” Mr. O’Sullivan said of the Trump administration’s trade policies. The jobs report over all was very encouraging, he said, though “we could do with a scare in these numbers to force trade negotiations along.”

Hiring in the manufacturing sector nonetheless continued its surge, with 36,000 jobs added in June. Business and professional services as well as health care also had strong showings, while the retail sector slumped, losing 22,000 jobs.

The latest surveys of business owners around the country have been full of comments expressing dismay with the uncertainty generated by tariffs, whether newly imposed or threatened.

Last week, General Motors said that tariffs could lead to “less investment, fewer jobs and lower wages.” The motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson, based in Wisconsin, announced it would shift some production overseas to sidestep retaliatory tariffs imposed by European countries.

The United States Chamber of Commerce, warning that escalating tariffs would result in “lost sales and ultimately lost jobs here at home,” published a state-by-state breakdown this week showing exports that could be harmed along with estimates of the number of jobs that depend on global trade.

And on Thursday, the minutes from last month’s meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers were released. “Most participants noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified,” the Fed said, and it was “concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending.”

Chasing Higher Wages

As the jobless rate falls, employers’ complaints about their inability to find qualified, reliable workers mount.

“There’s more jobs than there are people available for jobs — at every level,” said Joe Galvin, chief research officer of Vistage, an association of small-business owners and executives. In a Vistage survey last month, an overwhelming share of employers spoke of their frustration in finding people to fill openings on the factory floor and in the executive suite, Mr. Galvin said.

To retain workers as well as attract new ones, employers say they are increasing pay, sweetening benefits packages and trying to create an appealing work culture.

Yet as the jobs report shows, average pay raises have been relatively measly considering the demand for labor. Workers, particularly in lower-wage sectors, have other complaints. Many employers limit hours to avoid paying benefits like health insurance. Work shifts frequently change with little notice, and wage increases are still insufficient to cover living costs. Stability and security are often scarce.

Child care, for instance, is an industry known for high turnover rates, low pay and a predominance of female workers.

“We are always looking for job candidates,” said Gigi Schweikert, president and chief operating officer of Lightbridge Academy, which operates child care facilities. “While many industries can move toward automation,” she said, “you can’t in caring for young children.”

The company is moving toward a $15-an-hour minimum over three years, Ms. Schweikert said. “We want to be more aggressive, but we can’t price parents out of the market,” she said. “We can only increase that parent tuition to a point where parents can afford it.”

Higher-wage earners are also in demand. DocuSign, an electronic-signature company with more than $500 million in annual revenue, added 100 sales, engineering and technical workers last month and intended to hire another 500 over the next six months, said Joan Burke, the company’s chief people officer.

“You just cannot be in this game without being competitive,” Ms. Burke said of salaries.

For most workers, the biggest pay gains are accompanied by a job change.

Andrew Chamberlain, the chief economist at Glassdoor, a jobs listing website, said he had noticed a weakening in the retail sector. “There’s been a precipitous decline in postings on Glassdoor in the past two months,” he said. (Most job losses from the demise of Toys “R” Us will probably show up in July.)

Still, announced job cuts in the sector have slowed substantially in the second quarter compared with the first, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement service.

Looking Ahead

Heightening trade tensions are not the only risks.

Mr. Chamberlain, like most other economists, warns that the economic high has been pumped up in part by deep tax cuts financed by ballooning debt. “We are in a miniboom being fueled by a tax stimulus in 2018 that’s not going to last,” he said.

Oxford Economics, an economic research firm, noted in its newsletter that with sluggish wage increases, consumers over the past couple of years had dipped into savings to finance spending. That habit can be particularly risky for lower-income families who could be easily knocked off course by a surge in energy prices or a large unexpected medical bill.",U.S. Hiring Stayed Strong in June Despite Trade Strains,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/business/economy/jobs-report.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer
589,589,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"“Sharp Objects” is about a murder case, but Camille Preaker (Amy Adams) is the real mystery.

Camille, a wayward, self-destructive newspaper reporter in St. Louis, gets an assignment that she’s particularly close to: the murder of one young girl and the disappearance of another in Wind Gap, the small town Camille fled years ago. Her editor (Miguel Sandoval) hopes she’ll find a sense of purpose as much as a prizewinning story.

She arrives back home carrying a bag of candy bars and vodka bottles, as well as a childhood’s worth of bad memories. Images of the past — a sister who died young, her distant mother, the town’s foreboding woods — flicker up in the middle of scenes, as if Camille’s head can’t contain them.

“Sharp Objects,” a mesmerizing eight-episode series beginning Sunday on HBO, is not the gothic crime thriller you might first suspect — at least not mainly. Instead, the show’s attention is drawn backward to Camille’s injuries, emotional, physical and self-inflicted. (The title alludes to her habit of cutting words into her flesh, leaving her body a dictionary of scars.)

Camille returns to the stately, rambling home of her mother, Adora (Patricia Clarkson), whose greeting is icy enough to chill a julep: “The house is not up to par for visitors.” Their history is being repeated in miniature by Camille’s young half sister, Amma (a captivating Eliza Scanlen), who is demure (like Adora) at home but wild and rebellious (like Camille) with her friends.","‘Sharp Objects,’ a Mesmerizing Southern Thriller, Cuts Slow but Deep",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/arts/television/sharp-objects-review-amy-adams-hbo.html

Its name entered Western history around 1699, in a grammar of the Kapampangan language of the Philippines written by a Spanish missionary, who defined it, briefly, as “to cook with vinegar,” giving no hint of its splendor.

In its earliest form, it was simply unripened fruit, doused with vinegar to make it sourer yet, and used as a palliative for morning sickness. Over time, meat supplanted fruit, and in the late 1960s, a street vendor in Angeles City started making sisig with pig face, hacked with two cleavers into a merry hash and blackened in a hot skillet with onions, chiles, vinegar and a squeeze of calamansi (an indigenous citrus that out-stings lime). Now sisig numbers among the world’s greatest foods to eat with beer, a sip and a bite, one consolation after another.

Mama Fina’s House of Filipino Sisig, which opened in the East Village in January, offers six varieties of the dish, including some of the city’s best. They come to the table seething in small cast-iron pans, nearly identical in appearance, roughly chopped nubs of meat or tofu in shades of brown, some pieces having survived the heat still lush and others turned to crackle.

Arcs of red onion gleam, while chiles lay low. Where cooks in the Philippines sometimes rely on pig brains to give the dish body, here the secret is cream.

But unlike Mr. Pruitt — who had come to Washington as an outsider and aspiring politician, only to get caught up in a swirl of controversy over his costly first-class travel and security spending — Mr. Wheeler is viewed as a consummate Washington insider who avoids the limelight and has spent years effectively navigating the rules.

For that reason, Mr. Wheeler’s friends and critics alike say, he could ultimately prove to be more adept than his controversial former boss in the job.

“You want a tariff-free, you want no barriers, and you want no subsidies, because you have some cases where countries are subsidizing industries, and that’s not fair,” he said at the Group of 7 meeting in Quebec. “So you go tariff-free, you go barrier-free, you go subsidy-free. That’s the way you learned at the Wharton School of finance. I mean, that would be the ultimate thing.”

But he also lamented that the United States is “a piggy bank everybody is robbing,” spurned the G-7’s joint communiqué that rejected protectionism, and is imposing tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese exports, all signs that he’s actually moving in the opposite direction.

Parts of the shelter resembled a typical school: brightly lit, white-walled rooms with white boards and rows of desks, and long hallways decorated with elaborate murals. One hallway displayed a giant construction paper cutout of a tree — an illustration of the three branches of government. Part of the curriculum at the shelter at the time focused on American civics and government, to coincide with the Fourth of July holiday, but there seemed to be a permanent emphasis on American patriotism and geography.

One wall in the cafeteria showed a map of the country, with the outlines of the states in bold colors. Elsewhere, the walls were emblazoned with images and quotations in Spanish and English from American presidents, from Lincoln to Trump.

The Southwest Key officials on the tour were proud of the shelter’s educational focus. But there are more than 100 facilities across the country where migrant children are detained — some run by nonprofits such as Southwest Key, others by private prison companies and government agencies — and the overall quality of the education they provide largely remains a mystery because much of what happens in the shelters is rarely seen by the public.

At Berks County Residential Center, an ICE facility in Pennsylvania, there are two classrooms, one for children aged 2 to 11 and another for children 12 to 18, according to Eleanor Acer, of the nonprofit Human Rights First. Ms. Acer, who has visited the center several times, said that the wide age span left the older children in each group bored, and that much of the instruction was done through computers and worksheets.

She added that some teachers were unable to communicate effectively in Spanish, and that classes cycle through the curriculum every two weeks, meaning students who stay longer repeat the same material.

“The impression is that they are not really taught much of anything,” Ms. Acer said.

Adrian Smith, a spokesman for ICE, said that teachers at Berks are either certified in English as a second language or working toward such a certification. Children are grouped across age ranges, he said in a written statement, because of the “varying academic abilities of students.”","In a Migrant Shelter Classroom, ‘It’s Always Like the First Day of School’",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/us/immigrants-shelters-schools-border.html

This generation, unlike the ones that came before it, is as likely as not to earn less than their parents. Among people who did not plan to have children, 23 percent said it was because they were worried about the economy. A third said they couldn’t afford child care, 24 percent said they couldn’t afford a house and 13 percent cited student debt.

Financial concerns also led people to have fewer children than what they considered to be ideal: 64 percent said it was because child care was too expensive, 43 percent said they waited too long because of financial instability and about 40 percent said it was because of a lack of paid family leave.

Women face another economic obstacle: Their careers can stall when they become mothers.

This spring, Brittany Butler, 22, became the first person in her family to graduate from college, and she will start graduate school in social work in the fall.

600,600,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"Very Impressive. What About the Vague Clues?

Once again, you raise a good point. Clues like 1A’s “Ruler who died in 30 B.C.” might seem unfair, because how are you supposed to know that? But we have nine letters and we know it’s a name. So let’s figure this out.

Back to the crossings. At first, the only Down entry I was able to get right away was 4D’s OLÉ. I’ll be honest with you; the northwest was the last sector to fall for me. But I knew that there probably weren’t many rulers whose name ended in a B, so I changed the pickle entry from BIT to ATE. That helped. Now I had an O and an A. I still didn’t know enough to get it, so you know what I did? I gave up and took a nap.

Ha ha, just kidding! I didn’t do that at all. I skipped to another section of the grid. You’d be surprised how your brain continues to work on problems in the background even when you are tackling something else. The confounding 1A would just have to wait.

And what did my eye skip to? Another thing I didn’t know: 27D’s “Letters sung as mi, mi, re, re, do” totally stumped me, even though my brain was screaming at me that I really did know the answer. So, once again, I leaned on the crossings. I somehow knew that ARIAS were the unlikely Top 40 songs of 33A, and that gave me the first I. I already had the middle letter E from MEET IN THE MIDDLE, and I quickly got OTOE for 41A because it’s always OTOE, isn’t it? (Except when it’s UTE.)

So now I had _IE_O and, somewhere in my brain, the cell responsible for filing away old children’s songs came running in, waving a page of sheet music and yelling, “It’s Old MacDonald! E-I-E-I-O!” And now I know that part of the tune is sung to “mi, mi, re, re, do.” You learn something new every day, if you’re open to it.

My point is, give it time. Don’t expect to race through a Friday puzzle. A puzzle that crosses MEET IN THE MIDDLE with RACE TO THE BOTTOM is meant to be savored anyway. And above all, don’t give up (although a good nap is highly underrated). Use the crossings, Luke, and skip to another part of the puzzle if what you’re working on seems impossible. It won’t seem so hard once you have a few letters in there and your brain has had a chance to work on the ones you didn’t get right away.

Oh, and 1A turned out to be CLEOPATRA. I found that out because I didn’t give up.

O.K., Fine. I’ll Give It a Try. But You Promise You Won’t Be Mad if I Make a Mistake?

That’s the spirit! And no, how could I be mad at you, with those big eyes?",Got Into a Pickle,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/crosswords/daily-puzzle-2018-07-06.html

“The Europeans come through. They knock out the humans. They knock out the dogs,” he said. Given the necessary caveats that a pocket of dogs with substantial ancient American ancestry could turn up somewhere, Dr. Larson said that he was convinced by the evidence so far that, “It’s a complete disappearance.”

[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]

Laurent Frantz, an ancient DNA expert at Queen Mary University of London, who led the research, said that until now, there had not been enough evidence to know “the story of these dogs and what happened to them after the Europeans arrived.” Now, he said, it is clear that the pre-contact dogs were an identifiable group, separate from any other, and that some combination of disease and European persecution of native dogs led to their disappearance.

Elaine Ostrander, a comparative geneticist at the National Institutes of Health, who studies dogs as a model for human cancers, and who has reported traces of ancient American dog DNA in some modern breeds, said the study was “unique, really well done.” But she was not giving up hope for the possibility of uncovering dogs somewhere with a substantial portion of DNA from ancient American dogs.

Fifty researchers collaborated on the study, which included both biological and archaeological evidence. They derived DNA from the remains of 71 ancient dogs from the Americas and Siberia and compared them to genomes of modern dogs.",The Lost Dogs of the Americas,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/science/dog-american-genome.html

Scores from the National Assessment of Educational Progress state that in 2014, only 18 percent of 8th grade students scored “at” or “above proficient” in American History and 23 percent scored “at” or “above proficient” in civics.

A survey last year by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania found that 37 percent of those surveyed couldn’t name any of the rights guaranteed under the First Amendment and about 75 percent don’t know all three branches of government.

For years, a number of organizations have promoted teaching civics, such as the Center for Civic Education which provides curriculums and holds annual competitions for upper elementary and middle-school students, iCivics, a nonprofit civics education group started by the former Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O’Connor, and the Civics Education Initiative, which lobbies states to require students to pass a civics test before graduating.

But more needs to be done, especially in light of the divided state of the country, many say, and individuals and institutions are taking on the challenge. One example is Polaris Charter Academy in Chicago, whose students last year led a campaign to address gun violence in their community; as part of that they studied the Constitution and the Second Amendment and worked with legislators, police, activists and gang members.

“This is not just about a high school civics class. — It’s not to prepare students for tests, but to prepare them to be active, contributing citizens,” said Ron Berger, chief academic officer of EL Education, a nonprofit network of about 160 public district and charter schools nationwide. “We’ve forgotten about that as a nation.” Polaris is one of EL Education’s schools.","In the Age of Trump, Civics Courses Make a Comeback",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/education/learning/schools-civics-trump.html

“In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

A stately pleasure-dome decree:

Mr. Kalish offers us five phrases (some are more common than others), and some of the letters in these phrases are circled. Those letters spell words that can be preceded by the word SECRET, and we get a big hint in the revealer at 59A: IT’S A SECRET, clued as “‘Keep this between us’ … or hint to this puzzle's circled letters.”

Don’t see it? Let’s look at 16A: “Italian food item that can be stuffed and baked” is PASTA SHELL, which contains the word STASH in the circled letters. Put the word SECRET in front of it, and you get SECRET STASH, like the good chocolate that I keep in the back of the freezer so my kids won’t eat it.

Constructor’s Notes

As with many constructors, this marks the fulfillment of a long time dream. I’ve always loved playing with words, and back in middle school I would eagerly await Will Shortz’s next Sunday Puzzle challenge, tuning in to NPR at exactly 10:41 a.m. (But who’s counting?). In college, I was inspired by the work of Dustin Foley, who wrote a daily puzzle comic strip. Back then I was filling 15x15 grids printed from Microsoft Word, and the results weren’t particularly encouraging. (To wit: Once I tried asking a crush out via crossword on Valentine’s Day. It went unsolved.) Puzzling at Brown really took off soon after I graduated, and I vowed that one day I would join the ranks of Shortz-certified Brunonian cruciverbalists. [Insert training montage here.] I’m a huge road trip enthusiast, and over time I’ve come to realize the importance of certain life skills … like navigating the secret menu at In-N-Out Burger. (Psst … think Will would allow “Animal Style” in a grid?) I first considered a SECRET MENU puzzle in 2014, lamenting that the only decent phrase I could find a secret “menu” in was PRIME NUMBER. Years later, “IT’S A SECRET” struck me as a good revealer, leading to this puzzle. The veritable cornucopia of potential thematic material led to high ambitions and an inevitable Grid Reckoning. It eventually led me to attempt a theme answer stack à la Patrick Berry, though the challenge left this mere mortal with the unfortunate TELNET and cheater squares at 6- and 65-Across. Considering that every down answer intersects between one and three theme entries, I was pleased to keep the damage fairly contained. (I know, ID EST can be a bit of a party pooper … though initially he’s great.) Hopefully MARKUP LANGUAGE — the ‘ML’ of ‘HTML’ — isn’t too outré for a Monday puzzle. My favorite find was WHAT A GENTLEMAN, a comment I’ve heard in the wild! SHOPPER, à la GRASSHOPPER, was the coolest possibility I didn’t incorporate. Hope you enjoyed the puzzle! I’d like to thank Jeff Chen, who has a) put up with me for years as I’ve learned the ropes and peppered him with random crossword ideas; and b) made great resources available for budding constructors everywhere.

Among them was a suite of historic regulations aimed at mitigating global warming pollution from the United States’ vehicles and power plants.

[Mr. Wheeler shares Mr. Pruitt’s zeal to dismantle climate change regulations. Read more here.]

Mr. Pruitt also played a lead role in urging Mr. Trump to follow through on his campaign pledge to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, despite warnings from some of the president’s other senior advisers that the move could damage the United States’ credibility in foreign policy. Under the landmark accord, nearly every country had committed to reducing emissions of planet-warming fossil fuel pollution.

In 2017, Mr. Pruitt made headlines for questioning the established science of human-caused climate change, contradicting decades of research by scientific institutions, including his own agency. Although Mr. Pruitt was harshly criticized for the remarks, they did not affect his good standing with a president who has also mocked climate science.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly told associates that Mr. Pruitt has done what he has wanted in terms of cutting regulations, so he has been reluctant to let him go. Mr. Pruitt, for his part, had made himself available to the president as a confidant.

HomeZada, an app for homeowners, aims to bring order to the chaos with checklists, schedules and a home-inventory tool; unless you pay $8 a month for the premium version, however, the service is bare-bones.

California gas prices are spiking, as they do each summer as the state switches to a lower-pollution — but more expensive — blend. The average price for regular gasoline is $3.66 a gallon in California, far above the national average of $2.80, according to figures compiled by the AAA.

Mr. Brown just signed his final budget, which projects a $6.1 billion surplus, money that Republicans are arguing should be used for road repairs instead of the gas tax and keep Californians from paying more at the pump.

California Republicans have seized on the issue. Taxes have long been a point of divisions between Republicans and Democrats, and all the more so since Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans enacted a tax reform bill that severely reduced deductions for state and local taxes, posing a particular burden for California homeowners. Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican who is the House majority leader and looking to become its next speaker, has contributed money to the repeal in an effort to save seven Republican congressional seats.

Mr. Cox said he had found a “ton of support” for the repeal.

“Whenever I am out campaigning, I always talk to working people — valet parking people, the desk clerks, the people behind the counter,” he said. “I ask people what do they think about the cost of living and the gas tax. And they say: ‘We can’t take this. We had to move an extra 20 miles away because we couldn’t find an apartment we could afford. And now we are sitting in traffic burning up gasoline at almost $5 a gallon.’”

“Mr. Brown and Mr. Newsom are being dishonest when they say these projects will come to a halt if we don’t have this tax,” he said. “They know that these road projects could be done if we changed work rules, if we used money more efficiently, if we cut better deals to make the process more efficiently.”

A U.S.C. Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll in May found 38 percent of voters said they supported the gas tax, a perilously low number; only 49 percent of Democrats said they supported it.

The crisis over judicial independence in Poland took a new turn on Thursday, when nearly half the judges on the country’s other top court, the Constitutional Tribunal, said its workings had become politicized and dysfunctional, casting into doubt the validity of crucial rulings it had made over the last two years.

Taken together, the purge of the Supreme Court and the open rebellion within the Constitutional Tribunal underscored the tensions over the future of the rule of law in a nation that once represented post-communist hopes for democracy but that is now under the grip of an increasingly authoritarian — though legitimately elected — government.

But whether the plan can actually change Wadleigh for the better is an open question.

Aaron Pallas, a professor of sociology and education at Teachers College, Columbia University, noted that Wadleigh has trouble with order, safety, teacher-principal trust, instructional leadership and the coherence of its teaching, according to city statistics. Only 53 percent of Wadleigh’s teachers, for example, agreed that order and discipline were maintained there.

How the new plan will result in “better leadership, better teaching, more trust, more order and safety is still a big mystery to me,” Mr. Pallas said.

The school’s supporters — including nearly the entire political establishment of Harlem, the president of the N.A.A.C.P.’s New York branch and the head of the Harlem Chamber of Commerce — argue that its abysmal test scores are not the whole story. The school, which moved to its Harlem location in 1902, had met two-thirds of its Renewal school benchmarks, though the rigor of those requirements has been questioned.

Enrollment in the middle school increased to 70 students last year, they pointed out, with some 300 city families listing the school on their middle school applications. And its test scores, as low as they were, were only slightly worse than those at schools with similar student populations.

The community leaders explained to Mr. Carranza that the school’s math teachers had left en masse in the 2015-16 school year, after differences with school leaders, and that there had been a revolving door of math teachers since.

So, how do you leaf through the 50 hand-printed issues of Alfred Stieglitz’s Camera Work without distraction or fear of causing a disaster?

After all, there are fewer collectors than fingers on a hand that own a complete set of Camera Work, Stieglitz’s groundbreaking publication that helped shepherd photography into the art world. With brittle covers and fine photogravures, finding even one undamaged volume is a an unnerving challenge. But, Mark Katzman, a photographer based in St. Louis, figured it out. He spent the same amount of time Stieglitz did running the publication — 15 years — finding ways to collect an entire set.

“I’m not wealthy, so it’s been a lot of elbow grease to try to make it happen,” said Mr. Katzman who is now working with another photographer, Pierre Vreyen, to make a facsimile of his entire Camera Work collection.",Revisiting the Images of Alfred Stieglitz’s Camera Work Magazine,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/lens/revisiting-the-images-of-alfred-stieglitz-camera-work-magazine.html
619,619,2017-06-01,www.nytimes.com,"SPECIAL POST — Some solvers love them, some solvers hate them, but rebus elements are a fact of life when it comes to solving crosswords.

Readers who are just starting to solve ask different questions when there is a rebus in a puzzle:

Wait, what? You’re allowed to put more than one letter or word in a square? Yes. Yes, you are. But only when the puzzle calls for it. You can’t just do it randomly. Aren’t we supposed to be warned when a rebus exists in the puzzle? No, that’s part of the fun of solving. If more than one rebus exists in a square — and why do you do this to us? — is there a way to predict the order in which the rebus elements are supposed to be entered? Yes, there is. The Across entry is entered first, and then the Down entry. We give examples below. How am I supposed to put more than one letter or word in a square if I am solving online or on my device? Keep reading. We explain that in the last section.

What is a Rebus?

A rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square.

You’ll find two kinds of letter-based rebus elements in a crossword.

The first is where the rebus entry reads the same for both the intersecting Across and Down entries, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.","Yes, You Can Write More Than One Letter in a Square",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/crosswords/yes-you-can-write-more-than-one-letter-in-a-square.html

Can you think of anyone who pleads powerlessness one moment and demands fealty the next?

Trump occasionally comes up by name in this book, but Nussbaum seems to consider him a degrading presence, preferring to sequester his coarsest comments about women in a tidy itemized list. One gets the sense that the more upsetting something is for Nussbaum, the more exacting she becomes; her meticulous methods and crystalline logic are constructed like armor.

Nussbaum has long had a propensity for orderly routines. She recalls being “transfixed and traumatized” by Verdi’s “Rigoletto” at the age of 6; to manage her feelings she re-enacted the death scene over and over again at home by putting her doll in a sack. Her cool approach to incendiary topics is part of what makes her work so brilliant and so frustrating. To counter the “toxic brew” of fearful anger, envy and misogyny, she proposes … “strategies.” She’s not necessarily wrong, but does she have to sound so bloodless and Apollonian about it?

She’s such a stickler for civility that she can make some baffling both-sides comparisons. Trump supporters might be fearful of liberal college students, she says, but her students are fearful of Trump supporters too. Against the envy that some white men feel toward women and people of color making gains in the workplace, she repeatedly brings up the envy of those who think that “elite bankers” and “big business” have too much. Judging from her calls for critics of capitalism to purge themselves of “negative desire,” you wouldn’t guess that responding to real exploitation had anything to do with it.

When it comes to seeing the small, scared child in everyone, though, Nussbaum can be illuminating. Drawing from the work of the British pediatrician and psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, who observed that children could only grow out of their infantile fearfulness if the parent provided the right kind of “facilitating environment,” she asks: “What should we be striving for as a nation, if we want children to become capable of concern, reciprocity and also happiness?”

She must have written those words long before Americans learned last month that the government was separating migrant parents from their children at the border, but the idea of the nation valuing “concern, reciprocity and also happiness” for children, even as an ideal that it doesn’t live up to, sounds positively, distressingly quaint. When the vulnerability of children becomes less a reason for protection than an opportunity to do harm, perhaps some fear really is in order.","When It Comes to Politics, Be Afraid.

623,623,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"Just when America had all but given up hope, Scott Pruitt’s appalling reign as Environmental Protection Agency administrator is finally over. Thursday afternoon, Mr. Pruitt delivered President Trump his resignation letter, replete with references to “God’s providence” and how “blessed” he was to have had the opportunity to serve not the nation, but this president. He sadly noted that “the unrelenting attacks on me personally, my family, are unprecedented and have taken a sizable toll on all of us.” And so Mr. Pruitt heads for the door, leaving behind a dark, oily stain on the office that he has spent the past year and a half vigorously defiling.

Mr. Pruitt’s departure did not come as a total shock. Word around Washington in recent weeks was that the stench of corruption wafting from E.P.A. headquarters was getting to be too much even for Mr. Trump. Someone in the White House no doubt noticed that, with the midterms approaching, Mr. Pruitt was not playing well with any voter who retains some common sense. In an administration characterized by extreme swampiness and ethical flexibility, the E.P.A. chief had nonetheless distinguished himself with pathological grifting to the point that even some Republican lawmakers and reliably conservative commentators had begun publicly slapping him.

Still, for months, Mr. Pruitt held on to his job as the embarrassing revelations piled up like so many used mattresses: his profligate spending on posh travel, over-the-top security, and ridiculous, self-aggrandizing office supplies; his directing agency staffers to run his personal errands, including finding him a place to live in Washington and combing hotels for his favorite skin cream; his attempts to score his wife a high-paying job, possibly involving chicken nuggets and waffle fries. Every week seemed to bring fresh examples of Mr. Pruitt’s shameless and yet surprisingly petty misuse of his office.

Mr. Trump’s willingness to tolerate Mr. Pruitt’s chicanery was not surprising. The two men share an environmental philosophy that may be roughly summarized as “industry over science,” and, for all his flaws, Mr. Pruitt was tireless in the crusade to dismantle environmental protections. His greatest hits include playing a key role in getting Mr. Trump to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement; pushing the repeal of numerous Obama-era regulations, including those to cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and automobiles; and instituting a policy that barred scientists who receive federal grants from serving on the E.P.A.’s advisory committees, while simultaneously welcoming corporate representatives onto these panels. Just last month, The Times reported that the E.P.A. had decided for the most part not to consider exposure to chemicals through the air, water or ground when it is evaluating whether they should be regulated or banned under a bipartisan law passed in 2016.",Opinion | We’ll All Be Paying for Scott Pruitt for Ages,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/opinion/scott-pruitt-epa-resigns-corruption.html

The event was first held at the track in 1950, but the British Racing Drivers’ Club, which runs the race, exercised its option to break its contract after the 2019 race.

“We have reached the tipping point where we can no longer let our passion for the sport rule our heads,” John Grant, the club chairman, said when the announcement was made last summer. “Put simply, it is no longer financially viable for us to deliver the British Grand Prix under the terms of our current contract.

“However, I want to be clear that although we have now activated the break clause, we are fully supportive of the changes the Liberty team are making to improve the F1 experience,” he said, referring to the Liberty Media Corporation, which owns Formula One. “Our hope is that an agreement can still be reached, so that we can ensure a sustainable and financially viable future for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone for many years to come.”",British Grand Prix May Need a New Home in 2020,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/sports/autoracing/british-grand-prix-new-home.html
625,625,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"“The white zin days are long behind us,” she said.

Our No. 1 bottle was an old friend, the Edmunds St. John Bone Jolly gamay noir rosé from El Dorado County in California — savory, saline and simply delicious. Gamay noir is the grape of Beaujolais, hence the egregious Bone Jolly pun. Nonetheless, Steve Edmunds has pioneered modern gamay production in California, making both a red and this rosé, which has been superb year in and year out.

Perhaps coincidentally, our No. 3 wine was also a gamay noir rosé, the Folk Machine from Arroyo Seco in the Central Coast. It was dry and succulent, but a very different style: more delicate and ephemeral than the Bone Jolly, which could easily age a couple of years.

Sandwiched between the two gamay noirs was the North Valley pinot noir rosé from Soter in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, lively and refreshing, with flavors of herbs, berries and the bloody tang of iron. Rounding out the top four was the high-toned, earthy Porter Creek, made from old vines of carignan from Mendocino, blended with a small percentage of zinfandel grown next door to the winery in the Russian River Valley.

As you may have inferred, rosé can be made of any red grape. Rather than allow the grape juice to macerate for long with the pigment-bearing skins, as they would a red wine, producers whisk away the skins after the juice has absorbed the preferred amount of color.

In another method used more rarely, a small portion of the juice is bled off to be used for rosé, leaving the remainder for red. This method, saignée, from the French word for bleed, concentrates the remaining juice intended for red by increasing the ratio of skins to juice. Except for sparkling wines, it is not permitted to blend white and red wine to make rosé.

No. 5 was another old friend, the Robert Sinskey vin gris, a French term for a pale rosé, made of pinot noir grown in Los Carneros, a lively wine with floral, citrus and herbal flavors. The Sinskey was followed by the tart, juicy Fausse Piste Oyster Sauce, made from grenache from the Rogue Valley in southern Oregon, and the fresh Macari — from the North Fork of Long Island, and made of malbec and petit verdot — which had an unusual tutti-frutti, watermelon flavor.

Three more to keep in mind are the stony, citrusy Matthiasson, made from a combination of grenache, syrah, mourvèdre and counoise grown in three different sites in Northern California; the savory, floral Flower, Flora and Fauna from Idlewild in Mendocino, made from nebbiolo, barbera and dolcetto; and the subtle, soft, Gramercy Cellars, made of cinsault grown in the Olsen Vineyard in the Columbia Valley of Washington.",American Rosés Without Clichés,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/dining/drinks/wine-review-rose-american.html
626,626,2018-07-06,www.nytimes.com,"At the largest migrant youth shelter in the country — a former Walmart in Brownsville, Tex., where the nonprofit Southwest Key Programs houses and educates 1,500 boys aged 10 to 17 — officials made it a point to show off the facility’s classrooms on a media tour in June.

Parts of the shelter resembled a typical school: brightly lit, white-walled rooms with white boards and rows of desks, and long hallways decorated with elaborate murals. One hallway displayed a giant construction paper cutout of a tree — an illustration of the three branches of government. Part of the curriculum at the shelter at the time focused on American civics and government, to coincide with the Fourth of July holiday, but there seemed to be a permanent emphasis on American patriotism and geography.

One wall in the cafeteria showed a map of the country, with the outlines of the states in bold colors. Elsewhere, the walls were emblazoned with images and quotations in Spanish and English from American presidents, from Lincoln to Trump.

The Southwest Key officials on the tour were proud of the shelter’s educational focus. But there are more than 100 facilities across the country where migrant children are detained — some run by nonprofits such as Southwest Key, others by private prison companies and government agencies — and the overall quality of the education they provide largely remains a mystery because much of what happens in the shelters is rarely seen by the public.

At Berks County Residential Center, an ICE facility in Pennsylvania, there are two classrooms, one for children aged 2 to 11 and another for children 12 to 18, according to Eleanor Acer, of the nonprofit Human Rights First. Ms. Acer, who has visited the center several times, said that the wide age span left the older children in each group bored, and that much of the instruction was done through computers and worksheets.

She added that some teachers were unable to communicate effectively in Spanish, and that classes cycle through the curriculum every two weeks, meaning students who stay longer repeat the same material.

“The impression is that they are not really taught much of anything,” Ms. Acer said.

Adrian Smith, a spokesman for ICE, said that teachers at Berks are either certified in English as a second language or working toward such a certification. Children are grouped across age ranges, he said in a written statement, because of the “varying academic abilities of students.”","In a Migrant Shelter Classroom, ‘It’s Always Like the First Day of School’",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/us/immigrants-shelters-schools-border.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer
627,627,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"GREAT FALLS, Mont. — President Trump lobbed personal and derogatory attacks at two Democratic senators, mocked the #MeToo movement and vouched for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Thursday during a freewheeling, raucous rally ostensibly intended to solidify support for Montana’s Republican Senate candidate.

Taunting Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, with a refusal to apologize for calling her “Pocahontas,” Mr. Trump imagined a debate during which he would gently throw an ancestry testing kit at Ms. Warren to make her prove the Native American heritage she has controversially claimed.

“We are going to do it gently because we’re the #MeToo generation, so we have to be very careful,” the president said to scattered laughter, adding that he would donate $1 million to charity if Ms. Warren followed through. Mr. Trump, who has faced accusations of sexual assault and harassment, announced earlier in the day that Bill Shine, who was ousted from Fox News over his handling of the network’s harassment scandals, would take a position on his administration’s communications staff.

Mr. Trump was in Montana, he unabashedly told the crowd, to settle a political score with Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat who is tangled in a tough re-election campaign with Matt Rosendale, the state auditor.

628,628,2018-07-06,www.nytimes.com,"With only a single serious threat to worry about, France did so successfully, taking Suarez out of the match. Hugo Lloris only had to make one difficult save, a brilliant parry of a Martín Cáceres header before halftime. But in open play, France shut everything else down, and Uruguay didn’t manage a single shot on goal in the second half.

France got on the board in the 40th minute, when Griezmann took a free kick after a foul by Rodrigo Bentancur, who had taken down Corentin Tolisso from behind. Griezmann lofted the ball in, and Varane rocketed in a header.

Uruguay kept pace with France in the first half, not in passes, but in shots, and created its own great scoring opportunity minutes later. Lucas Torreira took a free kick and sent it toward Caceres, who fired a close-in header downward toward the left post. But Lloris dove to his right and made a beautiful one-handed save, pushing the ball wide. The ball dribbled loose for a moment and Uruguay’s Diego Godin arrived to try to convert the rebound, but he failed to bundle it in.

After that near miss, Uruguay struggled to create chances.

France went ahead by 2-0 in the 61st minute. Breaking as part of a four-on-four, Griezmann tried a shot from distance. It should have been be a relatively routine save for Muslera, but it hit his hands, popped up, went over his head and into the goal.

The game got ill-tempered soon after. After contact with Cristian Rodriguez of Uruguay, Kylian Mbappe went down, setting off both sides. Godin, suspecting play acting, urged Mbappe to get up. Players tangled, and there was shouting, pushing and shoving. For a moment, it calmed down, then started up again. In the end there was a yellow card for both Rodriguez and Mbappe.

France then set about killing off the game, controlling possession and not letting Uruguay get much more than a sniff of the ball.

France won’t face such an impotent offense in the semifinals, where either Neymar and Philippe Coutinho of Brazil or Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne of Belgium await. But Les Blues have no obvious holes to exploit, and there is no easy way to stifle their attack. It wouldn’t be surprising to see them lift the World Cup trophy in Moscow next Sunday.

Here’s how France eliminated Uruguay:

90’: + 5 for Uruguay

Five minutes of stoppage time here, but it would be a miracle if Uruguay notched one goal, let alone two.

89’: Griezmann Takes Another One

Can Antoine Griezmann make it three from a free kick? No, over the bar.

87’: Mbappe Comes Off

France is killing this game off extremely effectively. And that’s all for Kylian Mbappe, who will be replaced by Ousmane Dembele.

84’: No Punch for Uruguay

Jonathan Urreta tries to get a little fancy and finds some room, but a bad touch lets him down. Uruguay don’t look very threatening right now without Edinson Cavani.

Kevin Draper: Luis Suarez is dummying the ball and trying other inventive things, but Uruguay can’t generate anything. They haven’t even managed a shot on goal this half, despite being down for the majority of it.

79’: Changes for France

Sevilla defensive midfielder Steven Nzonzi is coming on for Corentin Tolisso, as France looks to solidify their defense and wrap this game up.

77’: Giroud Fires ... Wide

France keeps the ball away from a frustrated Uruguay for minutes. The move segues into a nice dribble by Mbappe, but Giroud finally ends it by stonking a volley wide.

Kevin Draper: Uruguay doesn’t seem particularly confident in their ability to bypass the French midfield. They are either playing long balls and hoping one of their forwards can knock them down, or sending crosses in from the wing.

73’: Uruguay Makes Final Sub

Uruguay makes their final change, bringing on Monterrey winger Jonathan Urretaviscaya for Nahitan Nández. France still has all three changes available.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Kevin Draper: France is sitting back a bit and letting Uruguay control more possession, but are still knocking the ball around and attacking when they get a chance. Uruguay is going to have a few more chances, but France will have just as many.

74’: France Close!

France has numbers in the box, and Tolisso makes the possibly wrong decision to shoot rather than pass. The decision looks even worse when the shot flies over the bar.

Photo

68’: Fight!

After contact with Rodriguez, Mbappe goes down, and that sets off both sides, as players tangle and there is shouting, pushing and shoving. Godin urges Mbappe to get to his feet. For a moment, it calms down, then starts up again. Yellow card for both Rodriguez and Mbappe.

60’: GOAL! Griezmann Makes it 2-0

France breaks with a four-on-four and Griezmann tries one from distance. It should be a relatively routine save for Muslera, but it hit his hands, pops up, goes over his head and into the goal. A goalkeeper howler!

Kevin Draper: No complicated analysis needed on the goal: That was a disaster for Uruguay, and leaves them with little chance of a comeback. They’re going to have to really throw men forward and chase this game, a position they aren’t used to being in at this World Cup. In fact, this game is the first time they’ve trailed at all during the World Cup, let alone by two goals.

59’: Changes for Uruguay

Celta Vigo striker Maxi Gómez and Peñarol winger Cristian Rodríguez have come in for Cristhian Stuani and Rodrigo Betancur.

Starting for the injured Edinson Cavani, it is safe to say Stuani never got into the game, and it would be surprising to learn he had more then about a dozen touches.

Uruguay manager Óscar Tabárez has apparently decided the unit on the field wasn’t likely to score, and so he’s playing his hand early.

59’: Uruguay Stronger Now

Uruguay gets some possession and zips the ball around the box a bit. But the move is foiled by a woeful shot by Caceres, miles in the sky.

56’: Uruguay Strikes Back

Bentancur, whose foul set up the free kick that gave France its lead, appears to try to make amends with a long range shot, Too high.

Kevin Draper: Uruguay seems to be playing faster this half, leading to attacking opportunities, but also to fouls and bigger gaps in the midfield.

53’: Pavard Goes High

France is bossing the game a bit now. A corner is cleared, but Pavard drills a shot from distance on the rebound. Over the bar.

51’: Dangerous Free Kick for France

Kylian Mbappe sends a free kick into a tangle of French and Uruguayan bodies, but the first contact is with keeper Muslera’s fist.

Kevin Draper: For a team with such an intelligent defense, Uruguay gives away a number of free kicks in dangerous areas, which seems especially stupid considering that’s how France got the only goal in this game.

48’: Danger for Uruguay

Uruguay almost blunders into giving away a goal. Goalkeeper Fernando Muslera was way too casual on the ball, and Griezmann came close to blocking his rushed clearance into the goal.

47’: Free Kick for France

First free kick of the half to Antoine Griezmann: he loops it over his attackers and straight to the keeper.

46’: Here We Go

Uruguay immediately tries to push forward but France’s midfield takes it away and push forward.

Who Is Cristhian Stuani?

From Gonzalo Higuain to Luis Suarez to Edinson Cavani, modern Uruguay has always had world class strikers. But with Cavani is out, it’s time to get to know his replacement, Cristhian Stuani.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Stuani is a bit of a journeyman, bouncing around Italy, Spain and England before finding a home at Girona. He scored the 5th most goals in La Liga this season, behind guys like Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. He made a number of substitute appearances for Uruguay at the last World Cup, and has been a regular on the national team for the last six years.

The Numbers

The halftime stats offer some hope for Uruguay. France has played the deliberate short-passing game, completing 209 passes to Uruguay’s 114. But Uruguay’s more direct style has kept it on par in shots: it has 7 to France’s 6. Moreover, Uruguay has four shots on target; France has just one, its goal.

Photo

Halftime: France 1, Uruguay 0

Kevin Draper: Despite being down a goal, that was a pretty good first half performance for Uruguay. They completely neutralized Kylian Mbappé, and snuffed out practically every dangerous-looking French attack, while getting a number of shots on goal at the other end of the field.

45’: Great Save by Lloris!

Save of the game! Torreira takes a free kick and Caceres is there for a close-in header. But Lloris dives right and makes a one-hander. The ball dribbles loose and Godin arrives, but can’t bundle it in. Great chance for Uruguay.

42’: Uruguay Pushing Now

Uruguay pushes forward in response and Nandez fires a sudden shot from 35 yards that is right on target. But Lloris is up to it and makes the save.

Photo

39’: GOAL! France Leads 1-0

France 1-0. Griezmann takes the free kick off that foul, lofts it in, and Varane rockets it in with his head.

Kevin Draper: That French goal was just what this game needed to liven up a bit. Uruguay hoped it could win 1-0 with an impenetrable defense and a moment of Luis Suarez magic, but now it’ll have to chase the game.

39’: Yellow for Betancur

Bentancur picks up a yellow for taking down Tolisso from behind. Tolisso executed a nice double roll on that foul. Dangerous free kick for France!

35’: Vecino Blocked by Lloris

Uruguay gets a good chance out of nothing, as the last in a succession of 50-50 balls bounces to Matías Vecino in the box, and he gets off a half-volley that ultimately doesn’t trouble Hugo Lloris enough.

35’: France on the Breakout

Samuel Umtiti passes forward, and Mbappe nabs the ball at the corner. He has a little space for once and shoots a ball past the outstretched hand of Mulera. It rolls across the length of the box slowly, without a lot of defenders around. But absolutely no French players are in sight.

34’: Yellow for Hernandez

Lucas Hernandez of France blatantly grabs the jersey of Nandez to slow him down. Nothing subtle about that. A clear yellow card.

Photo

31’: Mbappe Misses a Chance

Pavard, who has been active, sends in a nice cross with three Frenchmen in the box, Giroud, Mbappe and Tolisso. But it kind of rolls over Mbappe’s feet and skitters out of play. That could have been a good chance.

27’: Uruguay Hassling Mbappe

Kylian Mbappe and Diego Laxalt get tangled at the sidelines. They don’t seem happy with each other This game has been physical, with a number of stoppages for injured players.

Kevin Draper: Uruguay’s early brightness has dulled, and the match is becoming the French-controlled affair we expected. France has 63 percent of the possession and twice as many completed passes, as they are probing for openings while Uruguay makes riskier, longer and more direct passes when they get the ball.

26’: Another Corner for France

Kylian Mbappe slides into a dangerous area, but Uruguay clears it for a corner. Again, Griezmann takes it, but this time goes short.

Rough Start

We are 24 minutes in, and there have already been 11 fouls committed, six of them by Uruguay. No yellow cards yet, but with the rate players are slamming into each other a half second late, they’ve got to be coming.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

23’: Pavard Pushing

Benjamin Pavard pushes forward and forces a corner for France. Griezmann sends it in, but it’s cleared readily.

19’: Pogba Sends One Sailing

France puts together some good passing in the Uruguay half, but when Paul Pogba gets the ball he launches a shot from 35 yards that sails far over.

Kevin Draper: Uruguay’s defense took seriously how badly Kylian Mbappé pillaged Argentina’s defense in the last game, or perhaps Uruguay’s defense is just better (probably both). Either way, they haven’t allowed him to get behind them or make any marauding runs. France’s attack has mostly been crosses into the box.

15’: France Counters

On the other end, Olivier Giroud heads a ball across the goal to Kylian Mbappé, but he can only loop his header over goal. It probably didn’t have enough power to trouble Fernando Muslera anyway.

15’: Uruguay Threatens on Corner

Lucas Torreira takes a corner for Uruguay, and Gimenez gets off a decent header, perhaps lacking pace. Hugo Lloris dives and punches it away.

11’: Free Kick for France

After some rolling around by France, Antoine Griezmann gets a free kick lofts one in; Varane gets a head on it but it goes wide.

8’: Giroud Up Front

France gets the ball in to Giroud in front of goal, but he gets only the barest of toes on it. Giroud is playing all by himself up front in the dead center.

Photo

6’: Uruguay Advances

Uruguay advances, and Stuani shoots a cross right past goal, but there’s no one there! Agonizing for Uruguay, which may have to fight for chances in this game.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Kevin Draper: Uruguay is a stout defensive team and missing one of their strikers, and so the conventional wisdom says they would bunker down and turn this game into a slog. But they have already gotten in behind France’s defense twice, and their attack isn’t as Luis Suarez-focused as you might expect.

4’: Chance for Uruguay

Four minutes in, the first good chance of the match goes to Uruguay, after France flubs a ball in the midfield.

Giroud Down

As Olivier Giroud writhes on the ground, a reminder: If you think Neymar is the only player who oversells his flops, keep a close eye on Luis Suarez today.

Kickoff!

Uruguay in sky blue, France in white. Edinson Cavani is on the bench, but he could be used as a sub for Uruguay.

Those Anthems

It’s the World Cup of soccer, but in a way it’s also the World Cup of national anthems, as the patriotic tunes get a workout before every game. You all have your favorites, but I vote for 1.

‘Hope Is a Powerful Weapon’

Writing to his wife Winnie nearly seven years into his imprisonment, Mandela shares his thoughts on the power of positive thinking.

“The Power of Positive Thinking” and “The Results of Positive Thinking” both written by the American psychologist Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, may be rewarding to read. The municipal library should stock them. I attach no importance to the metaphysical aspects of his arguments, but I consider his views on physical and psychological issues valuable. He makes the basic point that it is not so much the disability one suffers from that matters but one’s attitude to it. The man who says: I will conquer this illness and live a happy life, is already halfway through to victory.

… Remember that hope is a powerful weapon even when all else is lost. You and I, however, have gained much over the years and are making advances in important respects. You are in my thoughts every moment of my life. Nothing will happen to you darling. You will certainly recover and rise.

‘The World for Which I Am Fighting’

In 1969, Mr. Mandela was not permitted to attend the funeral of his son Thembi, who had died in a car accident. In this letter to Adelaide Sam Mase, the sister-in-law of his first wife, Evelyn Mandela, he reflects on the loss of his son, and on his reading of Christian scriptures, during which he refers to St. Paul as a “perfect pest” who would not quit in his persistence and mission.

Thembi’s death was a painful experience to all of us. This was particularly so for me, especially when one takes into account the fact that I had not seen him for 5 years, and that my application for permission to attend the funeral was not granted. I will never forget Thembi.

… I read the fresh and meaningful passages from the scriptures to which Mqwati kindly referred me. …[T]he importance of the passages quoted by him lies in the fact that they tell us of a way of life which would have brought us peace and harmony many centuries ago, if mankind had fully accepted and faithfully practiced the teachings they contain. They visualize a new world where there will be no wars, where famine, disease and racial intolerance will be no more, precisely the world for which I am fighting …",Opinion | ‘Hope Is a Powerful Weapon’: Unpublished Mandela Prison Letters,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/opinion/sunday/nelson-mandela-unpublished-prison-letters-excerpts.html

That’s an interesting question. Overcoming one’s fears is serious business and, while I am not an expert, I believe wholeheartedly in a quotation that has been attributed to the poet Robert Frost: “The only way out is through.” In other words, to get out of or resolve a painful situation, you have to confront the pain, while taking steps to alleviate it.

Not knowing an answer isn’t a failure. It’s not a reflection on who you are. I’m sure you’re a fine person. And not being able to complete a puzzle doesn’t mean you failed.

632,632,2017-10-05,www.nytimes.com,"Since taking office last year, President Trump has made eliminating federal regulations a priority. His administration, with help from Republicans in Congress, has often targeted environmental rules it sees as overly burdensome to the fossil fuel industry, including major Obama-era policies aimed at fighting climate change.

To date, the Trump administration has sought to reverse more than 70 environmental rules, according to a New York Times analysis, based on research from Harvard Law School’s Environmental Regulation Rollback Tracker, Columbia Law School’s Climate Tracker and other sources.

46 30 76 rules overturned rollbacks in process total rollbacks Air pollution and emissions 6 overturned 12 in process 18 total Drilling and extraction 11 overturned 6 in process 17 total Infrastructure and planning 11 overturned 1 in process 12 total Animals 8 overturned 1 in process 9 total Toxic substances and safety 4 overturned 3 in process 7 total Water pollution 3 overturned 3 in process 6 total Other 3 overturned 4 in process 7 total

The Environmental Protection Agency has been involved in more than a third of the policy reversals identified by The Times. Scott Pruitt, the head of the E.P.A. who spearheaded the administration’s agenda of environmental deregulation, resigned after facing a number of ethics scandals. Andrew Wheeler, the new acting chief of the agency, is a former coal lobbyist who also wants to roll back environmental regulations.

Rules targeted for reversal so far include key Obama-era efforts to curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, as well as broader air and water pollution controls and protections for threatened animals and habitats. The Trump administration has, in many instances, pared back these regulations in favor of more expansive energy extraction policies — often as a direct response to petitions from oil, gas and coal companies. Mr. Trump has argued that supporting the fossil fuel industry strengthens the economy.

The list above represents two types of policy changes: rules that have been officially reversed and those still in progress. Other rules, summarized at the bottom of this page, were undone but later reinstated after legal challenges.

The process of rolling back regulations has not always been smooth, in part because the administration has in some cases skipped steps like notifying the public and asking for comment. In several cases, courts have been asked to intervene to get agencies to follow their own policies.

All told, the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks could lead to at least 80,000 extra deaths per decade and cause respiratory problems for more than one million people, according to a recent analysis conducted by researchers from Harvard University. That number, however, is likely to be “a major underestimate of the global public health impact,” said Francesca Dominici, a professor of biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health.

But unlike Mr. Pruitt — who had come to Washington as an outsider and aspiring politician, only to get caught up in a swirl of controversy over his costly first-class travel and security spending — Mr. Wheeler is viewed as a consummate Washington insider who avoids the limelight and has spent years effectively navigating the rules.

For that reason, Mr. Wheeler’s friends and critics alike say, he could ultimately prove to be more adept than his controversial former boss in the job.

How safe will your building be in an earthquake? A bill in the California Legislature, AB 2681, would require cities to create inventories of potentially vulnerable buildings. It has passed through seven committees and is now in the Senate Appropriations Committee, where it faces uncertain passage for budget reasons. The bill would create extra work — and costs — for local municipal building departments.

Assemblymen Adrin Nazarian, who introduced the bill, says the cost of identifying weak buildings is worth it.

“When the ground starts shaking, you can either pray your building is safe or know your building is seismically safe,” Mr. Nazarian said by email.

636,636,2018-07-06,www.nytimes.com,"Workers will find the modest increase in hourly earnings — which falls a nose behind some measures of inflation — disappointing. But it does undercut the argument that the economy may be revving too fast.

The combination of middling pay raises and a bump up in the jobless rate should “take a little bit of pressure off the Federal Reserve to step up the pace of tightening,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist of High Frequency Economics, referring to the central bank’s debate over how quickly to raise benchmark interest rates.

Over the past three months, monthly payroll gains have averaged 211,000, and hiring has been running ahead of growth in the labor force. “There’s a gap there,” Mr. Sullivan noted, and without a steep and persistent plunge in hiring, “the unemployment rate is going to keep falling.”

The June report caps a string of encouraging economic reports. Many estimates for growth in the second quarter are bouncing above 4 percent. The manufacturing sector buzzed with activity last month, and spending on construction rose. New jobless claims are dragging along at historically low levels. And many consumers displayed their confidence in the economy by kicking off the summer with a new car purchase.

Anxieties over a harmful trade war, however, continue to cast shadows as $34 billion in additional tariffs on China went into effect on Friday, and the Chinese said they would retaliate. “They’re playing with fire, really,” Mr. O’Sullivan said of the Trump administration’s trade policies. The jobs report over all was very encouraging, he said, though “we could do with a scare in these numbers to force trade negotiations along.”

Hiring in the manufacturing sector nonetheless continued its surge, with 36,000 jobs added in June. Business and professional services as well as health care also had strong showings, while the retail sector slumped, losing 22,000 jobs.

The latest surveys of business owners around the country have been full of comments expressing dismay with the uncertainty generated by tariffs, whether newly imposed or threatened.

Last week, General Motors said that tariffs could lead to “less investment, fewer jobs and lower wages.” The motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson, based in Wisconsin, announced it would shift some production overseas to sidestep retaliatory tariffs imposed by European countries.

The United States Chamber of Commerce, warning that escalating tariffs would result in “lost sales and ultimately lost jobs here at home,” published a state-by-state breakdown this week showing exports that could be harmed along with estimates of the number of jobs that depend on global trade.

And on Thursday, the minutes from last month’s meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers were released. “Most participants noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified,” the Fed said, and it was “concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending.”

Chasing Higher Wages

As the jobless rate falls, employers’ complaints about their inability to find qualified, reliable workers mount.

“There’s more jobs than there are people available for jobs — at every level,” said Joe Galvin, chief research officer of Vistage, an association of small-business owners and executives. In a Vistage survey last month, an overwhelming share of employers spoke of their frustration in finding people to fill openings on the factory floor and in the executive suite, Mr. Galvin said.

To retain workers as well as attract new ones, employers say they are increasing pay, sweetening benefits packages and trying to create an appealing work culture.

Yet as the jobs report shows, average pay raises have been relatively measly considering the demand for labor. Workers, particularly in lower-wage sectors, have other complaints. Many employers limit hours to avoid paying benefits like health insurance. Work shifts frequently change with little notice, and wage increases are still insufficient to cover living costs. Stability and security are often scarce.

Child care, for instance, is an industry known for high turnover rates, low pay and a predominance of female workers.

“We are always looking for job candidates,” said Gigi Schweikert, president and chief operating officer of Lightbridge Academy, which operates child care facilities. “While many industries can move toward automation,” she said, “you can’t in caring for young children.”

The company is moving toward a $15-an-hour minimum over three years, Ms. Schweikert said. “We want to be more aggressive, but we can’t price parents out of the market,” she said. “We can only increase that parent tuition to a point where parents can afford it.”

Higher-wage earners are also in demand. DocuSign, an electronic-signature company with more than $500 million in annual revenue, added 100 sales, engineering and technical workers last month and intended to hire another 500 over the next six months, said Joan Burke, the company’s chief people officer.

“You just cannot be in this game without being competitive,” Ms. Burke said of salaries.

For most workers, the biggest pay gains are accompanied by a job change.

Andrew Chamberlain, the chief economist at Glassdoor, a jobs listing website, said he had noticed a weakening in the retail sector. “There’s been a precipitous decline in postings on Glassdoor in the past two months,” he said. (Most job losses from the demise of Toys “R” Us will probably show up in July.)

Still, announced job cuts in the sector have slowed substantially in the second quarter compared with the first, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement service.

Looking Ahead

Heightening trade tensions are not the only risks.

Mr. Chamberlain, like most other economists, warns that the economic high has been pumped up in part by deep tax cuts financed by ballooning debt. “We are in a miniboom being fueled by a tax stimulus in 2018 that’s not going to last,” he said.

Oxford Economics, an economic research firm, noted in its newsletter that with sluggish wage increases, consumers over the past couple of years had dipped into savings to finance spending. That habit can be particularly risky for lower-income families who could be easily knocked off course by a surge in energy prices or a large unexpected medical bill.",U.S. Hiring Stayed Strong in June Despite Trade Strains,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/business/economy/jobs-report.html

Among them was a suite of historic regulations aimed at mitigating global warming pollution from the United States’ vehicles and power plants.

[Mr. Wheeler shares Mr. Pruitt’s zeal to dismantle climate change regulations. Read more here.]

Mr. Pruitt also played a lead role in urging Mr. Trump to follow through on his campaign pledge to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, despite warnings from some of the president’s other senior advisers that the move could damage the United States’ credibility in foreign policy. Under the landmark accord, nearly every country had committed to reducing emissions of planet-warming fossil fuel pollution.

In 2017, Mr. Pruitt made headlines for questioning the established science of human-caused climate change, contradicting decades of research by scientific institutions, including his own agency. Although Mr. Pruitt was harshly criticized for the remarks, they did not affect his good standing with a president who has also mocked climate science.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly told associates that Mr. Pruitt has done what he has wanted in terms of cutting regulations, so he has been reluctant to let him go. Mr. Pruitt, for his part, had made himself available to the president as a confidant.

When did you join Magnum?

I had a very small assignment from Harper’s to photograph women at the 1976 Democratic convention. If you’re major media, you get a pass, or multiple passes, and you can move freely. But if you’re a small international or national publication, you only get a rotating pass for 15 minutes. You barely can get on the floor and do any work before you have to give up that pass.

I was agonizing because it was one of my first assignments and I was failing. I just couldn’t make the photographs I was hoping to because of the system. I went up to the guy running this and said: “Look, this isn’t working for all of us on the line and we’ve got to change the system. Even if we only had a half-hour we could produce something.” Gilles Peres happened to be near and asked if I wanted to borrow one of the passes he had. I said, “No, I want to change the system.” So he loved that.

I wasn’t on the path of becoming a professional photographer. I didn’t really have at the time a sense of Magnum, its history or what it would mean to join a cooperative. He asked me what I was doing and I had this portfolio of work that I brought up to Magnum and they asked if they could propose me in their upcoming meeting.

642,642,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"For the Fed, the nearest parallel may be an oil price shock caused by some geopolitical event, such as those that took place in the 1970s, or a food price spike caused by a drought. What those events have in common is that they are caused not by economic fundamentals — such as when oil prices rise because the global economy is booming — but by some external shock. They are bad for growth, yet inflationary.

In those cases, monetary policy orthodoxy tends to emphasize looking past a one-time bump in inflation caused by the shock, while paying more attention to whether higher prices — whether for oil or corn or aluminum — are leading people to expect continually rising prices. A couple of years ago, with the Fed struggling to achieve the 2 percent inflation level it targets and with prices consistently rising more slowly, that might have been welcome.

Now, though, the Fed is pretty much achieving its inflation goal already, and with the unemployment rate at a very low level by historical standards, there’s reason to think higher prices may be on the way soon even before the impact of tariffs. In projections released at the mid-June policy meeting, the median Fed official expected that inflation would be 2.1 percent this year and next.

That calculus could change if a trade war starts doing major damage to the financial system, such as by causing steep losses in stock and bond markets or by causing financial stress for banks. But while the stock market is down a bit in recent weeks as the war of words over trade has escalated, so far the pain from trade wars has been limited to specific companies and their workers and customers. It has not been a systemic crisis.

For the last 11 years, from the housing downturn in 2007 that turned into the global financial crisis in 2008 and a prolonged, sluggish expansion after that, the Fed’s tools were reasonably well suited to the challenges that presented themselves. The central bank became even more central than usual to every economic discussion.

In May, eight months after the death of Maxwell Gruver, a freshman pledge at the university’s now banished Phi Delta Theta fraternity chapter, Gov.

Last month, I reported on the planned wedding of two X-Men, which did not occur, a day before the comic (a terrific issue) came out. There was no noticeable reaction to that spoiler, which definitely would have informed my thinking on this story.

Let’s talk about the headline

I understand that you had no malicious intention with your article but was including the spoiler in the headline necessary?

— Ashly Lopez

Why wasn’t there a warning? I’m sure I wasn’t the only one roped in by the title. You couldn’t have thought what this means to so many people. I was heartbroken.

— Raven Rodarte, San Mateo, Calif.

LeAnn Wilcox, Weddings editor: There truly was no malicious intent. And, in fact, after DC agreed to running the article ahead of the publication date, I can honestly say the spoiler effect did not occur to us. It should have. If we had a do-over, we would have included a spoiler alert at the top of the article, and we would have had a less direct headline, but also an honest headline.

Timing of publication

Could you release something like this perhaps the day OF release or the Sunday after?

Also, don’t do it in the Styles section. It’s comics, which is literature despite what some might think.

— Daniel Kalban, Brooklyn, N.Y.

George Gene Gustines, Comics writer: In addition to making room for spoiler warnings, I will weigh even more seriously the right timing in the future, Daniel. Would publishing on Wednesday morning have mitigated some of the intense reactions? What time on Wednesday would have given the most fans a chance to read the book for themselves? Would publishing on Thursday or the following Sunday have had the same resonance? I will factor that all in the next time something major happens to an iconic character and I have the opportunity to cover it.

I don’t think that having this article appear in Style s besmirches comics in any way. A feature in the Vows section seemed like a creative place to cover this story, but my articles frequently appear in our daily Arts section, our Business pages, our Metropolitan section and, every so often, in Sports.

It was the year that Facebook and then Apple began offering egg freezing as a benefit to employees. Hundreds of think pieces followed, debating the costs and benefits of “postponing procreation” in the name of professional advancement.

In the years since, many more women across the world have frozen their eggs . Many are highly educated. But the decision may have very little to do with work, at least according to a new study. In interviews with 150 American and Israeli women who had undergone one cycle, career planning came up as the primary factor exactly two times.

Instead, most women focused on another reason: they still hadn’t found a man to build a family with.

“The stereotype that these ambitious career women are freezing their eggs for the purposes of their career — that’s really inaccurate at the present time,” said Marcia Inhorn, a medical anthropologist from Yale University, and one of the authors of the study, which was presented Monday at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology’s conference in Spain.",Lots of Successful Women Are Freezing Their Eggs.

China’s state-controlled news media echoed the sentiment.

“As the American side has gradually closed in on China, it has aroused the ire of Chinese society, and made Chinese people more clearheaded, more united,” said an editorial on the website of Global Times, a nationalist tabloid owned by the Communist Party. “Washington has obviously underestimated the giant force that the world’s opposition and China’s retaliation can produce.”

But Chinese news outlets have stopped short of language that would suggest appetite for a major escalation, such as a consumer boycott of American brands.

China has become a key market for brands such as Apple, Nike, Starbucks and General Motors. Consumer boycotts have proven effective in Beijing’s earlier disputes with South Korea, Japan and the Philippines. But targeting American goods could be trickier. The iPhones, Chevrolets and other goods that American companies sell in China are often made in China, and by Chinese workers.

Still, some consumers said they could imagine making do without iPhones or American cars as a way to strike back against Washington.","China Strikes Back at Trump’s Tariffs, but Its Consumers Worry",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/business/china-trump-trade-war-tariffs.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer
650,650,2018-06-26,www.nytimes.com,"32D: Hand up if you, like me, thought this was a math question. Not today. We’re supposed to be thinking about the three dots that make up a written ellipsis, like so ( … ). One-third of an ellipsis would be a single DOT.

Today’s Theme

Inspired by a line from the film “The Social Network,” Mr. White has taken the advice given to Mark Zuckerberg to heart: In one scene, Mr. Zuckerberg wants to call his new website “The Facebook,” whereupon an adviser tells him to DROP THE ‘THE.’

Mr. White takes four familiar base phrases that all contain the word “the,” DROPs THE ‘THE,’ and clues them in that new and punny way. I liked these, although at least one may depend not only on getting the theme, but one’s background or age as well. For example, at 17A, the clue “Early ‘Saturday Night Live’ camera command?” takes the THE out of CUT TO THE CHASE to get CUT TO CHASE. That’s very funny, as long as you know that the actor Chevy Chase was one of the breakout stars of the first season of SNL in 1975. At 24A, it helps to know that POP means soda (this was something I first learned when I went away to college in a different area than where I grew up), which is why the entry POP QUESTION refers to Coke and Pepsi.

Constructor Notes

I could have sworn that Sean Parker, in the film “The Social Network,” advised Mark Zuckerberg to LOSE THE THE, and so it was with my original submission. But the editors (who accepted the puzzle conditionally) and checking crew knew better, advised me as such, and in pretty quick time I lost the LOSE and dropped in the DROP — which in fact improved the fill. Good thing they’re both 4 letters long. I’m a fan of Chevy Chase and Kevin Bacon, and also a part-time physics nut, so three of the four theme entries felt in my wheelhouse. “What’s matter?” is an enormous question, and still eludes me. And the revealer? Jesse Eisenberg (who played Zuckerberg) is flat-out brilliant as an actor, author, and humorist for The New Yorker, so it was with pleasure I could obliquely tip my hat his way.

Silver, mind you, hasn’t signaled that he’s seriously in favor of changing the format anyway. Not without a much more balanced regular-season schedule.

My long-held dream of a completely balanced schedule, using the Premier League soccer model in which every N.B.A. team would play the other 29 teams twice each — home and home — is a complete no-hoper. That would take the regular-season schedule down to 58 games from 82. Zero owners out of 30 would forfeit 12 home dates per season and their corresponding revenue. It will never, ever happen.

Nor will a switch to playing three games every season against every other team. That would stretch the 82-game season to 87 — after the N.B.A. just moved up the start of the regular season by a week, shortened its preseason schedule considerably and extended the All-Star break to reduce schedule congestion.

If a smoother formula emerges for a more balanced schedule that positions each team to play the same number of regular-season games against East and West teams, expect Silver to consider it. He has made it clear in recent news conferences that he is not wedded to the 82-game schedule, in place since the 1967-68 season. He hasn’t been a “that’s the way we’ve always done it” kind of commissioner.

“The obstacle is travel — and it’s not tradition in my mind at least,” Silver said in February.

Player health and wellness, remember, have been top priorities during Silver’s four years in charge. Any change to the playoff system would have to work in concert with the various initiatives he has already enacted in hopes of giving players more windows for sleep, more protections against fatigue and more insulation from the time-zone switches that wreak havoc on body clocks.

Something else to consider: The East, at least in the regular season, has been far more competitive against the West lately than anyone seems willing to acknowledge. Over the past three seasons, Eastern Conference teams were 24, 42 and 14 games under .500 in head-to-head games against the West.

The discrepancy was 118 games under .500 for the East as recently as the 2013-14 season. Going back further, that same gap was 98 (2000-1), 80 (2002-3) and 112 (2003-4) in three of the first four seasons in the 2000s.","Finally Free From LeBron’s Reign, the N.B.A. East Has No Reason to Change",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/sports/basketball/stein-nba-playoff-seeding.html

654,654,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"When organizations like the Chamber of Commerce or the Heritage Foundation declare that Trump’s tariffs are a bad idea, they are on solid intellectual ground: All, and I mean all, economic experts agree. But they don’t have any credibility, because these same conservative institutions have spent decades making war on expertise.

The most obvious case is climate change, where conservative organizations, very much including the chamber, have long acted as “merchants of doubt,” manufacturing skepticism and blocking action in the face of overwhelming scientific consensus. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s hard to pivot from “pay no attention to those so-called experts who say the planet is warming” to “protectionism is bad — all the experts agree.”

Similarly, organizations like Heritage have long promoted supply-side economics, a.k.a., voodoo economics — the claim that tax cuts will produce huge growth and pay for themselves — even though no economic experts agree. So they’ve already accepted the principle that it’s O.K. to talk economic nonsense if it’s politically convenient. Now comes Trump with different nonsense, saying “trade wars are good, and easy to win.” How can they convince anyone that his nonsense is bad, while theirs was good?

But a trade war may be only the start of big business’s self-inflicted punishment. Much worse and scarier things may lie ahead, because Trump isn’t just a protectionist, he’s an authoritarian. Trade wars are nasty; unchecked power is much worse, and not just for those who are poor and powerless.

Consider the fact that Trump is already in the habit of threatening businesses that have crossed him. After Harley-Davidson announced that it was shifting some production overseas because of trade conflicts, he warned that the company would be “taxed like never before” — which certainly sounds as if he wants to politicize the I.R.S. and use it to punish individual businesses.

For the moment, he probably can’t do anything like that. But suppose Republicans retain control of Congress this November. If they do, does anyone think they’ll stand up against abuses of presidential power? G.O.P. victory in the midterms would put a lot of people and institutions at the mercy of Trump’s authoritarian instincts, big business very much included.

But organizations like the chamber and Heritage are still trying to ensure a Republican victory. In fact, until its recent shift in focus to protectionism, the chamber was running ads trying (unsuccessfully, it’s true, but still) to build public support for the Trump tax cut in competitive House districts. Compare this with those free-trade ads, which serve no clear political purpose.

The point is that it’s not just world trade that’s at risk, but the rule of law. And it’s at risk in part because big businesses abandoned all principle in the pursuit of tax cuts.",Opinion | Big Business Reaps Trump’s Whirlwind,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/opinion/trade-war-trump-business-jobs.html

The lawmaker, Representative Janelle Bynum, who is the only black member of the Oregon House of Representatives, said that after canvassing more than two dozen homes in the Clackamas neighborhood on Tuesday, she was taking notes near a driveway around 5 p.m. when a deputy with the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office arrived.

Representative Celler had arrived in Congress with the backing of Tammany Hall, during the presidency of Warren G. Harding — in 1923 — and now, half a century later, he had the support of the powerful Brooklyn party boss Meade Esposito, whose celebrity in the borough was such that a veal dish bearing his name appeared on the menu of a popular restaurant on Montague Street near the Brooklyn courthouses, which were filled with the judges he had essentially placed. This omnipotence was to have insulated Mr. Celler from his own irrelevance. He kept such a distance from his constituents that he did not even maintain an office in the district, which encompassed largely white middle-class Flatbush, Midwood and Marine Park as well as parts of poor African-American neighborhoods in central Brooklyn. He was 84, and he was cranky.

Of his two opponents, he concerned himself with only one, a 30-year-old Harvard Law School graduate, Elizabeth Holtzman, a reform candidate who had been active in the civil rights movement and served as mayoral aide to John V. Lindsay. “Her fulminations are as useless, as we say, as a wine cellar without a corkscrew,” Mr. Celler told The Times, proceeding to call her campaign statements “irrational” and her persona, more generally, “as irritating as a hangnail.”

Like Representative Joseph Crowley, the longtime incumbent who lost New York’s 14th Congressional District seat last month, blind to the force of a young, female challenger, Mr. Celler didn’t see what was coming.

It was during these moments that our real bonding took place. We challenged strongly held perceptions, released ideas that felt accurate but did not represent the only truth. Using a combination of logic and flexibility, together we arrived at places that once seemed impossible.

I much preferred puzzling to watching my son pack up his countless possessions: camping equipment, snowboard gear, carabiners and ropes. Calculus books in one pile, Calvin and Hobbes in another. It all reminded me of that teary car ride years ago, after first dropping him at college. I didn’t cry because I missed him — he hadn’t been gone long enough for that — but because I thought I’d done such a flawed job raising him. Like me, he ate much too fast and could barely fold a T-shirt. I remember thinking, “If I just had more time.” As if time could solve what I truly was stuck on.

Our first children teach us to parent; they teach us the lessons we need to learn in order to let go. A few years ago, Noah reminded me what a poor student I’d been. A trivial argument about cellphone data escalated quickly into one of our biggest fights. “You’re always looking for what’s wrong with everything,” he finally shrieked, eyes unforgiving. His words hung sharply between us, revealing a clue I’d been missing for years.

What he was saying was true, and it wasn’t about gigabytes. As a mother, I’d learned to relax about many things, but maybe not the right things. I’d complain that roller coasters were too fast and body surfing was too wet. Even sashimi felt a little too wild for me. He was telling me I had failed him by not stepping fearlessly into his world. Or maybe more to the point: by not stepping fearlessly aside.

Noah and I crushed a few puzzles that week and then said goodbye. He drove off on a Monday and I expected each day to feel harder, in the same way the puzzle gets tougher over the week. But having Noah gone was easier than I thought it would be, a house filled with less smelly laundry, fewer cluttering shoes, more food in the fridge, and an unquantifiable amount of calm.",The Language of Letting Go,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/crosswords/the-language-of-letting-go.html
667,667,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"On Thursday, President Trump showed no signs of backing down from his fight, saying aboard Air Force One that the first wave of tariffs on $34 billion in goods would quickly be followed by levies on another $16 billion of Chinese products. And Mr. Trump continued to threaten Beijing with escalating tariffs on as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods.

For now, it is unclear how — or whether — the trade war might conclude. Mr. Trump’s threats have been met with vows from China to retaliate, a stalemate that will require one side to blink first in order to avoid a protracted fight. With no official talks scheduled between the two countries, and disagreements within the Trump administration about how best to proceed, a quick resolution seems increasingly unlikely.

“At the moment, I don’t see how this ends,” said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “This is very much in the president’s hands because he’s got advisers that seem divided, some substantively, some tactically. I just don’t think we’ve had any clear signs of the resolution he wants.”

The Trump administration is waging trade wars on multiple fronts as it imposes tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum, solar panels and washing machines from countries like Canada, Mexico, the European Union and Japan. Yet the tariffs on China, the world’s largest manufacturing hub, affect a much larger share of products and a greater percentage of companies that rely on global supply chains, potentially hurting American companies even more than the Chinese firms the Trump administration is targeting.

Mr. Trump’s aggressive stance toward China is aimed at pressuring the country to curtail what the White House describes as a pattern of unfair trade practices and theft of American intellectual property. In addition to the tariffs, the White House is placing restrictions on investment and on visas for Chinese nationals. The administration says the trade barriers are being used as leverage to force Beijing to make changes, including opening its markets to American companies and ending its practice of requiring firms operating in China to hand over valuable technology.",Trump’s Trade War With China Is Officially Underway,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/business/china-us-trade-war-trump-tariffs.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer
668,668,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"Washington State has a program to reimburse ranchers for wolf depredations. But not every death is compensated. And ranchers are proud: Some won’t take the dollars. “I don’t raise my animals to get ate,” as one horse rancher put it. They would rather address the problem at its source. In Washington’s wolf country, it’s not unheard-of for a county’s leaders to authorize the sheriff to usurp state authority and kill wolves if needed or for a billboard to appear in Spokane bearing demonic yellow eyes above a laughing little girl and the question, “Who’s next on their menu?”

Agriculture and ranching are powerful in Washington State — agriculture is a $10.6 billion industry, and the state leads the nation in producing crops like apples, hops and blueberries. This means serious sway in the Legislature, which controls a chunk of funding for Washington State University, a land-grant university with a heavy focus on agriculture research. All of this can make for a complicated pas de deux between politicians and the university. This was the fraught world that Wielgus, the maverick academic, was thrust into.

Wielgus grew up hunting rabbits and poking around the woods that fringed the suburbs of Winnipeg, Manitoba. (He holds Canadian and American passports, and his voice still tilts upward pleasantly at the end of some sentences.) After college he took provincial jobs with wildlife agencies, studying moose, elk and caribou.

He first became interested in carnivores when he embarked on graduate school and received an offer to join a grizzly-bear research effort in Alberta. “The danger of grizzlies really turned my crank because I was an adrenaline junkie,” he told me that night at the bar in Republic (where the evening’s chief threat turned out to be a bartender who didn’t have Wielgus’s preferred whiskey). He got his doctorate studying grizzlies in western Canada and northern Idaho, then went to the Pyrenees for a year to help with bear recovery. In 1997, Wielgus took a job as an assistant professor at W.S.U. He started the Large Carnivore Conservation Laboratory and began to study mountain lions. Through their work, he and colleagues discovered something fascinating: Killing adult males actually increased cougar sightings and also the number of cattle and sheep killed by other mountain lions, as younger cougars showed up in the old cat’s territory. The studies later played a part in a decision not to expand the hunting of mountain lions in the state.

In 2012, the state asked Wielgus to calculate a population model for Washington’s wolf-recovery plan. Wielgus had never studied wolves before, but he had a successful ongoing collaboration with the state’s wildlife agency, and the job aligned well with the lab’s overall focus. The agency was pleased with the modeling work and came back with a much larger offer: to oversee a multimillion-dollar research project as part of wolves’ return to Washington. Funded by the state Legislature for at least four years, the work would try to get to the bottom of the age-old conflict between wolves and livestock.

For a carnivore scientist, it was a tremendous opportunity. Wielgus designed a study that would radio-collar hundreds of livestock and dozens of wolves. “It was the largest study of wolf-livestock interactions ever conducted on the planet,” he told me. In other places where wolves and livestock share the landscape, only about 20 percent of wolf packs ever attack sheep and cattle. But there wasn’t a lot of good information about what accounts for those attacks and therefore how they might be prevented. Tracking both predator and prey would help provide answers. Fewer dead cows would mean fewer wolves hunted down. And that could mean peace among the humans.

Once Wielgus got his first round of money to start the study, the associate dean for research at W.S.U.’s College of Agricultural, Human and Natural Resource Sciences asked Wielgus to come see him. At the meeting, according to Wielgus, the dean reminded him that his work would be controversial and unpopular with some politicians. Then, Wielgus said, the dean drew a box in the air between the men, and added, “If you step outside of this box, then basically your job is over.”",Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf Scientist?,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/magazine/whos-afraid-of-the-big-bad-wolf-scientist.html

670,670,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"The novelist Anne Tyler, whose 22nd novel, “Clock Dance,” comes out July 10, has been around for so long, reliably turning out books of such consistently high quality, that it’s easy to take her a little for granted. Oddballs, misfits, sad sacks, melancholy, messed-up families — by now we know, or think we know, exactly what we’re going to get. Nor has Tyler made much of an effort to publicize herself. She doesn’t do book tours, almost never gives interviews. She doesn’t need to. She has a Pulitzer Prize, a National Book Critics Circle Award and legions of satisfied fans, among them writers like Jodi Picoult, Emma Donoghue, Nick Hornby. John Updike, another admirer, once said that she wasn’t just good but “wickedly good.”

Tyler is not a recluse, exactly — or, as one critic called her, the Greta Garbo of the literary world — but she’s a creature of rigorous habit, rooted in Baltimore, her home for the last 51 years and one she seldom leaves. She doesn’t do interviews, because she dislikes the way they make her feel the next morning. “I’ll go upstairs to my writing room to do my regular stint of work,” she said recently, “and I’ll probably hear myself blathering on about writing and I won’t do a very good job that day. I always say that the way you write a novel is for the first 83 drafts you pretend that nobody is ever, ever going to read it.”

So why was she sitting in front of a voice recorder now? “I don’t know.” She laughed. “Maybe because I’m getting old and easier to push around.”

For the last 10 years, since her husband died and her children moved away, Tyler, who is 75 now but looks much younger, has lived in a high-end Rouse development on the edge of Baltimore’s leafy Roland Park neighborhood. Furnished in contemporary Shaker style, with lots of polished wood, her house is almost disturbingly neat. Her upstairs writing room is so uncluttered and antiseptic you could safely perform surgery there, and what actually takes place at her desk is only a little less complicated. She writes in longhand, draft after draft, and when she has a section she’s satisfied with, types it into a computer. When she has a completed draft she prints it out and then rewrites it all in longhand again, and that version she reads out loud into a Dictaphone. The result is a style that she modestly calls no style at all, but is nevertheless unmistakably hers: transparent and alert to all the nuances of the seemingly ordinary.","Attention, Please: Anne Tyler Has Something to Say",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/books/anne-tyler-clock-dance.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer
671,671,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"Today, little visual evidence remains of the Underground Railroad, an antebellum network of secret routes and safe houses, maintained by brave black and white “conductors,” which facilitated the escape of slaves to free states and Canada. For Mr. Bey, whose work has often focused on urban environments, the challenge was to create images that evoke the history of largely rural areas. While he photographed sites in Cleveland, he sometimes found the city’s urban character inconsistent with the historical past. His research led him to the more rustic town of Hudson, Ohio, 30 miles southeast of the city, with areas of landscape that are little changed from the years before the Civil War and where several Underground Railroad stations remain.

“I wanted the photographs to almost involuntarily pull you back to the experience of the landscape through which those fugitive black bodies were moving in the 19th century to escape slavery,” Mr. Bey said. “So I had to learn, for the first time, how to make photographs in that kind of space.”

The photographs of “Night Coming Tenderly, Black” are among Mr. Bey’s most sensual and layered. In their splendor and mystery, they transform fields, bodies of water and houses shrouded in darkness into symbols of hope: a pristine picket fence and farmhouse seen through the haze of night; a marsh glistening in twilight; a forest thick with small trees, a scene that is at first claustrophobic then liberating when understood through the lens of history; and an image of Lake Erie, its expansive sky and horizon foreshadowing the independence that lies beyond.","Escaping to Freedom, in the Shadows of the Night",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/lens/escaping-to-freedom-in-the-shadows-of-the-night.html

She has cancer and has been on a ventilator, according to officials with Mr. Sharif’s political party, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz. His request that the verdict be delayed for at least one week was rejected by the judge earlier on Friday.

Members of the Sharif family had said before the verdict that they would appeal any convictions, but they are unlikely to get relief from the higher courts.

The conviction also bars Maryam Sharif from contesting the July 25 elections, in a blow to Mr. Sharif’s ambitions for his daughter to play a leading role in national and party politics. Ms. Sharif has emerged in recent months as a powerful voice for civilian rule and against the military’s interference in politics.

677,677,2018-07-04,www.nytimes.com,"If others rolled their eyes at Mr. Stanfield’s acting dreams, his mother believed in him and called him her superstar. Part of their connection was forged by pain. Mr. Stanfield said he would get involved when his mother and stepfather fought, and scream at him to leave her alone. When she could, she would drive him to Los Angeles for auditions. When she couldn’t, Mr. Stanfield tried to hustle up money for the train. And when there were no lawns to mow or cars to wash, he’d panhandle.

For a good while, nothing much happened in Los Angeles beyond a series of awkward auditions. Eventually, he was connected with Mr. Cretton, who cast him as a teenager living in a group home for his 21-minute master’s thesis project, “Short Term 12.” The film made waves at Sundance in 2009, and back at high school, Mr. Stanfield proudly handed out DVD copies. He told himself that even if he never got another Hollywood job, he’d be satisfied (he says he still keeps that attitude today, and that it’s been a ballast). And for a few years, it looked as if that would be it, because he couldn’t land another part. He worked at the marijuana place, and then briefly moved to Sacramento to live with his dad, where he sold AT&T contracts door to door until he got fired over outstanding marijuana warrants.

Around 2012, Mr. Cretton found the financing to make his short into a feature, and put new actors — among them Brie Larson and Rami Malek — in every role. But no one felt right for Mr. Stanfield’s old part. And Mr. Stanfield was nowhere to be found. He’d fired his manager, and dropped his old email and phone number. Mr. Cretton eventually tracked him down on a messaging board. Mr. Stanfield drove down with his mom from Victorville, riven with certainty. “Never was I more ready,” he said. He read through a few scenes in Mr. Cretton’s living room, and when he looked up, he saw Mr. Cretton was in tears.

The film debuted to raves, and Mr. Stanfield was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award. Yet for months afterward, he drifted about Los Angeles lucklessly, alternately sleeping in his car or on Mr. Cretton’s couch, as all of his auditions led to naught. Lying in his own bed, Mr. Cretton would silently send anguished prayers to the Hollywood gods, imploring them not to mess this one up. “Someone recognize this dude,” Mr. Cretton recalled pleading.

In acting lingo, he is wide open.

Hiro Murai, who has directed the majority of “Atlanta’s” episodes, said Mr. Stanfield was the most intuitive performer he’s worked with yet. “He sort of lets himself free-fall in the moment,” Mr. Murai wrote in an email. “He’s fearless that way.”",Lakeith Stanfield Is Playing Us All,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/04/movies/lakeith-stanfield-sorry-to-bother-you.html

Fewer young people wanted to work on dull and stressful assembly lines, preferring service jobs — like waiting tables and delivering e-commerce packages — that let them interact with people or move around. Some factories moved to lower-cost countries or shut down for good.

Dongguan’s companies and government had to do something. They committed to modernizing.

Before Made in China 2025 became policy, Dongguan kicked off a “replacing humans with machines initiative” and funded it with about $30 million a year. It later channeled more money into other automation initiatives. Companies that could prove they had a worthy research project or were willing to invest in industrial robots, software or advanced machinery could win subsidies and tax breaks. The government picked up 10 percent to 20 percent of the tab. Smartphone, furniture, machinery and even cake companies won support, official documents show.

Mentech, the telecom equipment supplier, once had hundreds of workers winding, packaging and testing magnetic wires that were thinner than hair, all by hand. Even today, the company is desperate for workers. On the side of one factory building it lists the on-the-job benefits it offers: monthly wages with overtime of up to about $1,100, air-conditioned dormitories, free Wi-Fi and even a birthday present.

“Love your employees,” reads a banner, “and they will love you back 100 times.”

But labor costs and a lack of hands were holding it back. During the Lunar New Year holiday, when most of China shuts down and goes home, some 500 Mentech executives, engineers and administrative staff had to work three-hour shifts after their normal workday to keep the factory running, said Zhang Xiaodong, a research and development manager.

Mentech asked Mr. Zhang and others to figure out how to automate the factory. They spent two years working late into the night. Machines needed tweaking. Components needed to be redesigned so that machines could make them. Several projects failed.

Rogers often comforted children on the show and taught them in simple terms, but the documentary shows how he did so with a profound respect for the dignity of each child that almost rises to veneration. You see his visceral disgust for shows that don’t show respect — that dump slime on children, that try to entertain them with manic violence.

In the gospel of Fred Rogers, children are our superiors in the way they trust each person they meet, the way they lack guile, the way a child can admit simple vulnerability.

At one point in the series, the tiger puppet who stood in for Rogers’s inner child sang, “Sometimes I wonder if I’m a mistake,” meaning, I am so different, am I a mistake? An adult character sang along and tried to reassure him that he was not a mistake, but he was not reassured. As Alice Lloyd reminds us in The Weekly Standard, “deep and simple is far more essential than shallow and complex” was a favorite maxim of Rogers.

Children are superior for their instinctive small acts of neighborliness, the small hug, sharing a toy. In 1997 a teenage boy in Kentucky warned classmates that “something big” was going to happen. The next day he took a gun to school and shot eight classmates, killing three. Mister Rogers’s response was, “Oh, wouldn’t the world be a different place if he had said, ‘I’m going to do something really little tomorrow.” Rogers dedicated a week’s worth of shows to the theme of “Little and Big” on how little things can be done with great care.

Rogers was drawing on a long moral tradition, that the last shall be first. It wasn’t just Donald Trump who reversed that morality, though he does represent a cartoonish version of the idea that winners are better than losers, the successful are better than the weak. That morality got reversed long before Trump came on the scene, by an achievement-oriented success culture, by a culture that swung too far from humble and earnest caritas.

683,683,2018-07-06,www.nytimes.com,"Still, there are limits to paper and pen. When Mr. Mandela’s son, Thembi, was killed in a car accident, Mr. Mandela was forbidden to attend the funeral. Prison stole from him the critical years in the lives of young daughters. In a letter written to his daughter Zenani shortly after her 12th birthday, he reminds her of a brief visit he had with her nearly a decade before, during the time when he had gone underground and was living away from home: “In a corner you found … my clothing. After collecting it, you gave it to me and asked me to go home. You held my hand for quite some time, pulling desperately and begging me to return. ”

Reading his anguished account, we understand another function of letters: to make memories tangible. He sought to remind his 12-year-old not only of his own love but also of the love that her heartbroken, 2-year-old self once felt for her vanished father. Winnie Mandela was briefly incarcerated while pregnant with Zenani, and Mr. Mandela reminded his daughter that she was the rare person who’d served jail time even before she was born.

Mr. Mandela’s letters tell a story beyond their own words. The printed volume includes several images of the pages. His handwriting is careful but crowded, as though trying to include more words than any page could hold. Perhaps he is saving rationed paper and ink, but he also seems to be tying a rope bridge of words to carry him from prison to the home where his wife and children await.

While these letters overflow their pages, there’s also a haunting sense of all that’s not expressed. Mr. Mandela wrote knowing his letters would be censored. He often asks about earlier missives, possibly intercepted or destroyed. On Aug. 1, 1970, he writes to Winnie: “Can it be that you did not receive my letter of July 1? How can I explain your strange silence at a time when contact between us has become so vital?”

He must also have known that these letters would one day be read by people all over the world. This loss of privacy is also a loss of the intimacy at the heart of our most sustaining relationships. He laments, “There are affairs in life where third parties, no matter who they are, should not be let in at all.” But he knew, too, how to sneak in a thousand unspoken words. To Winnie he writes, “I suspect that you intended the picture to convey a special message that no words could ever express. Rest assured that I have caught it.”",Opinion | What Nelson Mandela Lost,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/opinion/sunday/nelson-mandela-tayari-jones-prison-letters.html?hp&target=comments#commentsContainer

She joined The New York Times in 1979 but did not always feel welcome. A photo technician once slapped her when she expressed concern about the quality of a print, she said, and when she first started, the New York Press Photographers Association declined to grant her admission.

She became a culture photographer in 1994 and gradually overcame obstacles in the theater world, too, where producers were accustomed to controlling visual images of their shows by granting access only to photographers they hired.

Over time, she turned theater photography into a beat at the Times, becoming a mainstay on the arts pages while documenting more than a hundred plays and musicals each year. And on June 4 — six days before the Tony Awards air on television — she will be the first journalist recognized with a Tony Honor for Excellence in the Theater.

They were fleeing violence in Honduras in search of a better life. But it didn’t work out that way. Once they crossed the border, the United States charged him with a crime, and agents told him they had to take his daughter away.

As they were leaving, his daughter asked where she was going. What can a father possibly tell his daughter in that situation?

Like the character in “Life Is Beautiful,” this dad’s priority was to try to shield his little girl from pain. So he made up a story: He told her she was going to summer camp.

The girl, only 7 years old and oblivious to her plight, walked away with a big smile. She was so excited for her first day of camp.

Oddballs, misfits, sad sacks, melancholy, messed-up families — by now we know, or think we know, exactly what we’re going to get. Nor has Tyler made much of an effort to publicize herself. She doesn’t do book tours, almost never gives interviews. She doesn’t need to. She has a Pulitzer Prize, a National Book Critics Circle Award and legions of satisfied fans, among them writers like Jodi Picoult, Emma Donoghue, Nick Hornby. John Updike, another admirer, once said that she wasn’t just good but “wickedly good.”

Tyler is not a recluse, exactly — or, as one critic called her, the Greta Garbo of the literary world — but she’s a creature of rigorous habit, rooted in Baltimore, her home for the last 51 years and one she seldom leaves. She doesn’t do interviews, because she dislikes the way they make her feel the next morning. “I’ll go upstairs to my writing room to do my regular stint of work,” she said recently, “and I’ll probably hear myself blathering on about writing and I won’t do a very good job that day. I always say that the way you write a novel is for the first 83 drafts you pretend that nobody is ever, ever going to read it.”

So why was she sitting in front of a voice recorder now? “I don’t know.” She laughed. “Maybe because I’m getting old and easier to push around.”

For the last 10 years, since her husband died and her children moved away, Tyler, who is 75 now but looks much younger, has lived in a high-end Rouse development on the edge of Baltimore’s leafy Roland Park neighborhood. Furnished in contemporary Shaker style, with lots of polished wood, her house is almost disturbingly neat. Her upstairs writing room is so uncluttered and antiseptic you could safely perform surgery there, and what actually takes place at her desk is only a little less complicated. She writes in longhand, draft after draft, and when she has a section she’s satisfied with, types it into a computer. When she has a completed draft she prints it out and then rewrites it all in longhand again, and that version she reads out loud into a Dictaphone. The result is a style that she modestly calls no style at all, but is nevertheless unmistakably hers: transparent and alert to all the nuances of the seemingly ordinary.","Attention, Please: Anne Tyler Has Something to Say",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/books/anne-tyler-clock-dance.html
688,688,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"A bespoke suit, custom made, fitted and refitted, was an expensive, essentially conservative proposition, a suit of armor and the bedrock of a gentleman’s wardrobe, but distinctly not a fashionable item. A Savile Row suit “rarely looks new in the conventional sense,” the Australian journalist Lance Richardson writes in his new history of Tommy Nutter (and his brother, David), “House of Nutter.” Its magic, he goes on, “is that it enhances your real self into heightened fantasy, then presents this fantasy as your real self.”

Nutter brought a substantial dose of fantasy to the fantasy. He began on Savile Row at the lowest levels, picking up pins at G. Ward & Company, where he eventually joined forces with a talented young cutter named Edward Sexton and, with him, opened Nutters in 1969 — the first new tailor on Savile Row in more than a century. His investors included Peter Brown, a manager of the Beatles (he stepped in when his friend and former boss Brian Epstein died), and the pop star Cilla Black.

Image

Nutter was already a fixture on the London scene, well connected via Brown, his boyfriend for a time. The Nutters suit, unlike others on the Row, was cut for flash: tight-waisted and small-chested to emphasize the body, with a long jacket and mega lapels. Fabrics and colors were chosen to stand out rather than stand back. Men and women both flocked in: Bianca as well as Mick, Diana Ross, Eric Clapton, Twiggy, Peter Sellers. Elton John, who first came to Nutters in 1971, ordered in bulk.

“House of Nutter” traces the ascent and untimely end of Tommy Nutter, and the parallel history of his brother, David: also gay, also embedded in the world of rock ’n’ roll, though as a photographer and confidant. Tommy bloomed out of London’s Swinging Sixties and became an internationally recognized designer, a celebrity in his own right. He was as much a character as a person, natty and fabulous in a wild suit — “People expect one to turn up looking like a chic Bozo the Clown,” he once said — a salesman taking his show on the road.

689,689,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"Claude Lanzmann, the journalist and film director whose obsession with the Nazi genocide brought forth “Shoah,” a groundbreaking film that relived the annihilation of Jews through the memories of witnesses, died on Thursday in Paris. He was 92.

His publisher, Gallimard, confirmed his death, at the Saint-Antoine Hospital.

Mr. Lanzmann, a son of assimilated French Jews, took everything at full tilt. At 18, he led a Communist youth Resistance group, risking his life by smuggling small arms under the eyes of the Gestapo in Clermont-Ferrand, in central France. He became a figure of the intellectual Left, a protégé of Jean-Paul Sartre, the lover of Simone de Beauvoir for nine years, and a colleague of them both at the cultural review Les Temps Modernes, where he was editor in chief for many years.

With “Shoah” — Hebrew for catastrophe — Mr. Lanzmann upstaged everything he had done before. From its release in 1985, the film was internationally recognized as both an important historical record and an original, even beautiful, work of art — a nine-and-a-half-hour movie without a single frame of the by-then-familiar footage of the gas chambers or the living skeletons that Allied forces discovered in the Germans’ death camps.

Instead, Mr. Lanzmann tracked down and interviewed living witnesses: officers and bureaucrats who had run the camps; Jewish survivors, including veterans of the 1943 uprising in the Warsaw ghetto; and Polish townspeople in Treblinka, Chelmno and Oswiecim, where the Auschwitz camp was located.","Claude Lanzmann, Epic Chronicler of the Holocaust, Dies at 92",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/obituaries/claude-lanzmann-dead.html

691,691,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"About 80 percent of the asylum seekers detained on Nauru and Manus are ultimately found to be refugees. But with no prospect of ever being allowed into Australia, hundreds decide to return to their countries of origin. Australia has sought other locations for resettlement, including Cambodia and the United States. Canberra has so far refused offers by New Zealand to resettle refugees, arguing that this option would be too appealing to asylum seekers.

Almost no boats have arrived in Australia since 2014, though the Australian government has turned back an unknown number at sea. There are still some 225 people in detention on Nauru, and an estimated 515 in “transition centers” on Manus Island.

Some of Australia’s politicians openly defend the brutality of deterrence policies. For many years, they have preferred to talk about “people smugglers” rather than asylum seekers themselves. Forever banishing boat-borne asylum seekers from Australia, they say, destroys the business of those who carry refugees on dilapidated vessels for profit. The politicians warn that people smugglers are watching and waiting for a moment of weakness by Australia to resume operations. Last month, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton warned that “the hard-won success of the last few years could be undone overnight by a single act of compassion.”

Many people’s attitudes about asylum seekers changed in 2008. That year, the Labor Party government of Kevin Rudd closed the Pacific detention centers and began processing asylum seekers in Australia. This coincided with deteriorating humanitarian conditions in Sri Lanka and Afghanistan, and there was a surge in boat arrivals, resulting in many deaths at sea. Some progressives were finally convinced of the moral need for harsh policies.

A former Labor immigration minister, Tony Burke, describes how he kept the name of a 10-week-old boy who died at sea on his desk as a reminder of why he came to support policies to discourage people from getting on boats. Labor reinstated offshore processing in 2012, but lost an election the following year to the Liberals and Mr. Abbott, who pledged to “stop the boats.” The Australian Greens, a smaller progressive party, is the only one in Parliament that consistently opposes offshore processing.

The severe stances of the major parties are popular. A recent study found that about two-thirds of Australians support offshore processing, and growing numbers support measures to turn back intercepted boats at sea. While a quarter of the population say policies are too tough, higher numbers usually say policies are too soft. Some Australians see refugees from predominantly Muslim war-torn countries as national security threats, and believe they must be dealt with as harshly as possible. Many others resent those who arrive by boat as “queue-jumpers” who have unfairly circumvented Australia’s laws, unlike the “legitimate” refugees who wait for years in United Nations refugee camps.

Government statements and public opinion reinforce each other. Politicians justify draconian measures with appeals to Australians’ sense of fairness and safety, and in turn they face an electorate that they fear would punish them if they did otherwise.",Opinion | A Lesson in Demonizing Refugees,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/opinion/trump-australian-refugees.html

In Greenwich Village, she saw two duplexes on the penthouse level in the Cast Iron Building, circa 1868, on East 11th Street. Both had a private roof space and were going for around $1.3 million, with maintenance of $2,400. The price was just too high.

Sometimes the neighborhood was an immediate nonstarter. The Bowery was busy and loud. Long Island City suffered from the Long Island Rail Road’s throbbing diesel locomotives idling in the train yard. Some apartments had just a small balcony or a dark yard hemmed in by surrounding buildings.

Sergei Zheleznyak, deputy speaker of the lower house of Parliament, said that the British authorities might have concocted the case to sully Russia’s image while the country was hosting the World Cup soccer tournament.

“A huge number of British fans, despite the warnings from their government, came to support their team,” Mr. Zheleznyak told state television. “Their impressions are just destroying everything British propaganda built over the past few years.

Richard Guthrie, the coordinating editor of CBW Events, a website on chemical and biological weapons, said he would “put it in the 90-percent-plus likelihood that this was a discarded item,” like a coat with a container of the nerve agent in the pocket.

“You would want to dispose of the coat, of the gloves,” he said. “If it was good tradecraft, that would have been disposed of in a place that people wouldn’t think of it being disposed.” The couple might well have picked it up, spotting “a nice-looking jacket bundled up.”","English City, Stunned, Tries to Make Sense of New Poisonings",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/world/europe/uk-salisbury-russia-poisonings.html

Let America be America again. Let it be the dream it used to be. Let it be the pioneer on the plain Seeking a home where he himself is free. (America never was America to me.)



The parenthesis punctures the myth. The American idea is a journey toward a receding destination, driven by the pursuit of perfectibility. The nation was not born of a piece with the Constitution. Its contours were outlined, with sufficient clarity and flexibility to endure, for future generations to usher closer to an ideal of liberty and justice for all.



That is why for a black man, Hughes, writing 83 years ago, “America was never America.”

The poem continues:

O, let my land be a land where Liberty

Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath,

But opportunity is real, and life is free,

Equality is in the air we breathe.

(There’s never been equality for me,

Nor freedom in this “homeland of the free.”)

The tension in the poem derives from its absence of hatred. Hughes, despite the suffering he describes, believes in the unique potential of the United States for reinvention. He states flatly that he was unequal; he was not free. So racism dictated. Yet he dreams of an uplifting reconciliation between American reality and American dream.

For me, “sure” is the most beautiful American word. Not yes I’ll do it, or maybe, but sure I will. It’s forward-leaning and risk-embracing. It signals the space that Europe lacks. It captures America’s spirit.

Nowhere else is becoming somebody else so easy. There is space, still, to be free. Sure there is. The divisions between those who came first and those who came later are fungible.

Or so, on July 4, I want to believe. This will not be another American century. Old structures that worked are giving way to something as yet indiscernible, with its share of menace.

695,695,2018-07-06,www.nytimes.com,"Officials say the chief hurdle is complacency: In many countries, domestic resources have shifted from anti-malaria efforts to other priorities as case numbers have dwindled.

“Political will is the single most important aspect for eliminating malaria,” Dr. Espinal said. “We have effective tools: bed nets, vector control methods, treatments. We get to a certain point — we see the end of the tunnel — and then we risk losing the commitment.”

The situation is most dire in Venezuela, where President Nicolás Maduro has refused to accept most medical donations amid an economic crisis. Malaria infections, along with hunger and tuberculosis, have surged since 2008.

As Venezuelans cross borders into Guyana, Colombia and northern Brazil, they may bring the infection with them. Breeding conditions for mosquitoes are favorable in those regions, so transmission may increase, according to Dr. Alexandre Macedo de Oliveira, a malaria researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“Until there is a government in Venezuela willing to do something about it, it’s hard to do anything but wait,” said Mr. Moreno, who serves on the End Malaria Council, a response coordination team headed by Bill Gates.

“Mosquitoes don’t respect borders,” Mr. Moreno added.

In recent years, the fight against malaria in Central America has grown more complex. Lingering cases are concentrated in rural areas, where communities lack immediate access to health care and transmission is challenging to detect and disrupt.

Extreme flooding can increase breeding sites for mosquitoes, and the two that are the region’s main sources of malaria — Anopheles darlingi and Anopheles albitarsis — have begun to show resistance to insecticide.","In a Rare Success, Paraguay Conquers Malaria",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/health/paraguay-venezuela-malaria.html

Today’s cryptic by Richard Silvestri was typically challenging; the northwest corner was, by far, the most difficult to me. I also thought that it transcended the genre a bit by requiring some knowledge other than just a facility with language, which made it very fun.

For example, at 7D, “One international organization in possession of Roma robot,” the run-of-the-mill approach would be to assume that the letters R-O-M-A appear somewhere internally in the entry, since the words “in possession of” refer to that word (and “One international organization” would define the outer portion of the entry). The answer, though, is AUTOMATON, which means “robot.” The definition fits the cryptic rules, and A UN stands for “One (A) international organization (U.N., or United Nations).” But whither “roma?” Well, “Roma” is a paste tomato variety that is used to make sauce — you’ve probably opened a can of Romas once or twice in your life. So the internal word that I’d expect to be “roma” is TOMATO.

Another case of this appears at 4A, “Jazzy guy, pocketing 200 milligrams of diamonds from the East, falls.” It’s probably safe to assume that a puzzle solver recognizes a “jazzy guy” as a CAT. We might also assume 200 would appear as CC, though, and milligrams as MGS, and both of those are misses in this case. In actuality, we’re looking for 200 milligrams of diamonds, since no word in a cryptic puzzle is wasted. 200 milligrams of diamonds? That’s a CARAT. Next, we see that the CARAT is coming “from the East” — i.e., heading west, or reading from right to left. Take CAT, insert TARAC, you get a CATARACT, which defines waterfalls as well as an eye ailment. The two definitions are related: A cataract in one’s eye resembles the opaque white of a white-water rapid flowing down a rock face.",Variety: Cryptic Crossword,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/30/crosswords/variety-cryptic-crossword.html

Putin of Russia on Thursday during a freewheeling, raucous rally ostensibly intended to solidify support for Montana’s Republican Senate candidate.

Taunting Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, with a refusal to apologize for calling her “Pocahontas,” Mr. Trump imagined a debate during which he would gently throw an ancestry testing kit at Ms. Warren to make her prove the Native American heritage she has controversially claimed.

“We are going to do it gently because we’re the #MeToo generation, so we have to be very careful,” the president said to scattered laughter, adding that he would donate $1 million to charity if Ms. Warren followed through. Mr. Trump, who has faced accusations of sexual assault and harassment, announced earlier in the day that Bill Shine, who was ousted from Fox News over his handling of the network’s harassment scandals, would take a position on his administration’s communications staff.

Mr. Trump was in Montana, he unabashedly told the crowd, to settle a political score with Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat who is tangled in a tough re-election campaign with Matt Rosendale, the state auditor. The president blamed Mr. Tester for the failed nomination of Dr. Ronny L.

The company told us that it was collecting data from 13.5 million smart TVs in the United States. But I asked dozens of friends about it, and they had never heard of the company. Much of the data that Samba TV collects comes from people who have agreed to enable its recommendation software while setting up a TV from one of more than a dozen brands, including Sony and Sharp.

But it quickly became clear that it’s incredibly difficult to figure out what consumers see and agree to when they set up smart TVs.

The best way, of course, would be to buy a bunch of TVs. But even if I did that, I could end up with models without Samba TV’s software (and the strange problem of a TV collection in the office). One of my sources suggested visiting an electronics store and resetting a few televisions. I was excited about playing detective as I strode into the Best Buy near Lincoln Center, but my confidence quickly gave way to disappointment when I was told that the TVs were on “demo mode” and could not be reset. When I explained that I was concerned about privacy and data tracking on the sets, I was told — with a strange look — that I could visit the manufacturer’s website for that information. A call to the chain P.C. Richard & Son yielded a similar result.

While Sony and other companies do provide information on how to enable or disable “Samba Interactive TV,” Sony’s website didn’t show me how the service might appear during setup or explain what information it would be gathering. And the controls vary even across their own models. For someone who likes to do these things on my own, it was incredibly frustrating.

Finally, I was able to see the screens for myself by reaching out to The Wirecutter, a review site owned by The New York Times that recently assessed a slew of smart TVs. Chris Heinonen, one of the writers, patiently reset a few TVs and took photos of the Samba TV opt-in screens. I also asked a frustrated consumer whom I had interviewed to reset his TV and send me photos of the set-up process, and the two sets of images matched. Privacy advocates who saw the pictures said the trade-off was not clear for consumers, who often quickly click through setup so they can start using their new television.",Outsmarted by a Smart TV?

Mr. Schultz apologized, and Ms. Ingraham accepted the apology.

The ratings of “The Ed Show,” which was broadcast on weeknights, never soared, and he moved to weekend duty before being given a weekday slot. His and other underperforming shows were canceled in 2015. In April, he told a National Review podcast that he had been fired for supporting Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primaries.

At MSNBC, Mr. Schultz was known for his embrace of the labor movement at a time when the mainstream media was all but ignoring it, said David Shuster, a former MSNBC host, in a Twitter post on Thursday.

“Ed,” he said, “focused on American blue collar workers most of the MSM had long forgotten.”

Edward Andrew Schultz was born on Jan. 27, 1954, in Norfolk, Va. His father, George, was an aeronautical engineer; his mother, Mary, was a schoolteacher. He played quarterback at Minnesota State University, Moorhead, where he led the N.C.A.A. Division II in passing in 1977. After graduating he tried out for teams in the National Football League, including the Jets, and the Canadian Football League without success. He then began his career in radio, originally as a sportscaster.

One veteran diver, a former Thai Navy SEAL, lost consciousness and died early Friday after placing spare tanks along the route. Meanwhile, oxygen is starting to run low in the remote cavern where the children have taken refuge.

Three of those in the cavern are reported by the authorities to be weakening, and despite a round-the-clock pumping operation, the threat remains that monsoon rains could push water levels in their precarious refuge even higher.

The initial euphoria in Thailand and around the world that all 13 people had been found alive has given way four days later to deep anxiety over the challenge of getting them out.

Still, his resignation on Thursday stunned me.

Why quit when you’ve already endured all the mortification that he has? Why not crawl, in your reduced and pitiable form, to the finish line and at least get points for devotion?

It’s not as if Pruitt is saving himself from exposure as a fun-size Trump-in-training motivated solely by his own glorification and pampering. At this point his true colors are vivid and indelible, and came out somewhere on the timeline between the construction of a $43,000 soundproof booth for his most important calls and his insistence that his security detail drive him from Ritz-Carlton to Ritz-Carlton on the hunt for his favorite lotion.

707,707,2018-07-06,www.nytimes.com,"There has never been a cabinet official who has survived as many scandals as Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency — until his resignation Thursday. Mr. Pruitt faced up to 19 separate investigations into his conduct reflecting a stunning degree of disregard for federal ethics, special-interest and procurement rules. The sheer volume of investigations would be comic but for the harm Mr. Pruitt wrought. Although the mess he leaves behind will linger, Mr. Pruitt’s departure offers good news for the nation — but ominous portents for President Trump.

The full extent of Mr. Pruitt’s ethics lapses were incredible even to those normally supportive of the president — the $43,000 soundproof room, the multimillion-dollar security details. He used special hiring authority to bring on ex-lobbyists and give raises to key aides; worst of all, he reportedly retaliated against agency employees who raised concerns about his spending or management.

Mr. Pruitt’s near-complete disregard for taxpayers’ trust made for a great deal of work not only for the many government investigators probing his behavior, but also for journalists and government watchdogs. Our group alone filed 20 legal matters, including litigation focusing on Mr. Pruitt’s and the E.P.A.’s failure to produce documents about his actions — or even to create them. There are too many reported instances in which agency employees were instructed not to document meetings or often avoided the creation of certain documents — a brazen dodge of the laws requiring both preservation and production of such materials so the people know what our government is doing, and why.

Mr. Pruitt’s departure may be reason for celebration, but the mess that he created is substantial. He has turned the agency into an ethics and regulatory Superfund site that will take years to clean up. Thanks largely to him, the ethics system at the E.P.A. is broken and in need of repair. Why did no one with authority in the agency step in to stop him, or support whistle-blowers who tried to speak the truth? The involvement of political appointees in this process, and the apparent fear of retaliation instilled in officials across the agency, suggest to us that the current system is unable to ensure that federal ethics standards are upheld. Nor are all the investigations into Mr. Pruitt likely to vanish just because he has resigned; if his use of public office for private gain has caught the eye of federal prosecutors, there may be more coming.",Opinion | Pruitt’s Resignation Is Just the Beginning,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/opinion/scott-pruitt-resignation-wheeler.html

“I have what?”

It seemed impossible — I’d been vegan almost five years to the day my foot blew up. I’d heard of gout, sure, listening to Ben Franklin’s character sing, “A farmer, a lawyer, and a sage/A bit gouty in the leg” on the “1776” Broadway cast album. But I thought it was something kings in the 18th century contracted from overdoing the mutton.

According to the pamphlets my podiatrist gave me, though, gout is something some middle-aged people, mostly men, get from eating large amounts of red and organ meats, shellfish, consuming too much beer, not looking after their weight, or a combination thereof. None of this applied to me except the age thing. My blood test confirmed the doctor’s suspicions; monosodium urate monohydrate crystals had gathered at my ankle like unwanted relatives.

The cortisone allowed me to walk normally by the next morning and in my mind, the doctor had “fixed” the problem. But over the next three years I would suffer increasingly ferocious, unexpected attacks in both ankles, both big toes and both knees. The flare-ups sometimes lasted weeks despite flooding my body with as much water as I could hold, popping a daily crystal-busting allopurinol, and following a prescribed, puzzling diet.

No more quail or pigeon? Fine. But black beans, spinach, asparagus, raisins, chickpeas and hummus, all heart-healthy stuff I’d been eating for years, had to go, too. The first cortisone shot I got was also my last, not only because of my memory of that needle, but because cortisone, used long-term, can cause a variety of problems including damage to the cartilage near the injection and I am a very active person, or was when I got my first attack. There was nothing to do, finally, but shake hands with this new, unplanned and unwelcome Thing in my body, then fight it with everything I had.

I read all I could find about gout and pain management, following instructions to breathe, to be still, to “be with the pain,” to give it a name, a shape and a color — and to “center.” I got my daily exercise, too; when my knees, feet or ankles were swollen to three times their normal size, I used dumbbells to do curls, flies, military presses and other weighted exercises while seated on a bench, my cane on the floor next to me. I saw no choice — I had a life to live, articles to write, money to earn, songs to sing, family to see and friends to socialize with. I made no public announcement on any social network.

The status and ambition of the specials’ directors have also grown, shifting from craftsmen for hire to stylists to the auteur Bo Burnham, whose distinctive work with Jerrod Carmichael and Chris Rock reveals editing and camerawork in dialogue with setups and punch lines.

And this week represents another shift as Netflix releases the first half of “The Comedy Lineup,” eight bite-sized specials that run for 15 minutes each (the second batch arrives in early fall), a common allotment of time for a club set but not for televised stand-up. Most specials have traditionally been about an hour or a half-hour, with late-night TV sets running around five minutes, but the flexibility of the internet has destroyed the idea of a standard.

Yet what makes “The Comedy Lineup” an exciting addition is not the length of the specials, but Netflix’s attempt to give a platform to comics who are not household names.

Meanwhile, she said, homeowners should consider buying flood protection even if they are not in an area traditionally considered to be high risk. In recent years, she noted, areas that had not previously experienced problems have flooded.

The national flood program says 20 percent of claims are paid in areas considered low risk.

“Where it can rain,” Mr. Maurstad said, “it can flood.”

Cost of coverage varies, but the average annual federal flood premium for 2018 increased by 8 percent to $935, according to FEMA. Mr. Maurstad noted that policies for homes in low-risk areas cost around $500. Premiums in high-risk areas, however, can run to four or five figures, Ms. Bach noted.

Here are some questions and answers about flood insurance:

What does a federal flood policy cover?

National Flood Insurance Program policies cover up to $250,000 in damage to the home’s structure, and $100,000 for its contents. (Extra coverage may be bought from private insurers.) But federal policies generally don’t cover living expenses, like the cost of temporary housing.

How can I keep my flood insurance premium affordable?

Homeowners in high-risk areas who take steps to protect their properties, such as by elevating mechanical systems or even the entire home, can see as much as a 60 percent reduction in premiums, according to FEMA. The agency offers grants to help cover the cost of elevating homes, but the process can take time. So interested consumers should apply sooner rather than later, Ms. Bach said. “Be patient.”

Other suggestions for reducing flood insurance costs are available on FEMA’s website.

717,717,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"In the Reagan era, the idea of a political vision centered on children influenced many Democrats and some Republicans, including conservatives. As Democratic governor of Arizona, Bruce Babbitt declared 1985 “The Year of the Child,” earning mockery from The Arizona Republic for offering voters “quiche” rather than the “meat and potatoes” of Arizona politics, such as water rights and economic development. (A book called “Real Men Don’t Eat Quiche” was popular in the mid-1980s.) A National Commission on Children was started, where liberals and social conservatives such as Kay Coles James, now president of the Heritage Foundation, found common ground on an ambitious agenda that included a child tax credit and the children’s health program that Mr. Trump now proposes to cut. While the commission’s 1991 recommendations were widely derided as overly ambitious, most of them were enacted within a few years.

Kid-centered politics, in its first phase, was quite successful — at least if judged by the standards of whether it helped create programs that improved life for children, established some basis for bipartisan consensus, and in a few cases gave politicians an issue to run on. CHIP funding, for example, was a winning issue for Democrats in both the 2006 and 2008 elections, and restoring funding for the children’s health program was one of Barack Obama’s first moves in the White House. Between 1980 and 2010, funding for children’s programs more than tripled, in current dollars, according to the Urban Institute’s annual “Kids’ Share” report.

For all that success, children-centered politics alone didn’t quite live up to Mr. Greenberg’s promise of its transformational power. Kids didn’t open the door to a broader recognition of the value of government. They don’t force voters to confront the imbalances of power in the workplace and the larger economy that have led to stagnant or declining wages for the majority of working families. Those underlying conditions limit life chances for children, as well as for young adults and parents, in ways that government redistribution programs can’t compensate for. Children can be carved out, as a kind of special vulnerable category, without challenging the underlying structures that lead to inequality.

A focus on children could even be, and was, compatible with the sort of business-friendly and Wall Street-friendly politics that Democrats adopted in the Clinton era — the very brand of politics many young Democrats are eager to relegate to the past. Democrats of the current era, including most of the prospective 2020 presidential candidates, are unlikely to be satisfied with a political language that focuses mainly on children. They’re on to bigger ideas that get to the core of the economy and fairness, like a job guarantee or universal basic income. Even universal child care seems to have slipped from the agenda.

There’s also a dangerous strain of kids-first politics, one that focuses on the relative benefits of programs for the elderly and disabled, Social Security and Medicare, compared with those for kids. That makes sense if the only resources to increase benefits for kids could come from those programs rather than, for example, closing the tax loopholes for private equity.",Opinion | Trump Politicized Children.

As President Trump’s global trade war escalates, with the latest round of tariffs going into effect on Friday, his administration is doing just that. The new wrinkle is that it is no longer clear who is being set up to triumph or fail. Tariffs directed at products from one country — whether that’s steel from Canada and China or ca rs from Italy — are just as likely to affect American companies and hurt their workers.

That message came through loud and clear in recent days during the public comment period on the administration’s proposed tariffs on imported cars and parts. The global auto industry relies on supply chains that were built on the free movement of parts and goods. Suppliers, dealers and car manufacturers in the United States and other countries are petrified by the damage that the tariffs could do to their businesses.

General Motors, which warned that the tariffs could lead to job losses in the United States, said in its comments that the new levies could end up “isolating U.S. businesses like G.M. from the global market that helps to preserve and grow our strength here at home.”",Opinion | Making America Unemployed Again,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/opinion/trump-tariffs-harley-davidson-auto.html

In countries where communists are a minority, Mr. Banning wrote, he could photograph people who became party members “out of conviction rather than as a career move,” and in doing so, take an illustrative pulse of the Red Revolution.

On one side are news organizations, broadcasters and music companies that want to control how their content spreads across the web, and to be paid more for it. On the other are tech companies such as Facebook and Google, which argue that they funnel viewers and advertising revenue to media outlets, and free-speech advocates, who say that regulating the internet would set a dangerous precedent and limit access to information.

That battle flared up in Europe on Thursday. Two powerful industries faced off — technology against media, platforms against publishers — in an unusually aggressive lobbying campaign in the European Parliament over a bill that would impose some of the world’s strictest copyright laws, which would have required tech companies to filter out unlicensed content and pay for its use.

On this occasion, tech prevailed; the proposal was voted down.

The decision came amid broader efforts in Brussels to rein in tech giants. European regulators have already brought in tough new privacy rules, and are considering enhancing them. They have hit Silicon Valley companies with hefty antitrust fines, and are investigating them over their tax practices and handling of data. And like elsewhere in the world, they are increasingly skeptical of the argument made by internet companies that they are simply impartial platforms that cannot be held responsible for what is posted on their pages.

“Making content available on the internet does not come without responsibility,” said Eleonora Rosati, an associate professor on intellectual property law at the University of Southampton’s law school in England, who has been tracking the bill. “Rights holders want to control how their content is made available, shared and indexed.”",Tech Giants Win a Battle Over Copyright Rules in Europe,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/business/eu-parliament-copyright.html

Prison stole from him the critical years in the lives of young daughters. In a letter written to his daughter Zenani shortly after her 12th birthday, he reminds her of a brief visit he had with her nearly a decade before, during the time when he had gone underground and was living away from home: “In a corner you found … my clothing. After collecting it, you gave it to me and asked me to go home. You held my hand for quite some time, pulling desperately and begging me to return. ”

Reading his anguished account, we understand another function of letters: to make memories tangible. He sought to remind his 12-year-old not only of his own love but also of the love that her heartbroken, 2-year-old self once felt for her vanished father. Winnie Mandela was briefly incarcerated while pregnant with Zenani, and Mr. Mandela reminded his daughter that she was the rare person who’d served jail time even before she was born.

Mr. Mandela’s letters tell a story beyond their own words. The printed volume includes several images of the pages. His handwriting is careful but crowded, as though trying to include more words than any page could hold. Perhaps he is saving rationed paper and ink, but he also seems to be tying a rope bridge of words to carry him from prison to the home where his wife and children await.

While these letters overflow their pages, there’s also a haunting sense of all that’s not expressed. Mr. Mandela wrote knowing his letters would be censored. He often asks about earlier missives, possibly intercepted or destroyed. On Aug. 1, 1970, he writes to Winnie: “Can it be that you did not receive my letter of July 1? How can I explain your strange silence at a time when contact between us has become so vital?”

He must also have known that these letters would one day be read by people all over the world. This loss of privacy is also a loss of the intimacy at the heart of our most sustaining relationships. He laments, “There are affairs in life where third parties, no matter who they are, should not be let in at all.” But he knew, too, how to sneak in a thousand unspoken words. To Winnie he writes, “I suspect that you intended the picture to convey a special message that no words could ever express.

That is: Can people accept more crowded neighborhoods, in a city that is already the second most densely populated among big cities in the nation, if they feel that elected leaders do not have a decent plan — or a clue?

As Breed notes, San Francisco has created only one home for every eight new jobs between 2010 and 2015. She may not be ready to utter a hard truth that some residents already have: that not everyone who wants to live there can.

In Seattle, the nation’s fastest-growing city for this decade, the social contract is nearly broken. The city used to be run by creative problem solvers. Now, an ideologically driven City Council dreams up new things to anger residents while seeming to let the homeless have the run of the place.

The latest backward move was a tax on jobs — quickly repealed after a citizens’ revolt. While the council was trying to target Amazon, the city’s biggest private employer, the tax would have also hurt grocery stores and family-run businesses, as if they caused the homeless crisis and spike in real estate.

An unholy alliance of socialists and developers threatens to destroy the city’s single-family neighborhoods with a major upzoning — further disrupting trust between residents and politicians. If the intent is to make Seattle more affordable, this approach has failed. The city has built more new units of housing over the last five years than in the prior half-century. And yet Seattle continues to lead the nation in home price increases.

Vancouver has taxed speculation, hitting foreign buyers and those who own homes that sit empty. Prices have stabilized somewhat. But the globalization of the housing market is a problem more particular to British Columbia.

No matter what you hear anecdotally, people will continue to move to the West Coast. The City of St. Francis has seen far worse than the present crisis. More than half the population was homeless after the 1906 earthquake. But by midcentury, it was the American city, birthplace of the United Nations.

We need a new urbanism. For all the grumping about how great the cities facing the Pacific used to be, they can be greater still if the bright minds now trying to “disrupt” a grilled cheese sandwich can focus on the biggest challenge of this generation.

This generation, unlike the ones that came before it, is as likely as not to earn less than their parents. Among people who did not plan to have children, 23 percent said it was because they were worried about the economy. A third said they couldn’t afford child care, 24 percent said they couldn’t afford a house and 13 percent cited student debt.

Financial concerns also led people to have fewer children than what they considered to be ideal: 64 percent said it was because child care was too expensive, 43 percent said they waited too long because of financial instability and about 40 percent said it was because of a lack of paid family leave.

Women face another economic obstacle: Their careers can stall when they become mothers.

This spring, Brittany Butler, 22, became the first person in her family to graduate from college, and she will start graduate school in social work in the fall. She said it would probably be at least 10 years before she considered having children, until she could raise them in very different circumstances than in her poor hometown neighborhood in Baton Rouge, La.

She admits being “a little nervous” that it may become harder to get pregnant, but she wants to pay off her student loans and, most of all, be able to live in a safe neighborhood.

Starting a family used to be what people did to embark on adulthood; now many say they want to wait. Last year, the only age group in which the fertility rate increased was women ages 40 to 44.

There may not be method to Mr. Riley’s madness, but there is a measure of coherence, of intellectual discipline, to his wildness. What Cassius wants is what everyone wants: success, security, solidarity, sex. But the movie’s imaginary world forces him to make choices that seem unfair if not impossible — between political commitment and personal ambition, between love and power, between staying true to his friends and becoming a sellout. Which makes it a lot like the real world.

Which is how satire works, of course. And like other works of contemporary satire, “Sorry to Bother You” sometimes has a strenuously chaotic, all-over-the-place feeling. Mr. Riley misses a few easy targets, and occasionally shows off his skill at shooting oversize fish in tiny barrels. He is after big game, though — race and class, labor and capital, art and technology — and his aim, while eccentric, is very often true.

I hesitate to unpack too much from his grab bag of gags and conceits. His take on the code-switching that is part of how African-Americans function in white-dominated social spaces involves giving certain characters access to a “white voice.” Sometimes when Mr. Stanfield and Mr. Hardwick open their mouths we hear David Cross and Patton Oswalt. Conceptually the joke might not be all that fresh, but the execution is weird enough to make it pretty hilarious.

A later development is so outlandish that it sets the movie wobbling on the edge of willful silliness. Unless, that is, it resets the premise and raises the stakes, turning a playful, barbed riff on identity politics and political economy into a nightmarish vision of impending human extinction.

Or — you see how the possibilities multiply, how the potential arguments swarm and swirl — a vision of revolution. Mr. Riley’s futurism is not merely speculative or playful, and while “Sorry to Bother You” is too nimble to be polemical, it is insistently political. Cassius and his peers belong very much to the present. Like many young people, they drift into adulthood in search of pleasure and meaning, money and sex, navigating their own anxieties and a radically inhumane but somehow also tolerable social order.

Some newspaper accounts said he was shot behind the right ear on horseback and fell to the ground without a word. Others ascribe to him a near-Shakespearean speech, delivered with his final breath, proclaiming the glory of the Union. Still others said he rode a quarter-mile to a field hospital, where he opened his coat to display his wound (odd if he had been shot in the head) and asked a surgeon, “Does this look bad?” before dying.

The battle at Gettysburg — the last invasion of United States territory by a foreign ground force — ended in resounding loss for Gen. Robert E. Lee, commander of the Confederate army. Although the conflict would grind on for two more years, with catastrophic loss of life, the Union seized fortune’s higher ground in the Civil War overall by driving Lee’s army into retreat at Gettysburg.

For newspaper correspondents, the Civil War also marked the beginning of a modern era for journalism, when technology allowed rapid reporting on momentous events.

For example, news of America’s first conflicts — the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War — traveled slowly, mostly by foot, horseback or ship.

In contrast, coverage from Gettysburg was accelerated by the growing network of telegraph lines, which allowed some dispatches filed from the battlefield in the morning to be published and on the street that very day or the next, especially in the more industrialized, urban North.

While not providing quite the immediate impact of TV networks broadcasting the bombing of Baghdad — the opening salvo of the Iraq war — in real time, the faster pace of reporting-to-publishing-to-circulation via telegraph during the Civil War altered how the public and leaders, on both sides, learned of and debated the war effort, anticipating today’s hyper-fast news cycle.

Great battles have been recorded by famous bylines since the time of Homer. But Gettysburg also was the rare and tragic instance of a parent discovering, and writing about, the loss of a child on a battleground where the journalist had stood, watched and taken notes.

Ms. L. was paroled from detention the following week, a few days before the government’s response was due in her lawsuit.

She was terrified to make the trip, certain that she would be arrested in the airport and sent back to Congo without ever seeing S. again. I met her briefly the next day, in a shelter on the outskirts of the city. Gelernt had gotten assurances from the government that Ms. L. and S. would be reunited, but he didn’t know when. She sat on a worn sofa in the shelter’s common room, wearing sweatpants and a thin sweater and plastic flip-flops, her face gaunt beneath tight braids. She kneaded her hands and looked into her lap as Gelernt asked her what S.’s favorite foods were, what color clothes she would like, what toys she might want to play with when they were finally together again. “Frozen,” Ms. L. whispered.

There were some creased, printed-out photos of her and S., taken before they fled Congo, spread out on a pool table at the end of the room. In one, Ms. L. smiles at the camera while S. sits behind her braiding her hair. You can recognize her in the pictures, the same softness in her eyes, the long, strong hands. But the woman in the room was, I would guess, 50 or 60 pounds thinner than the woman in the photographs. Before we said goodbye, we stood next to the pool table looking at the pictures. I remarked on how beautiful S. was, and she slowly ran a finger over her daughter in the photo, then gathered the papers up and slid them into a manila folder that she held against her chest.

The next night, after I left, they were reunited in the shelter. I’ve spoken with Gelernt several times about the moment of their reunion, what he called the most emotional thing he’d experienced in 25 years of doing immigration work. Ms. L. stood near him waiting for her daughter on a worn marble staircase just inside the shelter’s front door. When the door swung open, she crouched and stretched her arms wide. S. stepped through the doorway and saw her, and the most beautiful smile spread over the girls face, Gelernt said. She toppled forward, and Ms. L. gathered her in her arms and fell back onto the marble stairs. The look on her face as she held her daughter was almost too emotional to witness. For the next minute they lay there, clinging to each other and rocking from side to side. The only sound in the hall was a low, rhythmic moan, punctuated by S.’s higher-pitched cry.

Eventually they sat up and walked up the steps and settled on a bench in the shelter’s hallway. After a few minutes, Ms. L leaned toward S. and spoke to her in Lingala, then pointed to Gelernt, and S. stood up and walked over to him and wrapped her arms around his waist. “There are times when this work is so tiring,” Gelernt said. “But something like this, if people could only see this, I think it could change the way some of them think about these issues. This isn’t abstract policy, this is a mother and a daughter who have been through more than we can imagine. It was the rawest possible emotion,” Gelernt said.

Three days later, the immigration judge who ruled that Ms. L. would be deported denied the motion to reopen her case. “It’s horrific,” Gelernt told me. “It’s obviously going to be appealed.” As of now, they’re awaiting a decision on that appeal. Gelernt told me that S. is doing a little better, going to school in the day with some other kids in the shelter. Ms. L. remains terrified that ICE agents will show up there to take her away, or take S. away, and that she’ll be sent back to Congo and what she says and the government has agreed is certain death.",Can the A.C.L.U.

735,735,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"On Friday, Earth will swing toward the outermost point in its orbit, known as aphelion. You, me and everyone on the planet will be three million miles farther from the sun than when we are closest to it.

The change occurs because our planet’s orbit is not perfectly circular. Instead, it is squashed into an ellipse with the sun offset from the center — an effect that causes Earth to orbit to its farthest point every July and its innermost point, or perihelion, every January (the exact dates vary slightly from year to year).

So, while record-breaking temperatures and raging wildfires in the Northern Hemisphere might lead you to believe the sun is punishingly close right now, remember that it is just the opposite. In fact, the extra distance causes the amount of received sunlight to drop by 7 percent compared to January.

[Sign up to get reminders on your calendar for space and astronomy events.]

But don’t expect any relief from summer. Seasons on Earth are the product of changes in the amount of direct sunlight as the planet tilts toward and away from the sun — not its orbital path. It would take a much greater swing, so that the amount of received sunlight dropped significantly, in order to notice the difference.",Never Mind the Summer Heat: Earth Is at Its Greatest Distance From the Sun,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/science/earth-sun-aphelion.html

It felt as if that was what was happening all over the newly rich, nakedly ambitious Premier League. England had not qualified for the World Cup that year, and so — in the weeks after the tournament had finished — its clubs seemed determined to bring the World Cup to England instead. U.S.A. 1994 seemed to be treated as a sort of soccer equivalent to the home shopping network. Now, thanks to technology and a better understanding of scouting and analytics, it’s little more than a monthlong summer spectacle.

Most important, the world is much smaller than it once was. Nowhere is too exotic, too unfamiliar. Romania is not so far away. Clubs not only have much more sophisticated networks of contacts across the planet, they can now track possible targets remotely, thanks to digital platforms like Wyscout, InStat and Scout 7.

Teams and their scouts can watch nearly every game, in (almost) every league around the world, from the comfort of their own offices. Many of those computerized programs allow scouts to focus on the individual player they are interested in.

To ensure they know exactly what they are watching, leading teams have developed complex algorithms to quantify, essentially, how well a player needs to perform in Romania to be the equal of an average player in Italy. That dovetails with the work of expert analytics departments.

Crucially, they can tabulate data on any player for years. One scout estimates that his staff follows potential targets, on average, for seven years to have as complete a picture as possible of their abilities. No player at the World Cup this summer is unfamiliar. “We should know every athlete there,” one chief scout said.","When the World’s Greatest Soccer Players Gather, Scouts Stay Away",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/sports/world-cup/quarterfinals.html
737,737,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"In June 1972, Emanuel Celler, a Democratic congressman from Brooklyn, sat down for an interview with The New York Times in advance of a primary that he was virtually assured of winning.

Representative Celler had arrived in Congress with the backing of Tammany Hall, during the presidency of Warren G. Harding — in 1923 — and now, half a century later, he had the support of the powerful Brooklyn party boss Meade Esposito, whose celebrity in the borough was such that a veal dish bearing his name appeared on the menu of a popular restaurant on Montague Street near the Brooklyn courthouses, which were filled with the judges he had essentially placed. This omnipotence was to have insulated Mr. Celler from his own irrelevance. He kept such a distance from his constituents that he did not even maintain an office in the district, which encompassed largely white middle-class Flatbush, Midwood and Marine Park as well as parts of poor African-American neighborhoods in central Brooklyn. He was 84, and he was cranky.

Of his two opponents, he concerned himself with only one, a 30-year-old Harvard Law School graduate, Elizabeth Holtzman, a reform candidate who had been active in the civil rights movement and served as mayoral aide to John V. Lindsay. “Her fulminations are as useless, as we say, as a wine cellar without a corkscrew,” Mr. Celler told The Times, proceeding to call her campaign statements “irrational” and her persona, more generally, “as irritating as a hangnail.”

Like Representative Joseph Crowley, the longtime incumbent who lost New York’s 14th Congressional District seat last month, blind to the force of a young, female challenger, Mr. Celler didn’t see what was coming. Ms. Holtzman’s victory was as likely as “a toothpick’s chance of toppling the Washington Monument,” he said.","Before Ocasio-Cortez, the Elizabeth Holtzman Effect",http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/nyregion/before-ocasio-cortez-the-elizabeth-holtzman-effect.html
738,738,2018-07-03,www.nytimes.com,"Richardson got his start in the early 1990s, when he lucked into a job as the host of “Football Italia,” the first show to air Italian domestic soccer in Britain, after Paul Gascoigne, the mercurial English midfielder who had agreed to be the presenter, stopped turning up for work. (Like a natural-born striker, he has a gift for being in the right place at the right time.) The show’s linking sequences, which featured Richardson eating elaborate desserts and reading the newspaper in sun-dazzled piazzas, gave it an unbuttoned, off-duty feel. Instead of treating soccer like a blood sport, he assumed the attitude of an aesthete, savoring ironies, tracking subplots on and off the field and in general doing his best to show the viewer a good time. You can still hear the warmth and languor of Italy in Richardson’s voice.

Given all these deviations from the norm, it might be tempting to call Richardson an anti-pundit, but that sounds altogether too effortful for a man who embodies the ideal of sprezzatura. “Pundit-satirist” might be nearer the mark, for Richardson’s distinct charm lies in his recognition of the inherent absurdity of what he does for a living. Most people who get paid to talk about soccer in public — to trot out the old chestnuts about players taking their chances and giving 110 percent — deliver their opinions in a tone pitched somewhere between that of an irascible headmaster and a time-strapped auctioneer. Richardson, by contrast, speaks with the breezy spontaneity of someone who knows that nothing, or nothing more serious than entertainment, is really at stake. It is not that he lacks passion — his speech crackles with exclamations of delight: “Woof!” “Wow!” “Mmmm!” “Tasty!” Rather, to adapt a phrase of Geoff Dyer’s, he has mastered the trick of sounding 100 percent ironic and 100 percent sincere at the same time.

In all likelihood, this year’s World Cup final will turn out to be another low-scoring foul-fest, like Italy ’90 or U.S.A. ’94 or South Africa 2010 — or come to think of it, just about every final I have been alive to witness — but, as of this writing, I can still dream of a 4-3 victory for England over Portugal, in which Harry Kane scores the winning goal, a bicycle kick from the edge of the penalty area, in the last minute of extra time and Cristiano Ronaldo is sent off for repeated diving, starts to cry and then trips over his feet as he walks from the field. Whatever happens, it is comforting to know that Richardson will be there at the final whistle with his quips and puns to put the whole harrying joy of soccer fandom into perspective and ease the arrival of the footballing winter to come.",Letter of Recommendation: ‘The Totally Football Show With James Richardson’,http://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-the-totally-football-show-with-james-richardson.html

“What’s happening at those detention centers in Texas is unconscionable, just beyond belief,” said Navratilova, the top-ranked woman in tennis for much of the 1970s and ’80s. “All these people who are lying through their teeth, saying, ‘The kids are O.K. — it’s like summer camp.’ I’m like, ‘Are you kidding me?’

“We complain about Boko Haram taking the girls in Nigeria, and here we are doing it to these women and men. And the kids are marked for life. Some will never be reunited. Some parents will never know what happened to their kid.”

China’s state-controlled news media echoed the sentiment.

“As the American side has gradually closed in on China, it has aroused the ire of Chinese society, and made Chinese people more clearheaded, more united,” said an editorial on the website of Global Times, a nationalist tabloid owned by the Communist Party. “Washington has obviously underestimated the giant force that the world’s opposition and China’s retaliation can produce.”

But Chinese news outlets have stopped short of language that would suggest appetite for a major escalation, such as a consumer boycott of American brands.

China has become a key market for brands such as Apple, Nike, Starbucks and General Motors. Consumer boycotts have proven effective in Beijing’s earlier disputes with South Korea, Japan and the Philippines. But targeting American goods could be trickier. The iPhones, Chevrolets and other goods that American companies sell in China are often made in China, and by Chinese workers.

744,744,2018-06-13,www.nytimes.com,"DER: My word list originally started as a few English dictionaries combined with words that had previously appeared in crossword puzzles. Since then, I’ve probably added many thousands of words by hand. I try to pay attention to interesting words and phrases that come up in everyday life and I’ll add those to a list on my phone using the Notes app. I’ll check that list first when I’m filling a grid, whether that’s a themed puzzle or a themeless.

PASCO: I have a basic word list, which I haven’t maintained a lot. The only real changes I make are when I add new, fresh words that I want to include in a crossword. I can go into the program and manually give those words high scores in my list, so they get priority when I’m filling grids. I also fill manually — I use Crossfire, but I don’t use the Autofill feature. It takes longer, but guiding the whole fill process by hand makes me feel more in touch with the crossword. It really helps me get a sense of what letter patterns work in a grid and which ones don’t.

DER: If you rely on Autofill, that guarantees you won’t have the opportunity to introduce something new that isn’t in your word list, so we discourage it. I prefer a semi-supervised approach — using software to verify the fill you have so far still works, and suggesting words that you might want to put into the grid next, while you select words by hand. During that process, I often think of words that would also work, but weren’t in my list.

PASCO: One good resource for finding words outside your word list is Onelook.com. If you have an answer like ??RK??A?, you can look it up on the site and get a list of words that match that pattern. This has bailed me out so many times when filling a grid — sometimes, all it takes is one entry you hadn’t thought of to hold together an entire section.

Quality Is Never an Accident

PASCO: In terms of the words themselves, my fill philosophy is “clean fill above everything else.” Filling by hand guarantees that every part of the grid gets my attention, so junk words are less likely to slip in.

DER: I’ll second that. How you fill the grid doesn’t matter as much as ensuring that every word in your grid is high quality. Ideally, it should seem like you purposely chose every word to be in your crossword. This is especially true for themeless puzzles, where you begin with no constraints. Most constructors try to inject fresh words and phrases, often from current events or pop culture, that have never appeared before in a crossword. Other than that, we strive for liveliness, which is ultimately a judgment that can vary among constructors and editors. Conversational phrases like “WAIT, WHAT?” or “DON’T ASK” are always fun to include in a crossword. It’s hard to describe objectively, but most constructors would agree that ESCAPE ROOM and SUBTWEET (which Paolo debuted) are more lively than, say, the unremarkable ESSENCES or, ALAN-A-DALE, which is dreaded for its overuse.

PASCO: Thanks for the shout out, Kevin! By “debuted,” we mean that it appeared in The New York Times Crossword for the first time.

745,745,2018-07-05,www.nytimes.com,"WASHINGTON — Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, the front-runner to replace Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on the Supreme Court, once argued that President Bill Clinton could be impeached for lying to his staff and misleading the public, a broad definition of obstruction of justice that would be damaging if applied to President Trump in the Russia investigation.

Judge Kavanaugh’s arguments — expressed in the report of the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, which he co-wrote nearly 20 years ago — have been cited in recent days by Republicans with reservations about him and have raised concerns among some people close to Mr. Trump.

Maths, science, history and death?

This could be a school timetable in a state in Australia, if a proposal by the Australian Medical Association Queensland is accepted.

They want young people to be made more familiar with talking about the end of life.

Doctors say that improvements in medicine and an ageing population mean that there are rising numbers of families facing difficult questions about their elderly relatives and how they will face their last days.

But too often young people in the West are not prepared for talking about such difficult decisions. There is a taboo around the subject and most deaths happen out of sight in hospitals.

Pupils might have reservations about lessons in death education.

Dying days

But the Australian doctors argue that if the law and ethics around palliative care and euthanasia were taught in classrooms, it would make such issues less ""traumatic"" and help people to make better informed decisions.

Image caption Dr Richard Kidd says young people need to be better informed about the tough decisions at the end of life

Queensland GP Dr Richard Kidd says young people can find themselves having to make decisions about how relatives are treated in their dying days.

""I have seen people as young as 21 being thrust into the role of power of attorney,"" he says.

Their lack of knowledge makes it a steep learning curve in ""how to do things in a way that is in the best interests of their loved ones and complies with the law"", he says.

He says the taboo around death means that families usually avoid discussing until it is too late. Most people do not know how their relatives want to be treated if the worst happens.

""So we need to start preparing young people and getting them to have tough conversations with their loved ones,"" he says.

""Death lessons"" could include the legal aspects of what mental and physical capacity means, how to draw up a will and an advanced care plan, and the biological processes of dying and death.

Part of the culture

These topics could be incorporated into existing subjects, such as biology, medicine, ethics and law.

Dr Kidd says education around death would help countries like Australia, the US and the UK follow the example of Mexico, where death is an important part of the culture and even celebrated in the Day of the Dead festival.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are calls for talking about death to become part of the public culture

He gives the example of Ireland, where he says wakes held after a death can be ""joyous occasions"".

Introducing a culture of openly discussing death could even change where we die, according to Dr Kidd.

The vast majority of Australians die in hospital, even though many people say they would rather die at home with their family around them.

""Only 15% of people die at home but in the case of many more people, they could have died at home rather than hospital if there had only been a bit of preparation,"" says Dr Kidd.

Matter of life and death

A hundred years ago it was very normal for people to die at home. but modern medical technology allows life to be prolonged in hospital, even though the patient might not have great quality of life.

""People may decide that at a certain point they want to be able to die at home in comfort rather than being kept in hospital,"" he says.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Doctors say that families need to have conversations about how people want to spend their final days

The proposal for lessons in death has now been put to the Queensland education authorities and Dr Kidd hopes the message reaches other parts of the world.

""Our main aim is to get young people to start having those conversations with their parents and grandparents to learn more about how they want to die so that they know the answer when they need that information in the future,"" he says.

""It should be seen as a positive and proactive thing - information and knowledge can be really empowering to people.""

So perhaps this is something to bring up over your next family Sunday lunch.

It might not be an easy conversation but it could be a matter of life and death.

Amid England's celebrations after winning Tuesday's penalty shootout to enable them to progress to the quarter-finals of the World Cup, manager Gareth Southgate was comforting a Colombian player who had missed his penalty.

Southgate knows only too well what that feels like.

In the Euro 1996 tournament, England's semi-final against Germany went to penalties.

Southgate's saved penalty gave Germany the chance to go through to the final if they scored their next penalty, which they did.

The England manager at the time, Terry Venables, hugged a devastated Southgate.

Now, images of Southgate being consoled 22 years ago and being the consoler after Tuesday's game have emerged online, prompting praise for Southgate's compassion towards Colombia's Mateus Uribe, who missed his spot-kick.

One Twitter user tweeted this image of Venables talking to Southgate after his penalty miss in 1996.

President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration policy at the border with Mexico has made global headlines. But workplace raids in small US towns hundreds of miles away are also having a profound impact on these communities.

That morning, Carmen, a 46-year-old mother of four from Mexico, woke up at around 5:00, as she did most days, to prepare what her daughter, aged 20, would eat at work. She had made her some quesadillas, chicken, eggs, rice and beans, and packed everything with a bottle of water and some fruits.

The light of the day had started to come through the window of the kitchen, where Carmen did her things quietly to not disturb her two sons, one 26, the other 24, who were still asleep. The health of the youngest had deteriorated recently and her life was largely dedicated to taking care of him.

Ten years after crossing the border without papers, Carmen had finally reunited with three of her children. They had arrived separately over the years and stayed, undocumented, her other girl being the only one still left in their country.

""Take a rest mami,"" her daughter said as she went down the stairs of the small front porch of the tiny trailer where they lived in this community of Mexican migrants in the town of Norwalk, in rural Ohio. They hugged each other warmly, Carmen said ""God bless you, I love you"" and watched her go.

Carmen felt tired, the spring heat only making it worse, and went back to bed for a nap. Some time before midday, as she was ""having dreams"", her mobile phone rang. She ignored it. The person, a friend, called again and again she let it go. When it rang for a third time, she woke up.

""What's going on?""

""Hermana, your daughter wants to talk to you. But she can't... Immigration has caught us.""

Image caption Dozens of those arrested lived in the Jefferson Trailer Park in a suburb of the tiny town of Norwalk

Carmen's daughter had arrived in the US eight months earlier on a visa, now expired, and not gone back. She had found a job at a nearby gardening company, where many of their 300 neighbours also worked. They often left home early, when someone came to pick them up, and only returned when it was already late.

On that 5 June, a little bit after 7:00, some 200 armed federal agents, reportedly joined by helicopters and canine units, carried out a surprise immigration raid. Undercover officers walked in offering to give out doughnuts and, when the workers gathered in a room, they surprised them by shouting orders.

American citizens were to go to one side and the undocumented migrants to the other. ""We wanted to run,"" Carmen recalled her friend say, ""but we couldn't. If we ran to one side, there they were. If we ran to the other side, they were there too. They were everywhere.""

There, 114 undocumented workers were arrested. Around 50 lived in the trailer park.

""I don't know what they're going to do with us. We have no work, nowhere to go, no documents. We're scared.""

Carmen, whose daughter was arrested

Carmen told her friend, who had also been caught in the raid but was still able to use her phone, to ""cheer up, not cry or be sad"". She hung up without being able to speak to her daughter, locked the doors and started to pray. ""Everyone was afraid. They were saying the officers would come here, because they already had all the information.""

The rumours triggered panic. Some of the 64 trailers were left abandoned as residents fled, many to a nearby church where they sought shelter. They then took turns looking after the more than 80 boys and girls, mostly American-born, who, by the estimates of activists, were without their parents.

Two weeks later, many children here were still asking where they were.

Adults often told them there was nothing wrong, ""No pasa nada,"" and that they would return soon. Some, however, would probably be deported and never come back. ""They're suffering,"" Carmen said. ""It hurts us all.""

Children rarely came outside these days. Where they used to play, there were only abandoned toys. The streets were also empty and nobody seemed to give the once colourful gardens any attention. People carefully checked the windows when someone knocked on their trailers and one had already been put on sale.

The peace they once had, Carmen said, no longer existed.

With the arrest of her daughter, whose name Carmen did not want to reveal for fear of what could happen, her son's health worsened. He first stopped eating and, five days later, no longer talked. ""He got really sad,"" she said. Ten days after the raid, he threw up and passed out.

When the doctors came to see him, he was already dead. Carmen was left devastated.

""What they're doing is to punish [us]. [We] haven't killed anyone, aren't criminals... Only because [we] aren't from here?"" she asked. And cried. ""I don't know what they're going to do with us. We have no work, nowhere to go, no documents. We're scared.""

Image caption Most of those arrested were Mexicans and some families say they are considering going back to their country

Volunteers who came to see her and other relatives were left concerned by the signs of anxiety and depression many of them showed. They often broke down in tears when talking about how they were struggling to live - some trailers had already had their electricity cut as residents had not paid the bills - or what could happen to their families.

But they were not surprised. Critics say large-scale workplace raids, part of President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, are intentionally designed to terrify those at risk.

In April, the day after 97 workers were arrested at a meatpacking plant in Bean Station, Tennessee, some 530 children missed school. ""I cried,"" a teacher said, ""wondering which of my students were without parents"".

""Are they going to find Americans to do [those jobs] for the first time in 50 years? Suddenly Americans are going to go back to the fields with a shovel?""

Veronica Dahlberg, executive director of Hola Ohio

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a federal agency, said they had investigated Corso's Flower and Garden Center since last October, after the arrest of a woman suspected of selling stolen identity documents to people who were in the country irregularly.

She led them to the company where they found that Social Security numbers being used by some employers belonged to dead people - Corso's denied knowing it, saying it asked for ""honest and legitimate"" documents from its staff.

Two weeks after the raid, officials searched a large meat supplier in Salem, also in Ohio, and arrested 146 people, the largest workplace raid in a decade. When this happened, a landscaping company in Oberlin, next to Norwalk, told its workers that those without legal status should leave. Some 80 people, including Carmen's neighbours, walked out.

""We live in fear,"" she said, ""we no longer know that if we go out [we won't be] arrested.""

Authorities say unlawful employment is one of the key magnets drawing undocumented migrants to the country and reject the criticism, vowing that those who employ them will also be punished.

But as ICE is increasingly seen as the face of hard-line measures - especially after more than 2,300 children were forcibly separated from their parents at the border with Mexico as part of Mr Trump's now abandoned ""zero-tolerance"" policy - there are growing calls for the 20,000-strong agency created in 2003 to be dismantled.

Image caption Those arrested were parents to some 80 children in the trailer park

Carmen and her older son, who was also out of work, moved to a friend's trailer where religious messages decorated the walls. ""The Lord is my shepherd"" was the one in the living room. ""God loves you"" read another, in the kitchen. Dios, Carmen said, would protect them all.

Her friend's husband had also been arrested in the raid and she was left with their two teenage sons, one of them autistic, who believed his dad had gone out on a trip. ""This region is full of migrant workers,"" she said. ""If they all go, what will happen to the companies?""

Peter Skerry, a professor of Political Science and former Brookings Institute expert, wrote in 2013 that Americans had become dependent on irregular migrants. They were willing to work long hours on short notice being paid lower - often much lower - wages. ""Many hire [them] indirectly by relying on subcontractors who assume the risk of skirting the law.""

As the economy grows and unemployment falls, many businesses say they are desperate for workers, particularly those who do manual labour. Some sectors complain that restrictions on the number of visas given to foreigners who hold temporary, non-agricultural jobs have left places struggling to fill posts that are unappealing to Americans.

""Businesses can't survive without the labour of undocumented workers,"" said Veronica Dahlberg, executive director of Hola Ohio, a grassroots Latino group. ""Are they going to find Americans to do [those jobs] for the first time in 50 years? Suddenly Americans are going to go back to the fields with a shovel? I don't think so.""

Image caption Some residents supported the raid that arrested dozens of undocumented migrants

A few times a week, Carmen's daughter called her from the detention centre in Battle Creek, in neighbouring Michigan, where she was being held with some of the other women from Corso's. Activists had given some of the money they had raised to those arrested so they could buy phone credits and talk to their families. The conversations were very emotional but gave Carmen, who had not visited her in prison, some relief.

But, she wondered, what next? Any decision for her and her neighbours would not be easy. The current legislation makes it virtually impossible for undocumented people in the US, estimated to be some 11 million, to regularise their situation.

Would they go back to Mexico? Move to a different state? Stay where they were?

""A lot of people think that it's a matter of laziness, that the people aren't interested in legalising their status,"" said Jessica Ramos, a lawyer at Advocates for Basic Legal Equality, an Ohio-based non-profit firm that was providing legal assistance to some of the families. ""It's not the case. Most people don't have a path.""

It is a divisive issue. While there is broad support to offering citizenship to young migrants who were brought into the country irregularly, known as Dreamers, conservatives oppose any plan that could pave the way for older people to get their papers too.

""Illegal is illegal,"" said one resident of the quiet Norwalk, where Mr Trump got twice as many votes as Hillary Clinton in 2016 and not everyone was welcoming to the presence of undocumented migrants in their town of 17,000.

""'Adios',"" another said, sarcastically, ""it's the law and they're here illegally. I could help the police to kick them out."" A small-business owner said: ""I'm 'America First' and they shouldn't be here.""

""It's not that Norwalk is the problem,"" said Mayor Rob Duncan, a Republican. ""It's the laws that haven't been followed, haven't been corrected and those type of things that need to be taken care of... It's a big problem [and] it's going to take solutions on a national level.""

Image caption Volunteers gave out free pizzas to the residents, one of the few moments they came together

Carmen was still mourning the death of her son, whose funeral had been on the day before. The circumstances that led to his death were not clear and they were still investigating whether he had any previous medical condition unknown to the family or had killed himself. She was trying to send the body to Mexico to be buried but did not know if this was going to be possible.

Her daughter and the others arrested could face criminal charges including identity theft and tax evasion. Several had already been released while some had criminal records and previous deportation orders and were likely to remain in custody.

""I recognise that this is not our place but God knows why we're here, for necessity, she said. ""I pray to God because I know He'll touch Donald Trump's heart.""

Too many of us are neglecting to do exercises for strong muscles and bones, says Public Health England (PHE).

It's launched a new report giving advice on how people can age better by doing the right workouts.

While the message about doing aerobic exercise for a healthy heart and lungs is getting through, people are less clear about the need to look after their overall strength too, it says.

We should all be doing strengthening exercises at least twice a week.

Lifting weights is one option, but taking up tennis or dancing also works, says PHE and the Centre for Ageing Better.

Activities offering the most benefit include:

Ball games

Racket sports

Dance

Nordic walking (walking with poles to give your upper body a workout as well as your legs)

Resistance training (using weights or bands or your own body weight to push or pull against for a workout)

Yoga, Tai Chi and cycling are also somewhat good for bones, muscles and balance.

Only one in three men and one in four women is doing enough of the right types of exercise to keep both healthy and strong, say the experts.

Muscle and bone strengthening and balance activity can improve physical and wellbeing at any age and reduce the risk of an early death.

It can also help improve health during difficult or life-changing times like pregnancy, menopause, onset of or diagnosis of disease, retirement and recovery from hospitalisation.

Use it or lose it

The experts advise young people to build up muscle and bone mass, which tends to peak by the time we reach 30.

Older adults need exercises to maintain what they've hopefully already got and slow the natural decline that happens with age.

Unfit in middle age: Are you doomed?

Those who are frail and/or at risk of fractures, including people with osteoporosis, should be especially careful, however, particularly with higher-impact activities such as tennis, and seek advice from their doctor.

Dr Zoe Williams from Public Health England said: ""Being active isn't just about getting your heart pumping - although this is a good way to begin. Strength and balance activities work in conjunction with cardio activities like brisk walking, and come with a range of health benefits throughout your life - it's never too late to start.""

Boeing has agreed a deal that will give it control of Embraer's commercial jet business.

The proposed joint venture will give the US aerospace giant a significant stake in the market for smaller passenger planes.

Boeing has been courting Brazil's Embraer for some time.

The need for a deal has recently become more pressing since its European rival, Airbus, took control of Bombardier's C-Series regional jet programme.

Its deal with the Canadian company had threatened to give Airbus a significant advantage in the global marketplace.

The agreement, which values Embraer's commercial aircraft operations at $4.75bn, will restore parity between Boeing and Airbus.

Under the proposed deal, Embraer's commercial business will be placed in a new joint venture, with Boeing holding an 80% stake worth $3.8bn (£2.9bn).

Embraer is a Brazilian industrial champion and a major manufacturer of military systems.

News of the deal sent its shares down more than 10% in Sao Paulo on Thursday. Some investors had hoped Embraer's share of the joint venture would be higher than 20%.

Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing chief executive, said: ""By forging this strategic partnership, we will be ideally positioned to generate significant value for both companies' customers, employees and shareholders - and for Brazil and the US.""

Boeing said the deal is expected to close by the end of 2019 pending the necessary approvals.

Analysis

By Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent

This deal, if it goes ahead, will restore the cosy duopoly between Boeing and Airbus.

In the past, they had the market for large jets to themselves. In the segment beneath them sat Embraer and Bombardier, equally fierce rivals in the market for smaller ""regional"" jets.

Both companies, however, showed signs of rising above their station. Bombardier developed the C-series, a highly efficient aircraft family capable of competing directly with smaller versions of the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320.

Embraer, meanwhile, developed the E-195 E2 - slightly smaller, but still capable of playing in the same ballpark.

Boeing tried to kill off the C-series, protesting about its funding in the World Trade Organization. But that simply sent Bombardier into the arms of Airbus, which bought a majority stake in the C-series programme, strengthening its position in the market.

It's rare that a vote in the European Parliament prompts widespread outrage by social media users, academics, and technology leaders all at once.

But as the EU tried to transform its copyright laws for the digital age, that's exactly what happened - and MEPs rejected the directive on copyright.

So what was the problem? It all came down to just two small parts of the proposed text.

Article 13, critics claimed, would have made it nearly impossible to upload even the tiniest part of a copyrighted work to Facebook, YouTube, or any other site.

That would have meant no more stills from movies, no more song remixes, and the danger of constant blocks by automatic systems getting it wrong.

Article 11, the other controversial part, might have made linking harder because it would have given news publishers better control over their content.

All this led to more than 800,000 signatures on a petition against the proposals by the time the vote came - and MEPs, it seems, heard the outcry.

But the EU commissioner behind the proposed law had rubbished critics' objections, and it had the support of newspapers and many top musicians.

So what, exactly, were the concerns?

Article 13 - the 'upload filter'

Article 13 was all about the ""use of protected content"" by sharing services.

In a nutshell, it said that any website which ""gives the public access to copyright protected works... uploaded by its users"" had to get permission from whoever owned the copyright - probably through a licensing agreement.

If it didn't have that permission, the site would need to block it.

This seems straightforward - that copyright owners (including ordinary people who take a great photo, for example) should be paid for their work, and have control over where it appears.

Many opponents agreed that this was a good idea. But the proposals put the onus on websites to check everything uploaded by users. That's impossible for humans to do.

On YouTube, for example, 400 hours of video are uploaded every single minute - a volume that can't be managed by real people.

The proposed law allowed for exemptions for small businesses, but everyone else would almost certainly have needed to use an automatic system.

And that is potentially fraught with problems.

Image copyright YouTube Image caption YouTube's own platform is full of complaints about its system from its creators

YouTube already has a system to scan for copyright infringement in uploaded videos automatically. But there are innumerable examples of the system getting it wrong, including:

This automated copyright system has cost YouTube at least $60m.

Critics of the proposed EU copyright rules predicted that similar expensive, imperfect systems would need to be rolled out by every website if Article 13 became law.

And that could have affected more than just video. There were fears Article 13 could place a ban on memes: those popular, recognisable images (usually from films or TV) with text emblazoned across it to express ideas.

Julia Reda, an MEP from the German Pirate Party, wrote a widely shared blog post attacking the proposal, which she described as ""upload filters, shoddily hidden"".

""Article 13 applies to every platform with an upload form and every app with a 'post' button,"" she argued. ""These filters are bound to block legitimate acts of expression... because they can't tell apart valid uses like quotation from infringement.""

And getting a licence for every type of content that exists from every publisher would be ""plainly impossible"", she said.

She's not alone. Dozens of influential technology leaders, including inventors of key internet technologies Vint Cerf and Tim-Berners Lee, rallied against Article 13.

Article 13 ""would mandate internet platforms to embed an automated infrastructure for monitoring and censorship deep into their networks,"" a joint letter said.

Those in favour of the new rules pointed out that many exemptions existed in the directive for legitimate use of material, and that there would be a complaints process.

It also had the backing of major musicians like Sir Paul McCartney, who want to see their music better protected.

But the way EU directives work means that every single country would have implemented the rules in national law the way it saw fit - and it wasn't clear how each country would define what was acceptable and what was not. Many critics felt that internet services which operate across borders would be likely to play it safe.

And unlike blocked websites, which can be circumvented using a VPN (Virtual Private Network), these checks would all have been done by on the systems of each website - and it's not clear how easy such checks would be to get around.

Article 11 - the 'link tax'

The other controversial part of the proposed law was about the ""protection of press publications"".

The intent was to protect newspapers and other outlets from the use, without payment, of their material by internet giants like Google and Facebook - again, something many people agreed was a good idea.

But the proposal said it was up to each individual country to decide what an ""insubstantial part"" of a news report would be - and anything else would need a licensing agreement.

The fear was that this could lead to problems with even the tiniest sentence fragments being used to link to other news outlets - something that many news outlets, including the BBC, does every day.

Article 11 could, critics said, cause huge problems for links on platforms like Facebook, which pulls in a ""snippet"" and thumbnail of the article to give readers some idea what the story is about.

The proposals made an exception for private, individual use - but it could be argued that anything on Facebook (or other sites that make money) is a ""commercial use"".

Wikipedia, one of the world's largest websites, has been particularly vocal about the issue.

Its co-founder Jimmy Wales took to social media campaigning against it, writing on Reddit that ""Articles 11 and 13 are nightmares"".

On another Reddit thread, Mr Wales wrote: ""Publishers, I predict, will instantly cave in and give Google and Facebook free licences... but smaller providers - dead.

""They don't have the clout to get permission to use a snippet or thumbnail, and they can't afford to pay.""

For Wikipedia, its campaigning paid off - the final version of the proposed law included an exemption for ""online encyclopaedias"" and other non-profit purposes.

But the organisation continued its campaign, arguing that ""our overarching mission is heavily dependent on a free and open internet ecosystem"".

What happens next?

The proposed directive is due to be revisited in September, with a European Parliament debate and possible changes.

It's not yet known whether Articles 11 and 13 will be removed or amended.

If eventually adopted by the European Parliament, the directive will be sent to the European Commission, which also has to approve it - a process that could take months.

Usually, the Parliament and the Commission agree - but if they don't, they'll form a committee to try and reach consensus.

Once they've both agreed and approved the directive, it has to be put into law by every member state on a country-by-country basis, in a process the EU calls transposition.

A man and woman are critically ill in hospital in Wiltshire after being exposed to the nerve agent Novichok.

The pair, Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess, fell ill at a house in Amesbury, about eight miles from Salisbury, on Saturday.

This is what we know so far.

What happened?

On Saturday, paramedics were called twice to a house in Muggleton Road in Amesbury - first at 11:00 BST after Ms Sturgess, 44, collapsed.

Medics attended again several hours later, after Mr Rowley, 45, also fell ill.

A friend of the couple, Sam Hobson, said Ms Sturgess had appeared to have a fit and was ""foaming at the mouth"".

When Mr Rowley became ill, he was sweating profusely, dribbling and his eyes were ""red, pinpricked"", Mr Hobson said.

Scientists at the UK's military research lab, Porton Down, found the couple had been exposed to the nerve agent, Novichok.

What have police said?

Wiltshire Police said it was initially believed the two patients had been using heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs.

But, after more tests, police declared a major incident and counter-terror police are now leading the investigation.

Officers said no one had presented with the same symptoms and there was ""nothing in their background"" to suggest Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess were targeted.

Six areas in Amesbury and Salisbury are cordoned off.

What is the line of inquiry?

Assistant Commissioner of Specialist Operations Neil Basu said that ""around 100 detectives"" from the Counter Terrorism Policing Network (CTPN) were working on the investigation, alongside Wiltshire Police.

Mr Basu added that the investigation's priority was to establish how those affected came into contact with the nerve agent.

Home Secretary Sajid Javid said that working out whether there was a connection to the attempted murders of Yulia and Sergei Skripal was ""clearly the main line of inquiry"".

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Assistant Commissioner of Specialist Operations Neil Basu speaking on Wednesday night

Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned nearby in Salisbury on 4 March.

The public could expect to see an increased police presence - including ""officers wearing protective equipment"" - at a ""number of sites"" over the coming days, Mr Basu added.

Who are the victims and where had they been?

Ms Sturgess is understood to be a mother of three and have links to John Baker House, which offers supported accommodation. It has been cordoned off by police.

A close friend of Ms Sturgess's, who lived in the same building, described her as a ""loving and caring person"" and said - contrary to previous claims - she ""never did drugs"".

Mr Hobson, who also knew the victims, said that after Ms Sturgess fell unconscious and was taken to hospital, he and Mr Rowley went to a chemist in Amesbury to collect a prescription before going to an event at a nearby Baptist church.

The two men returned to the house and planned to visit the hospital but Mr Rowley ""started feeling really hot and sweaty"" and ""acting all funny"", Mr Hobson, 29, said.

""He wasn't like he was him and he was rocking against the wall and his eyes were red, pinpricked and he started seating loads and dribbling so I had to phone an ambulance for him.""

Five areas the victims are believed to have visited prior to falling ill have been cordoned off: in Amesbury they are Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church, while in Salisbury and John Baker House in Rolleston Street and Queen Elizabeth Gardens are being checked.

What has the government said?

Prime Minister Theresa May said her thoughts were with the victims of the poisoning, adding: ""The message from Salisbury is clear - it is very much open for business.

""The government will continue to provide every support to the local community.""

Mr Javid called on Russia to explain ""exactly what has gone on"", adding: ""We will stand up to the actions that threaten our security.""

The home secretary said he was ""comfortable"" the ""exact same nerve agent"" had been used in both the Salisbury and Amesbury poisonings - but added it was not yet known they were from the same batch.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sajid Javid calls on Russia to explain ""exactly what has gone on""

What has Russia said?

The government accused Russia of being behind the poisoning of the Skripals in March, which Moscow denied, souring relations between the two countries.

In response to Mr Javid's comments that Russia needed to provide an explanation following the Amesbury incident, Russia said Mrs May's government was subjecting them ""to hell"".

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova urged police not to be led by the ""dirty political game"" and said she was confident London would have to apologise to Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, called the news ""alarming"" and said it was causing ""deep concern"".

""From the very beginning of the Salisbury story, Russia has categorically denied and continues to deny the possibility of any involvement in what happened there,"" he told state-run TV.

Is there a risk to the public?

Repeating advice from Public Health England (PHE), Mr Javid said there was ""no significant risk to the wider public"", adding: ""The risk to the public remains low.""

Security minister Ben Wallace told the BBC he could not guarantee people were ""100% safe"" from further contamination.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Security minister Ben Wallace says he cannot guarantee people are 100% safe from further contamination

Asked whether the people of Salisbury and Amesbury were at risk, Mr Wallace said the ""best intelligence officers in the world"" were working on the investigation but until the full picture of the Skripal assassination attempt was known, he could not offer complete reassurance.

He added that the ""nature of a nerve agent such as Novichok"" meant that finding other traces of it was like looking for a ""tiny needle in a haystack"".

What is the health advice?

PHE has urged anyone who may have visited the locations that have been cordoned off by police to wash and clean their clothing and personal items.

Although they said there was ""no immediate"" danger, anyone who was at the five areas between 22:00 on 29 June and 18:30 on 30 June should:

Wash the clothing they were wearing

Wipe down personal items like phones and bags with cleansing or baby wipes

Double-bag any items which are dry-clean only

The risk to the public is low, said Mike Wade, from PHE South West, adding: ""We will keep this assessment under constant review as further information becomes known.""",Amesbury Novichok poisoning: What we know so far,http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44721558

The law would have put a greater responsibility on individual websites to check for copyright infringements.

But the web's inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee and others had expressed concerns about the proposed rules, which they said threatened internet freedom.

Opponents greeted the decision as a victory.

Julia Reda, a Pirate Party MEP who had campaigned against the legislation tweeted: ""Great success: Your protests have worked! The European Parliament has sent the copyright law back to the drawing board.""

BPI Music, which represents UK record labels, had supported the bill and tweeted: ""We respect the decision... we will work with MEPs over the next weeks to explain how the proposed directive will benefit not just European creativity, but also internet users and the technology sector.""

Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales told the BBC he hoped that the music industry could find a way to compromise before the September debate.

""Don't think about filtering everything everyone uploads to the internet. That's a pipe dream but you are never going to get that,"" he said.

Instead, he added, they should look to renegotiating deals with platforms such as YouTube to get ""fairer remuneration"".

Analysis:

By Mark Savage, Music reporter

The combined clout of Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox, Placido Domingo and David Guetta wasn't enough to persuade MEPs to make sweeping changes to copyright law.

They were among 1,300 musicians who urged politicians to enact a law forcing sites like YouTube and Facebook to use filters that would stop users illegally uploading their music.

Musicians were being cheated out of money, they argued, even though websites were making huge profits off their work.

Critics said the laws would stifle creativity - with Creative Commons chief Ryan Merkley observing that The Beatles would have been prevented from performing cover versions under the proposed rules.

For you and me, it could have resulted in text, music and videos posted to blogs, social networks and comment sections being yanked from the net at point of upload - somewhat like YouTube's controversial Content ID system on steroids.

In the end, MEPs decided the changes needed more debate; and sent the proposals back to Parliament. The two sides will undoubtedly step up their campaigns in the meantime.

What were they voting for?

The Copyright Directive is intended to bring rules around content in line with the digital age.

The two most controversial parts of it are Article 11 and Article 13.

The first of these is intended to provide fair remuneration for publishers and prevent online content-sharing platforms and news aggregators sharing links without paying for them. But it has been called the ""link tax"" by opponents and raised questions about who will have to pay and how much.

Article 13 puts more onus on websites to enforce copyright laws and could mean that any online platform that allows users to post text, images, sounds or code will need a way to assess and filter content.

Who supported it?

Supporters of the rule changes say they would improve copyright rules, giving intellectual-property protection to news and video content.

On Wednesday, Sir Paul McCartney wrote to MEPs urging them to vote in favour of the changes.

""Today, some user-upload content platforms refuse to compensate artists and all music creators fairly for their work while they exploit it for their own profit,"" reads the letter.

""The proposed Copyright Directive and its Article 13 would address the value gap and help assure a sustainable future for the music ecosystem and its creators, fans and digital music services alike.""

Centre-right German MEP Axel Voss was in charge of pushing through the legislation and recently published a video intended to counter what he called ""fake news"" about the legislation.

Who opposed it?

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jimmy Wales has called the legislation ""disastrous""

Critics claim that Article 13 could have a massive impact on how people use the internet, putting paid to memes and remixes.

In particular there are concerns that it will require websites to scan all content being uploaded, automatically blocking anything that might infringe copyright.

The use of artificial intelligence in filters could mean they will not be able to distinguish between content that infringes copyright and fair use, such as satire and memes, they say.

A petition against the change - known as Save Your Internet - had gained 750,000 signatures.

And a letter signed by 70 influential technology leaders, including Vint Cerf and Tim Berners-Lee, described it as an ""imminent threat to the future"" of the internet.

Italy Wikipedia shut down for a day earlier this week in protest at the plans, which co-founder Jimmy Wales has described as ""disastrous"".

The editors wrote that ""Wikipedia itself would be at risk of closing"".

At the time, they said: ""If the proposal is approved, it may be impossible to share a newspaper article on social networks or find it on a search engine.""",MEPs reject controversial copyright law,http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44712475/#comp-comments-button

Actors have vented their fury at two audience members who watched England's World Cup penalty shoot-out on their phones in the front row of a musical.

Titanic The Musical actor Niall Sheehy said the women ""not only followed the penalty shootout on their phone, but also said 'yesss' on each goal scored"".

He declared: ""You are the most ignorant audience members I have ever had the misfortune to perform in front of.""

The match clashed with a performance at Nottingham Theatre Royal on Tuesday.

The game's dramatic climax saw England beat Colombia in the last 16 and progress to the quarter-finals.

But some audience members couldn't resist keeping up with the match on their phones, despite having a different kind of drama unfolding on stage.

Sheehy added that a cast member signalled to the women to put their phone away, but they just ""smiled, gave a thumbs up and replied 'I know - we won!!'""

He concluded: ""I think you may have let us all know you are the stupidest woman on the planet. Please avoid attending any future theatrical productions.""

One theatregoer wrote to a cast member saying: ""I feel I need to apologise on behalf of the appalling lady in the front centre of the stalls who could not stay off her phone.

""I can assure you she doesn't represent the way people usually behave at @RoyalNottingham.""

Some Twitter users had sympathy for the women, however. One wrote: ""Oh no... Showing a bit of passion for their team in a BIG match!

""Shame on them for doing it during the show but c'mon sometimes human nature has a desire to do things that aren't intentionally bad willed.""

In a statement, the theatre said its front of house team told every audience member to switch off their phones as they entered the auditorium, and that a duty manager was in the stalls but wasn't aware of any disturbance.

""It would seem that these two audience members seated on the front row, only a few feet away from the stage, perhaps had not realised that their actions could be both seen and heard,"" the statement said.

""Even if audience members feel that they are being quiet or discreet in checking their phones during a performance, it is both disrespectful and distracting to the actors on stage and to the other people around them.

""Our staff are vigilant in stopping this kind of behaviour, where it is practical to do so without further distracting from the action on stage, but we do also rely on people using courtesy and respect to those around them when they come to see a live theatre performance.""

They will hope audience members resist the temptation to follow England's next match against Sweden at 15:00 BST on Saturday - which coincides with the touring musical's matinee performance.

A black Democratic politician in the US state of Oregon says the police were called on her while she was out campaigning for re-election.

Janelle Bynum was knocking on doors in Clackamas County on Tuesday when a patrol car pulled up alongside her.

In a Facebook post, she said one of her constituents had thought she was acting suspiciously and called the police.

""I was going door to door and spending a lot of time typing on my cell phone... aka canvassing,"" she wrote.

""I asked to meet my constituent who thought I was suspicious, but she was on the road by then.""

Ms Bynum, who is hoping to win a second term in the Oregon House of Representatives later this year, then asked the officer to call the constituent.

The woman said she had alerted the police ""for the safety of her neighbourhood"" and quickly apologised.

""It was just bizarre,"" Ms Bynum told The Oregonian newspaper.

""It boils down to people not knowing their neighbours and people having a sense of fear in their neighbourhoods, which is kind of my job to help eradicate.""

""It's important for people to feel like they can talk to each other to help minimise misunderstandings,"" she added.

The incident is the latest example of alleged racial profiling in the US to be widely shared on social media.

A white woman faced widespread criticism earlier this year after calling the police about a black family who were having a barbeque.

Facebook's algorithms have ruled that parts of the US Declaration of Independence are hate speech and removed excerpts of them posted to the platform.

In the run-up to Independence Day, a US community paper based in Texas had been posting small daily chunks of the historic document on its Facebook page.

At issue was a part of it that referred to ""merciless Indian savages"".

Facebook later apologised and allowed the posting.

The Liberty County Vindicator had been sharing excerpts from America's founding document to its Facebook page in an attempt to encourage historical literacy among its readers.

Part 10 did not appear, with the paper receiving a notice from Facebook saying the post went against its standards on hate speech.

Editor Casey Stinnett wrote afterwards of the offending paragraph: ""Perhaps had Thomas Jefferson written it as 'Native Americans at a challenging stage of cultural development' that would have been better.

""Unfortunately, Jefferson, like most British colonists of his day, did not hold an entirely friendly view of Native Americans.""

The newspaper later confirmed that Facebook had had a change of heart and apologised.

""It looks like we made a mistake and removed something you posted on Facebook that didn't go against our community standards,"" the company told the Vindicator.

Once upon a time on a plane to Dallas, Rosey Blair and her boyfriend asked a young woman if she would swap seats so that they could sit together.

When the woman obliged, the two joked that her new seat partner might end up being the love of her life.

As Rosey and her boyfriend made themselves comfortable in the seats directly behind, they witnessed a young man make his way to the vacant seat.

Who was this man, and had Rosey's request to swap seats really triggered a twist of fate that would bring two hearts together? Yes, Rosey had decided, plus it was probably a good way to pass time on the flight.

What unfolded was documented on Rosey's Instagram story and then uploaded as a thread to Twitter.

Littered with emojis and captions her simple but gripping love story, that could be called ""Catching Flights And Feelings,"" captured the hearts of thousands of social media users.

Retweeted more than 238,000 times and liked almost 600,000 times since being posted on 3 July, the tale of two people sitting on a plane together began to gather pace.

Social media users following the developments demanded to know what was going on and Rosey obliged.

Eating nuts regularly could improve sperm health, a study suggests.

Men who ate about two handfuls of mixed almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts daily for 14 weeks improved their sperm count and had more viable ""swimmers"", scientists found.

The study comes amid a decline in sperm counts across the Western world, linked to pollution, smoking and diet.

Researchers said there was growing evidence a healthy diet could boost the odds of conceiving.

About one in seven couples have difficulty getting pregnant and about 40-50% of cases of infertility are attributable to men.

The scientists randomly divided 119 healthy men between the ages of 18 and 35 into two groups:

One added 60 grams (2oz) of nuts a day to their normal diet

One made no changes to what they ate

Image copyright Getty Images

Those in the nut group improved sperm:

count by 14%

vitality by 4%

motility (movement) by 6%

morphology (shape and size) by 1%

All of these are the parameters the World Health Organization lists as measurements of sperm quality and are associated with male fertility.

Experts said the study backed up others that showed a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants and the B vitamin folate improved fertility.

Nuts contain many of these and other nutrients.

""Evidence is accumulating in the literature that healthy lifestyle changes such as following a healthy dietary pattern might help conception,"" said Dr Albert Salas-Huetos, from the Universitat Rovira i Virgili, in Spain, who led the study.

'Interesting academically'

However, researchers cautioned that these men were healthy and apparently fertile, so it was not clear whether the findings would apply to the wider population, including men with fertility problems.

Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, who was not involved in the research, said it was also possible that men in the nut group might have made other positive changes to their lives not taken into account by the study.

Dr Virginia Bolton, formerly consultant clinical embryologist at Guy's Hospital in London, said the findings were ""interesting academically"" but it was impossible to say what effect they would have in terms of boosting the chances of pregnancy.

She added: ""But meanwhile, until we get the answers to the questions, we should all be encouraging all of our patients to stop drinking alcohol, stop smoking, eat healthily, all of the standard things.""

The results of the study are being presented at the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Barcelona.

What happens when the world's two biggest economies go to war?

Ok, so it's not a real war - but the US and China are at the beginning of a trade war - and no-one knows just how bad it could get.

So here's how a US-China trade war could hurt us.

Tit-for-tat

A list of Chinese products will be hit with a 25% tariff from Friday - effectively making them 25% more expensive for US consumers.

Technology goods like Chinese-made semiconductor chips. They're found in consumer products used in everyday life such as televisions, personal computers, smartphones, and cars

A wide variety of products ranging from plastics, nuclear reactors and dairy-making equipment

According to the Petersen Institute of International Economics more than 90% of the products on the US tariffs list are made up of intermediate inputs or capital equipment. That means stuff that you need as raw material to make other products - so it could have a knock-on effect on many other goods too.

What the US really wants to target though are things produced under China's Made in China 2025 policy.

In retaliation to the US moves, China has hit these sectors:

American agriculture - hitting at American farmers and ranchers, a political vote bank that US President Trump relies on. Some 91% of the 545 products China is placing a tariff on are from the agriculture sector

The car sector - companies such as Tesla and Chrysler manufacture in the US and their products going into China would be affected

Medical products; coal; petroleum (but only marginally).

'Getting scary'

And while Beijing is really good at the chest-thumping, fist-wagging rhetoric, the reality on the ground is much more serious.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What is Beijing planning with its ""Made in China 2025"" programme?

""Our industry contacts in China have said things like 'seems pretty serious,' or 'this is getting scary', even 'I think there's a chance of things getting worse',"" says Vinesh Motwani of Silk Road Research.

He's recently returned from a trip to the mainland, and as part of his research routinely talks to China-based firms to gauge business sentiment there.

These worries, he says, can translate into ""increased caution and lower confidence"" for businesses as they try to navigate the uncertainty ahead.

Which means: expansion plans could be put on ice. And if Chinese expansion is on hold that has a direct impact on the rest of us in Asia.

Shift manufacturing?

Obviously the US and China's economies are most at risk, although they're not the only ones.

According to DBS's chief economist Taimur Baig, an all-out trade war could shave 0.25% off the GDP of both economies this year. It gets much worse next year - with both countries seeing a reduction in growth of about 0.5% or more.

Mr Baig adds that ""considering China grows at 6-7% and the US at 2-3%, we believe the damage would be greater to the US than on China"".

But countries like South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan could all be affected too because of disruption to supply chains.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why the US-China trade war will hit most of our pockets

China sources a lot of components that go into its finished goods from these other countries. As Nick Marro of the Economist Intelligence Unit points out, ""any dent in China's export flows will inevitably affect"" these other countries.

The case could be made for manufacturing to shift to these other countries - and for them to take advantage of selling to the US - but that shift would take time, and it's hard to see who could match China's scale.

Ultimately, the US consumer will end up paying more for these products.

China backlash

US firms operating in China could also face a ""China backlash"".

Elon Musk's electric car firm Tesla, for instance, has already highlighted just how important the Chinese market is to it.

But it imports all of its products to China and so would see a 25% tariff placed on its cars sold in China - on top of the 15% tax imported vehicles already face there.

This would inevitably push up prices for Tesla in China, making its vehicles less competitive than they already are, relative to others.

Sino-US tensions could also end up ""delaying or preventing"" Tesla's ability to release its full potential in China, according to Silk Road Research.

How bad can it get?

It's the question I ask every business person I meet, and the answer is typically always the same: nobody knows.

If history is any guide, then past trade wars have led to deep economic malaise. In particular the US Smoot-Hawley tariffs enacted in 1930 are thought to have inspired a trade war, and led to a massive decline in global trade.

As one study points out, world trade fell by 66% from 1929 to 1934, while US exports and imports to and from Europe each also fell by about two-thirds.

While no one is saying we're there yet, businesses are getting more concerned than they have been in the past, especially because of all the uncertainty.

The tit-for-tat mentality between Beijing and Washington could just end up antagonising both sides to a point where they cannot climb down from their hostile positions for fear of losing face.

""You start with protectionism and isolationism,"" says Victor Mills, chief executive of Singapore's International Chamber of Commerce. ""And then you don't just beggar your neighbour, you beggar yourself.""

What many business people are hoping of course, is that this sound and fury is just the start of another series of negotiations.

But the worry is that if it's not - it will escalate, and everybody will be the poorer. And that includes you and me.",How a US-China trade war could hurt us all,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-44706880

Internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom has lost his latest court battle against extradition from New Zealand to the US.

New Zealand's Court of Appeal upheld the decision that Mr Dotcom and three others can be extradited to stand trial for copyright infringement and fraud.

The charges are related to Mr Dotcom's now defunct file-sharing website Megaupload, which allowed millions of people to download digital content.

Mr Dotcom and his co-accused have consistently denied the US charges.

It is now up to New Zealand's Justice Minister Andrew Little to decide whether extradition should take place.

Mr Dotcom and his co-accused have one final legal option.

""We will seek review with the NZ Supreme Court,"" his lawyer Ira Rothken tweeted.

The US claims that Kim Dotcom, Mattias Ortmann, Bram van der Kolk and Finn Batato were involved in a worldwide criminal organisation that lost copyright holders more than an estimated $500m (£378m).

A woman working at Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand has been arrested for allegedly selling a 14-day-old baby.

Two other women employees from the centre have been detained and are being questioned about other possible cases.

Police took action after the state's Child Welfare Committee (CWC) registered a complaint.

The charity has not responded to BBC requests for comment.

""We have found out that some other babies have also been illegally sold from the centre,"" a police official told BBC Hindi's Niraj Sinha. ""We have obtained the names of the mothers of these babies and are further investigating.""

Police also recovered 140,000 rupees ($2,150; £1,625) from the centre, which is located in Jharkhand's capital, Ranchi.

India's changing adoption rules

By Jill McGivering, BBC News

Legally adopting a baby in India can take from a few months to years. Each year, only a few thousand adoptions are formalised - a fraction of the number of those wanting to adopt. Informal estimates of the number of children who are abandoned or unwanted run into tens of thousands.

In October 2015, the government changed the rules. It took the system online, with a national database of available children. Supporters say this made the process faster and more transparent and allowed prospective parents to find children anywhere in the country.

But some adoption agencies opposed the changes, which reduced their involvement in the process of matching couples and children. The Missionaries of Charity ended its own involvement because it opposed adoptions to single women or unmarried couples.

There's a long-standing stigma associated with adoption in India. In the past, many were arranged informally within extended families. But concerns persist that couples wanting to adopt may find it easier to turn to the black market and adopt directly from hospitals or orphanages which are not part of the legal system. This may also fuel the trade in child trafficking, still a major concern in India.

""We are currently investigating the sale of a newborn baby to a couple in Uttar Pradesh for 120,000 rupees,"" CWC chairman Rupa Kumari told the BBC.

""But the couple was told that the money was for hospital expenses.""

The baby, a boy, was born to a young woman who arrived at the charity on 19 March, and was sold to the couple on 14 May, Ms Kumari said.

Ms Kumari added that the committee should have been informed when the pregnant woman was taken to hospital. She said the committee had discovered that other babies were sold to people in different cities for 50,000-70,000 rupees.

The CWC has transferred 13 pregnant women who were living in the missionary's Ranchi centre to a different location.

Prospective parents have been known to buy babies illegally in India because of the tough laws and long wait to adopt. During the 2015-2016 financial year, there were only 3,011 legal adoptions, against a waiting list of 12,000 couples.",Mother Teresa India charity 'sold babies',http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44722755

Rescuers are racing against the rains to free 12 boys and their football coach, who are trapped in a flooded cave in northern Thailand.

A deluge is expected to hit in a matter of days that could force the water level up, threatening to flood the pocket where the group took refuge.

The teenage boys and their 25-year-old coach have been trapped for 12 days.

They were found on Monday night by rescue divers, on a rock shelf about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth.

The boys have now received food, foil blankets, and medical attention, and rescuers are trying to run cables through the cave tunnel so they can speak to their families.

When are the rains coming?

The region of Chiang Rai where the boys are trapped has for the past few days experienced a dry spell, and rescuers have taken advantage of this to pump water out of the cave complex.

About 128 million litres of water had been pumped out by Thursday, with the water levels coming down at an average rate of 1.5cm per hour. Rescue workers are now able to walk through a 1.5km (0.9 mile) stretch from the entrance to what's being called the third chamber.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Water is being pumped out of the cave complex around the clock

But heavy monsoon rains are forecast for Sunday. Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osotthanakorn said they were ""racing against water"".

""We are calculating how much time we have it if rains, how many hours and days,"" he said.

The Tham Luang cave complex is regularly flooded during the rainy season until September or October, raising fears that a delay could leave the boys trapped in the cave for months.

What is being done to rescue the boys?

There is hope that enough water can be pumped out of the cave tunnels for the boys to be able to wade - or be floated - out.

But rescuers are also planning for other eventualities.

A team are exploring the forested mountain land above the cave complex to see if they can find a chimney down to the cavern sheltering the boys. They have enlisted the help of bird-watchers, who are specialists in finding hidden holes, the AFP news agency reports.

Thai Navy Seal divers are also teaching the boys the basics of diving, with a view to guiding them out through flooded waters if necessary.

But such a rescue would be fraught with risk, say experts. Many of the boys cannot swim or dive, and there is a high risk they might panic in the dark, murky, narrow waterways.

The journey for the group to travel up to the cave entrance would take around five hours, rescue divers say.

The Thai military has previously said that if the boys can't dive out, the group may have to wait for up to four months for flooding to recede before they can leave.

Food and other supplies are being put in place for that eventuality.

Rescue teams are working in extremely difficult conditions. The heat has been sweltering and unrelenting, at over 30C, while much of the site is submerged in squelchy mud that is several inches thick in places and extremely slippery.

But the work has continued at an unrelenting pace. Everyone is aware that once the monsoon rains start, rescue efforts will be much more difficult.

Meanwhile, hundreds of workers are helping to keep the site in order, with road engineers laying gravel to try and secure the mud, workers for the Thai royal kitchen providing hot food for everyone, and volunteers handing out water bottles and ice lollies to those on site.

One local civil servant, who had volunteered to help hand out supplies, said he did not know the boys personally but had decided to help because ""I consider the boys in the caves as my brothers"".

Community of hope springs up outside cave

How are the boys coping?

Video from Thai Navy special forces on Monday showed the boys looking emaciated but smiling and at times laughing.

The arrival of food, foil blankets and the prospect of speaking to their loved ones will have buoyed their spirits.

But concern is mounting for both their physical and mental health after 12 days below ground - and it is not clear how they would be helped to survive months more in the cave.

Shortly after the group's bikes were found abandoned at the entrance last month, heavy rain sent torrents of water through the cave.

Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were being monitored by the Russian authorities in the months before their poisoning, BBC Newsnight understands.

The government alleged, in a letter to Nato, that the Russian authorities had hacked into Yulia's email account in 2013.

I understand briefings given to UK ministers and allied governments suggested it went well beyond this.

Sergei and his daughter were poisoned in Salisbury in March.

With the police investigation not saying whether it has identified any suspects, four months after the Salisbury incident, the UK government's case against Russia is still based largely on secret intelligence.

Both former spy Sergei, and his daughter, had been monitored for some time before March this year - something found out after the poisoning.

Yulia's mobile phone has since been closely studied for signs of malware that could have allowed it to be used to track her whereabouts.

Questions remain though about whether any of the surveillance of her and her father was detected before the attempt, and should have prompted an increased level of protection.

The other main reason why the government blamed Russia rests with the identification of so-called Novichok nerve agent and its specific chemical properties.

Experts from the OPCW international watchdog were invited to Salisbury to take samples in late March.

They confirmed the UK's identification of the agent in the unclassified section of their report, which emphasised the high purity of the agent used to poison the Skripals.

Image copyright PA Image caption Investigators in hazmat suits walk near where Sergei and Yulia were found

I understand that the classified section goes into further detail both about the purity and persistence of the poison.

From this, it was deduced that the Novichok was produced by people employing a high level of skill in a very advanced laboratory.

The inference was that the nerve agent could only have come from one or two labs in the world.

Novichok agents were developed in the last days of the USSR, at the Shikhany facility in southern Russia.

My meetings with Sergei Skripal

I met Sergei on a few occasions last summer and found him to be a private character who did not, even under the circumstances then prevailing, wish to draw attention to himself.

He agreed to see me as a writer of history books rather than as a news journalist, since I was researching one on the post-Cold War espionage battle between Russia and the West.

Information gained in these interviews was fed into my Newsnight coverage during the early days after the poisoning. I have not felt ready until now to acknowledge explicitly that we had met, but do now that the book is nearing completion.

As a man, Sergei is proud of his achievements, both before and after joining his country's intelligence service.

He has a deadpan wit and is remarkably stoical given the reverses he's suffered in his life; from his imprisonment following conviction in 2006 on charges of spying for Britain, to the loss of his wife Liudmila to cancer in 2012, and the untimely death of his son Alexander (or Sasha) last summer.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Sergei Skripal is pictured here in a court in Moscow in 2006

His domestic routine appeared settled and quiet, with regular visits to the cemetery, favourite shops, and lately the Railway Social Club.

Certainly he did not seem to feel himself under great threat.

Sergei's Salisbury life might be best described as semi-retired, since he was making occasional trips to lecture or advise friendly intelligence services. But this appeared to be a standard arrangement with defectors, the former KGB man Oleg Gordievsky similarly giving talks to MI6 training courses and foreign agencies.

One theory that investigators are probing is that Russia's spies might have regarded Skripal's activities of this kind as evidence he had re-entered the espionage world.

Both he and his daughter must now make difficult decisions about their future.

Yulia has spoken about her hopes of returning to Russia ""one day"". Her visit in March was only supposed to last a fortnight but now it is unclear what will become of her. Certainly, she is committed for the time being to helping in her father's recovery.

For Sergei the equation is different. He was not expecting to go back to Russia, and now he knows he will not be returning to his home in this country either. His house in Salisbury has been bought by the government both as a crime scene and a place still in need of extensive decontamination.

Will he make a new life under an assumed identity in the US or a Commonwealth country?

That promises to be an extremely difficult decision.

Certainly in US witness protection schemes, people are often asked to cut themselves adrift completely from their past. Having seen the peaceful life that he was enjoying in Salisbury last summer, I would imagine that will be very hard for Sergei.

From the UK government point of view there is both an acknowledgement that Sergei and Yulia will be free to make their own choices and but also a hope that these will not trigger further political rows with Russia.

The saga of Alexander Litvinenko, killed by polonium poisoning in 2006, shows though that those in government who want to move on from the Skripal affair may not have things all their own way.

In the Litvinenko case, a police arrest warrant for the suspected poisoner, seven months after the deed, reignited the row. Should the police name suspects for Salisbury in the coming months, either in the poisoning or the surveillance of the Skripals that preceded it, then the issue will return to the world's front pages.

The stories may be fun, but there is some serious money to be made from children's TV programmes.

For the shows that catch the imagination of kids around the world, pots of cash can be made, not only from the programmes itself, but from toys, merchandising, clothes, books, theme parks, and stage shows.

But for every idea that turns into a global phenomenon like Octonauts or Peppa Pig, there are thousands of talking animals that don't make the grade.

So how do you make sure your cute creatures become a monster hit?

The builder

Keith Chapman is an unassuming millionaire. He is the man who came up with the concept of Paw Patrol, the global smash for young children. He also dreamt up Bob the Builder, a $5bn (£3.7bn) franchise which is getting on for two decades old, and still pulling in young fans.

Paw Patrol follows the adventures of a group of talking animated puppies, who also drive emergency vehicles.

Image copyright Alamy Image caption Keith Chapman unleashed both Bob the Builder and Paw Patrol on the world

The denizens of Adventure Bay call on the Paw Patrol whenever they get into scrapes, which needless to say, is every episode. The puppies seem to spend quite a lot of time rescuing the Mayor's pet chicken.

Mr Chapman came up with the idea for Paw Patrol after being approached by Canadian toy company Spin Master, which wanted to develop a kids TV franchise evolved from ideas they had for an existing franchise called ""Bakugan"".

Spin Master wanted to take the idea a stage further with a transforming toy based on emergency vehicles.

Mr Chapman came up with Robbie and the Rescue Dogs - a group of puppies with different skills sets, led by a boy.

In each episode, the pup's leader Ryder briefs the pups using a kind of jazzed-up PowerPoint presentation, and then decides which pups to send to sort out the problem.

They slide out of their helter-skelter to a pounding rock theme tune, drop into their transformed emergency vehicles, and away they go.

It takes a lot of effort to produce each episode. The number of animators has increased to around 150, and the franchise is worth more than $1bn each year to Spin Master, the BBC understands, including licensing, toys and other spin-offs.

Mr Chapman has had not one, but two global kids' TV hits, as Bob the Builder has also been a world-wide runaway success.

He tested Bob the Builder at the time on his sons - and can now test out new ideas on his baby daughter Daisy with his girlfriend Emily.

So what makes a kids' show so popular?

""If you were to sit there and throw it into a cauldron, this magic formula… You need great characters, hero characters,"" Mr Chapman says.

Also, don't underestimate your audience, he adds.

""Kids are much smarter than we think. If you don't keep them entertained and glued to the screen - that's where you fall down.

""You need the heart [of the show] to be strong. You've got to have an emotional hook. It's all light and dark. You've got to have emotional moments. It's almost a reflection of real life.""

But it helps if you have access to cash to begin with, he says.

""Really it's just being prepared to invest. The best animators, the best script writers, the best music - then you stand a chance of success.""

Earth Buddy

The founders of Spin Master got their first big break selling toy heads made of nylon stockings stuffed with sawdust that grew grass seed hair.

Initial success with the ""Earth Buddy"" let Spin Master diversify into toy aircraft. It later bought model construction firm Meccano, and now owns brands including Hatchimals.

Image copyright Spin Master Image caption Ronnen Harary says he isn't the inspiration for the Ryder character in Paw Patrol, but no-one believes him.

Ronnen Harary is the billionaire co-founder and co-chief executive of Spin Master, who entirely coincidentally happens to look very like the Ryder character in Paw Patrol.

Was Mr Harary the inspiration for the character? ""Why dispel the myth?"" he says. ""I've denied it, but no one believes me.""

The success of Paw Patrol is down to many factors, he says, including ""love"", talented production staff, and luck.

""Paw Patrol was created collaboratively and with a lot of love. With love comes attention to detail… Carefully thinking through every aspect increases a property's odds for success significantly.""

It's primarily the content of the show that resonates with kids, he says.

""The premise of the show is all about teamwork and collaboration. Every episode there is a situation that needs to be solved.

""Every episode the Pups go out and do good. It's universal messaging liked and loved around the world.""

But shows must be original, he says.

""The commonality we find with highly successful children's animation is that the storytelling is vibrant,"" he says. ""The key components: fantastic writing, directors, voice talent, storyboard artists, must be there.

""That is where the similarity [between hit shows] stops. The stories are all dramatically different with distinct characters, pacing, styles, tone and messaging. If a show is replicating another show, the odds of success are reduced to single digits,"" he adds.

Collaboration is key to getting the shows seen by large audiences, too. Spin Master managed to strike good partnerships, and started working with ""preschool powerhouse"" Nickelodeon early on in developing Paw Patrol, he says.

Nickelodeon is a kids' cable TV brand owned by Viacom, and is responsible for global smashes such as Dora the Explorer.

The partnership helped Spin Master promote Paw Patrol, and the show was able to use Nickelodeon's global licensing infrastructure, he says. Paw Patrol now airs in more than 160 countries and territories.

Adventures in Asia

Children's TV is a global business, and the more different countries you can sell your product, the more money you make.

Like most of the industry, Silvergate Media, the company behind Octonauts and Peter Rabbit, has been targeting the vast consumer markets of Asia.

Image copyright Silvergate Media Image caption Peter Rabbit is big in Japan

Peter Rabbit is ""loved particularly in the English-speaking world, led by the UK where our revenues have more than doubled in the past two years,"" says Ron Allen, Silvergate Media vice president.

But the biggest market for the quintessentially British creation Peter Rabbit, though, is… Japan.

""Beatrix Potter and Peter Rabbit have over 98% brand awareness [in Japan],"" says Mr Allen.

""Our licensing programme there includes one of the biggest consumer promotions in kids licensing with the Bank of Mitsubishi, there is a Peter Rabbit-branded theme park, and even an exact reproduction of Hill Top outside Tokyo,"" says Mr Allen.

For Octonauts, however, the next adventure is an assault on the world's second largest economy, China.

Image copyright Silvergate Media Image caption The fifth season of Octonauts is being co-produced with Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.

The show follows the undersea adventures of a group of animal explorers led by polar bear Captain Barnacles, and the forthcoming fifth season of Octonauts will be produced alongside the state broadcaster, China Central Television.

CCTV is ""in a unique position to reach kids throughout China"", says Mr Allen.

""CCTV's endorsement also means our other partners in China, from broadcast to retail, are confident of Octonauts' longevity in the market,"" he says.

To reinforce their appeal in China, the fifth season will introduce a new character, a Chinese red panda called Min, and the Octonauts will go ""down the Yangtze river for the first time,"" Mr Allen says.

Rough or smooth?

The media industry, like many other sectors, has a reputation for being hard-nosed and cut-throat, and with billions of pounds at stake, it's hard not to see why.

But does that extend to kids' entertainment, despite the fluffy nature of the content?

Keith Chapman pulls no punches about the hard-nosed nature of toy sales.

""The retailers will pull you off the shelves immediately if you don't sell. It's quite ruthless. You're soon off the shelves and out of it if you're not doing well,"" he says.

Ron Allen says kids' media ""is a business, and of course commercial objectives and revenue growth matters.

""However I've been in this industry in different roles for over 20 years and I think it is still exceptionally friendly, and relationships are paramount,"" he says.

Ronnen Harary agrees. ""At the end of the day, it is the kids' entertainment industry, so we try not to take ourselves too seriously.""",How do you create a hit kids' TV show?,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-44617684

Jaguar Land Rover has warned that a ""bad"" Brexit deal would threaten £80bn worth of investment plans for the UK and may force it to close factories.

The UK's biggest carmaker, owned by India's Tata Motors, said its ""heart and soul is in the UK"".

But without frictionless trade JLR said its UK investment plans would be in jeopardy.

The warning came as Downing Street set out details of a possible post-Brexit customs arrangement.

Jaguar Land Rover chief executive Ralf Speth said: ""A bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than £1.2bn profit each year.

""As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile. We have spent around £50bn in the UK in the past five years - with plans for a further £80bn more in the next five.

""This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.""

Mr Speth said the firm urgently needs ""greater certainty"" to continue to investing heavily in the UK.

He told the Financial Times: ""If I'm forced to go out because we don't have the right deal, then we have to close plants here in the UK and it will be very, very sad. This is hypothetical, and I hope it's an option we never have to go for.""

Image copyright Getty Images

Uncertainty over Brexit, as well as the future of diesel cars, has already led the carmaker to announce a series of changes to its UK business.

At the beginning of the year, JLR said it would cut production at its plant in Halewood, Merseyside where it builds three of its Range Rover models.

In April, it decided not to renew the contracts for 1,000 temporary workers in Solihull.

Last month, JLR said it would shift production of the Land Rover Discovery SUV to Slovakia, potentially leading to some UK job losses.

However, the carmaker also said that it was investing in its Solihull site to allow it to build its new Range Rover models, some of which will be electric-powered, from 2020.

PB Balaji, chief financial officer at Tata Motors, said: ""Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Motors have always maintained that the uncertainties from Brexit are avoidable and the business seeks clarity to ensure that industry takes timely and right decisions to manage the transition.

""Additionally, Jaguar Land Rover needs free and full access to the single market beyond transition to remain competitive which we also firmly believe is in the best long term interests of the United Kingdom.

""The recent statement from JLR only reaffirms this position that a Brexit which increases bureaucracy, reduces productivity and competitiveness of the UK industry is in no-one's interest.""

Image copyright Reuters

As well as Halewood and Solihull, JLR also has a manufacturing plant in Castle Bromwich, Birmingham where it makes its Jaguar cars.

Last year, it made more than 600,000 cars, 20% of which were sold to mainland Europe, one of its biggest markets.

JLR said that it spent £5.67bn with UK suppliers of production parts during its last financial year, as well as £5.37bn with EU-based businesses.

Analysis:

Simon Jack, BBC business editor

JLR may be Indian-owned, but its brand and - as the company puts it - its heart and soul is in the UK.

It employs 40,000 people directly and 260,000 work in its supply chain. JLR's warning follows those of Airbus, BMW and Nissan who have all said further investment in the UK is ""under review"" and could be cancelled if the country leaves the EU without a deal that ensures frictionless trade.

JLR insiders say £80bn worth of future investment in the UK over the next five years ""could be lost"".

The intervention of such a major employer - which in many ways is rightly perceived as more British than the likes of BMW, Airbus and Nissan - will heap more pressure on the government ahead of a crunch meeting of government ministers on Friday. At this meeting, business hopes the government will finally settle on its own preferred version of the UK's future economic relationship with its largest market.

Business Secretary Greg Clark said the government was ""determined"" to make sure JLR could ""continue to prosper and invest in Britain"".

The Jaguar Land Rover warning follows similar statements from BMW and Airbus. However, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called these warnings ""completely inappropriate"".

Despite being (possibly) the world's cuddliest creature, the super-sweet koala is also one of the unluckiest animals on the planet.

Australia's most famous tree hugger has been ravaged by sexually transmitted disease, attacks from dogs, being hit by cars and habitat loss.

Chlamydia has spread fast in koalas, causing infertility and blindness.

But scientists say decoding the genome should lead to an effective vaccine for the STD.

In fact, researchers say they've been amazed by the information that's been hidden in the marsupial's DNA.

While they didn't find a gene for cuteness, they've worked out how koalas can survive solely on a diet of eucalyptus - which poisons most other creatures that consume it.

Genes that are switched on in the koala's ""cast-iron livers"" appear to be responsible for the ability to detoxify the leaves.

Their DNA also equips them with powerful senses of smell and taste that allow them to sniff out the leaves with the most water in them; koalas will eat only those with at least 55% water content.

However, one of the great hopes from this five-year gene project is that scientists will be able to develop a vaccine against chlamydia, something which is present in the vast majority of the species.

Chlamydia is a horrid infection in koalas.

In addition to blindness and infertility, koalas endure something called ""dirty tail"", a painful inflammation of the urinary tract that often results in the animal's death.

Researchers have tested vaccines in the past but say the new information will speed up the process.

""The genome absolutely brings a vaccine closer,"" lead author Prof Rebecca Johnson from the Australian Museum Research Institute told BBC News.

""It's really critical information to continue the development of a chlamydial vaccine.""

""If you think about the advances that have been made in human medicine following the sequencing of the genome, we're at the point in humans where you can sequence an individual and tailor-make the medicine based on their genome.

""That's now the position we are in for koalas, having all that information at our fingertips.""

Why this story matters

Image copyright Rebecca Johnson Image caption Prof Rebecca Johnson from the Australian Museum Research Institute has led the five-year project to sequence the koala genome

Koalas are recognised as an iconic species around the world - not just in Australia.

There is a great deal of anxiety about the survival of the koala because of its biological uniqueness, as a symbol for preservation and also because of their value as a tourist attraction (they're worth around A$1.5bn).

How many koalas are left?

Experts say there are around 329,000 koalas alive in Australia today, but this is just a fraction of the population that existed in the middle of the 19th century. Demand for their furs saw millions killed between 1870 and the late 1920s. Since then, they have been classed as ""vulnerable"" by the Australian government.

The clearing of woodland habitats that koalas favour to make way for settlements, collisions with road vehicles and increased stress from climate change are among the pressures that arise from human activity.

What is a genome?

A genome is the biological set of instructions required to make you, me and every living thing, including koalas. It is written in a chemical code called DNA. Genes are short sections of this DNA which serve as the templates for proteins.

Humans have around 20,000 genes, but the koala genome is slightly larger. The genome contains all the information needed to build a person, including obvious traits such as their hair and eye colour.

Will genetics protect koalas?

The koala is also a test case for the use of genetic information as a means of conserving species. As well as helping scientists develop new vaccines for diseases like chlamydia, understanding the koala's genetic make-up will allow researchers to compare different populations.

This could perhaps help them move some creatures to prevent inbreeding and assist them with developing more effective immune systems against major threats.

Is promiscuity the cause of koala chlamydia?

Yes and no. Female koalas are highly promiscuous, while males spend a lot of their (few) waking hours fighting with others for the right to mate. Most males have scars from their battles on their arms, faces and ears. Koalas also inherit chlamydia, catching it while they are developing in their mum's pouch.

Can humans catch chlamydia from koalas?

The most common and deadly strain of chlamydia that affects koalas is different to the one that hits humans. Despite the urban myth that members of One Direction had contracted the illness from the animals during a photo shoot in Australia, there are no documented cases of humans catching chlamydia from the cuddly critters.

Are koalas the sleepiest animal on Earth?

The are one of the main contenders for the title. The creatures have developed hard cartilage along their back. Over time, this becomes a groove that lets them wedge their bottoms into the fork of a tree.

Which is just as well, since Koalas sleep for up to 19 hours a day. They spend the rest of the time eating, and about four minutes a day travelling!

What about baby koalas?

The researchers have learned how baby koalas survive being born without an immune system. The youngsters are born after just 35 days gestation and are roughly the size of a kidney bean.

They gain protection against infections through their mother's milk. Genes allow koala mums to fine-tune milk protein production for different stages of development during the six months the baby will spend in her pouch.

Where can you see them?

You can find koalas in eucalyptus forests all along Australia's Great Dividing Range which runs along the whole of the east coast of Australia with populations in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.

In Queensland, you can hold a koala, but in New South Wales you can only pat them. Outside Australia you'll find koalas in zoos in places as diverse as San Diego, Budapest and Edinburgh.

What does the future hold for koalas?

The scientists also say that having advanced genetic information will benefit long term conservation efforts. Koala numbers are set to shrink considerably in the next few years. ""Some populations are set to decline up to 50% in the next three koala generations, which is only 20 years,"" says Prof Rebecca Johnson.

The team members hope that the genetic information can be used to move koala populations around, helping them resist disease and avoid inbreeding.

Are koalas dangerous?

They might look fluffy and cute, but they have been known to bite and have sharp claws.

""You probably want to stay away from them and admire them from afar,"" says Prof Johnson. ""I wouldn't want to pick a wild one up under any circumstances. I don't think they'll thank you for it.""",Saving koalas: Gene study promises solution to deadly sex disease,http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-44646427

The home secretary has accused Russia of using Britain as a ""dumping ground for poison"" after a second incident involving the nerve agent Novichok.

Charlie Rowley, 45, and Dawn Sturgess, 44, collapsed at a house in Amesbury, Wiltshire, on Saturday and remain critically ill.

Sajid Javid said the agent was the same as that used on ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in March.

Russia said Theresa May's government was subjecting them ""to hell"".

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova urged police not to be led by the ""dirty political game"" and said she was confident London would have to apologise to Russia.

In a statement to MPs, Mr Javid said: ""It is now time that the Russian state comes forward and explains exactly what has gone on.""

He said the ""strong working assumption"" was that the couple came into contact with the nerve agent in a different location to the sites which had been part of the clean-up operation in near-by Salisbury after the Skripal poisoning.

""It is completely unacceptable for our people to be either deliberate or accidental targets, or for our streets, our parks, our towns, to be dumping grounds for poison,"" he added.

He said he could not rule out the possibility that the Novichok found in Amesbury was from the same batch used in the Salisbury attack.

""We cannot attribute this to the same batch at this point and scientists will be looking into that,"" he said.

""I'm also told that may not even be possible because of a number of factors, but we cannot rule out, of course, that it was from the same batch.""

BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the most likely hypothesis was that the Novichok was left over from the attack on the Skripals.

Earlier, Mrs May said it was ""deeply disturbing"" to see two more people exposed to Novichok in the UK, and the police would leave ""no stone unturned in their investigation"".

Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said British streets must not be allowed to become ""killing fields for state actors"".

What happened?

Image copyright Reuters

On Saturday, paramedics were called twice to a house in Muggleton Road in Amesbury - first at 11:00 BST after Ms Sturgess collapsed, then later the same day, after Mr Rowley also fell ill.

Wiltshire Police said it was initially thought the two patients had been using heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs.

In the early hours of Wednesday police declared a ""major incident"" after revealing the couple had been exposed to an ""unknown substance"".

By late that evening, Scotland Yard said Novichok was to blame following analysis at the defence research facility at Porton Down, Wiltshire.

What do we know about the couple's movements?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A friend of Charlie Rowley describes the symptoms he witnessed

Partners Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess spent Friday afternoon and evening visiting shops in Salisbury, the city where Mr Skripal and his daughter were poisoned.

The following day Ms Sturgess, who is understood to be a mother of three, was taken away on a stretcher by an ambulance crew.

Her friend Sam Hobson said she had appeared to have a fit and was ""foaming at the mouth"".

Shortly after, Mr Rowley started ""rocking against the wall"", said Mr Hobson.

""His eyes were wide open, glazed and pinpricked, and he was sweating, dribbling and making weird noises.""

Mr Hobson said the police and firefighters were in ""hazard suits"" and ""cordoned it all off"".

Ms Sturgess' father Stephen, 65, told The Times the family found out from TV news that she may have been poisoned by a nerve agent.

""We heard from the hospital on Sunday, and we gave them Dawn's GP details but we didn't hear anything from the police.

""We know as much as the next person in the street. We actually called the police station for information.""

Natalie Smyth from Amesbury said: ""I'm furious that it took four days for them [police] to even mention it could have been Novichock.""

""Were they lying to us about it being drug related?""

How did it happen?

The most likely hypothesis was that the Novichok was left over from the attack on the Skripals, says BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera.

Mr Javid said this was the ""leading line of inquiry"".

Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said they could not confirm whether the nerve agent came from the same batch but the possibility was ""clearly a line of inquiry"".

There was nothing in the couple's background to suggest the pair had been targeted, he said.

His officers are examining the couple's movements to determine where they were poisoned.

So far no contaminated items have been found and the police say they have no idea what the nerve agent was contained in.

Chemical weapons expert Richard Guthrie said it was possible that the couple came across the Novichok which poisoned the Skripals after it had been disposed of ""in a haphazard way"".

Are others at risk?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Security minister Ben Wallace says he cannot guarantee people are 100% safe from further contamination.

The risk to the general public remains low, says England's chief medical officer Sally Davies.

However, she advises people who had been in the cordoned-off areas to wash their clothes and wipe down personal items.

Residents at John Baker House, the supported housing where Ms Sturgess is believed to have been staying, have been evacuated and told they will have to be rehoused.

The police warned members of the public against picking anything up if they didn't know what it was.

Sites in Amesbury and Salisbury believed to have been visited by the couple before they fell ill have been cordoned off as a precaution, including a church, park and chemist.

This latest incident is likely to raise fears about the efficacy of a multimillion pound clean-up to decontaminate nine locations across Salisbury after the Skripal poisoning.

What's been the reaction in Russia?

There have been accusations of the UK persecuting Russia and failing to cooperate.

The Skripal case is still shrouded in darkness, says Russia spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, as she called on Theresa May's government to stop the ""dirty"" games.

She says Russia has sent ""dozens of offers of cooperation"".

Russian media: 'Groundhog Day'

By BBC Monitoring

The state media in Russia are deflecting any suggestions of a Russian link to the new poisoning.

Even before it emerged that the Novichok agent was involved, Wednesday night's primetime TV bulletins sarcastically said it was only a matter of time before Moscow gets the blame.

State-run Rossiya 1 suggested it might have been staged by the British government out of spite over the ""fabulous"" World Cup hosted by Russia.

NTV - owned by state gas giant Gazprom - called it ""another dodgy story"" from the Salisbury area, this time aimed at deterring fans from coming to Russia.

Again, it added, the British had offered no detailed evidence: ""Boris Johnson and British journalists will think up the rest.""

Channel One accused the UK of ""dragging old skeletons out of the closet"" to discredit Moscow ahead of President Vladimir Putin's upcoming summit with Donald Trump.

""Groundhog Day. New Skripals in Salisbury. Really?"" said its presenter.

Digital technology is helping to transform the lives - and profits - of farmers. From apps to the blockchain technology behind bitcoin, farmers and smallholders are discovering new ways of doing business.

Take Muhammed Adams, a cocoa farmer from Sefwi Madina in the remote western region of Ghana, who has been growing cocoa in the same way for 25 years.

Over the last couple of years, however, the Olam Farmer Information System (OFIS) run by commodities giant Olam, has helped him more than triple output - and reduce reliance on pesticides.

""Before I received my OFIS farm development plan I was harvesting seven bags of cocoa,"" Mr Adams says. ""But last year I managed 25 bags thanks to the changes I've made.""

The Olam technology puts him in direct contact with advisers. When, for example, Mr Adams has an outbreak of disease, he's learning that resorting to chemicals is not the only answer.

""The training I have received has showed me I don't need to spray my cocoa so much with pesticides, saving me a lot of money and helping me grow more cocoa,"" he says.

""The technology has really helped to bring the world closer to me.""

It's a heartening tale, given the World Economic Forum's prediction that food production must rise by 50-100% by 2050 to keep pace with population growth.

But with farming in crisis in many parts of the world, can technology really help the agricultural sector meet this seemingly unfeasible target?

Simon Brayn-Smith, head of cocoa sustainability at Olam, thinks so: ""We have really been focusing on digital initiatives over the last 18 months.""

The OFIS app collects farm data, and uses algorithms to make personalised recommendations to farmers about how to increase their yields.

Olam apps allow products to be tracked when leaving the farm, and farmers can check cocoa prices and trade online, achieving a better price for their crops.

Image copyright Olam Image caption Simon Brayn-Smith thinks the supply chain will be fully digitised within 10 years

Says Mr Brayn-Smith: ""Olam Traceability is digital-payment enabled, so we can pay farmers direct into their mobile money wallets.

""And Olam Direct, currently being piloted in Indonesia, allows us to offer farmers a much better daily price at which they can sell, say, 50kg of cocoa to us direct.""

But there is still a long way to go before smallholders can harness all the perks of the digital economy.

Most Olam apps can be run using text messaging. But ""internet coverage is still a challenge in some parts of the world, as is building local infrastructures so farmers can buy supplies digitally,"" says Mr Brayn-Smith.

Blockchain benefits

For farmers in the developing world, securing a better price is not the only benefit of linking to the digital economy.

Being paid digitally also offers smallholders the opportunity to use banking services such as savings accounts and micro-loans for the first time.

But blockchain could soon prove an even more powerful weapon in the fight against financial exclusion and exploitation, thanks to its ability to provide banks with the verifiable sales and pricing data they need to make informed lending decisions.

In Russia, farmers in Kolionovo, a town near Moscow, are already using blockchain technology.

Under the leadership of local banker-turned farmer Mikhail Shlyapnikov, they have embraced a cryptocurrency called the kolion, which is earned by helping residents with farming or construction work.

Mr Shlyapnikov started issuing paper kolions in 2014 as a means of circumventing the 12% interest charged by the banks he approached for a loan.

When a Russian court banned paper kolions in 2015, he started working on a cryptocurrency version, raising $500,000 in an initial coin offering in April 2017.

Today, there are about $2m (£1.52m) worth of kolions in circulation, backed by a reserve of 500 bitcoins (worth about £2.4m at current prices).

For most farmers, however, the full benefits of blockchain will take time to unlock.

Fair price

Christian Ferri, chief executive of BlockStar, a blockchain investment adviser, says: ""There are endless possibilities, but the technologies required might be beyond the reach of some farmers.

""The good news is that I believe we will see the cost of these technologies decrease as adoption spreads.""

Farmers in developing countries are not the only ones struggling to make ends meet.

Image copyright Rowie Meers Image caption Rowie Meers uses an app that links directly to consumers

The US Department of Agriculture predicts net farm incomes will fall 8.3% in 2018. And in the UK, farmers have long-complained about supermarkets squeezing their incomes.

Rowie Meers, who runs Purton House Organics, in Swindon, south west England, says: ""Supermarkets are continuously driving prices down, causing many smaller farms to go out of business.""

But technological innovations can also help farmers in developed countries to get a better deal.

Ms Meers uses Farmdrop, a food delivery app that uses mobile technology to link farmers directly to consumers. Producers can get 70% of the retail price, about twice the share they get from supermarkets.

More Technology of Business

Image copyright Magnum Photos

Farmdrop founder Ben Pugh says: ""The app sends real-time customer orders to 300 or so producers, who let us know what they have available and in what quantities.

""Daily harvest lists are then sent through by midday, so the producers can get the food to our hubs later that day.

""After quality control and packing, the produce is then delivered to customers' homes the following day.""

For Ms Meers, this means not having to market produce, chase payments or face the stress of unreasonable deadlines. It also means higher profits.

""We can concentrate on what we do best, growing and producing fabulous food that is genuinely freshly picked or made within hours of delivery to the end consumer,"" she says.

But the end-consumer has to be prepared to pay the price for fresh, traceable produce.

Image copyright Farmdrop Image caption Ben Pugh says Farmdrop helps return the food system to its sustainable origins

Currently only available in Greater London, Bristol and Bath, Farmdrop is estimated to be about 5% more expensive than Ocado and 10% more expensive than Sainsbury's.

However, Mr Pugh, who is planning further expansion, argues that this is the model we must adopt to help farmers.

""It's all about using technology to return our food system to its sustainable origins.""

Mr Brayn-Smith agrees. ""I think the supply chain will be fully digitised in 10 years,"" he says.

""But to achieve the uplift in incomes required to ensure cocoa farmers, for example, have a viable future, tech needs to do more than just link them to the global market.

""It needs to help them improve productivity and encourage sustainable practices, too.""",The trick that turned seven bags of cocoa into 25,http://www.bbc.com/news/business-44642175

Facebook has admitted a glitch in its network meant people who had been blocked were temporarily unblocked.

The bug, revealed by the company on Monday, affected at least 800,000 people.

It was active between between 29 May and 5 June and applied to both core Facebook and its Messenger app.

The company said it would be informing those affected with a pop-up message, starting on Monday.

“While someone who was unblocked could not see content shared with friends, they could have seen things posted to a wider audience, for example pictures shared with friends of friends,” said Facebook’s chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, in a blog post.

“We know that the ability to block someone is important - and we’d like to apologise.”

The blog post details how no friendships that had been completely severed were reinstated. Of those affected by the glitch, 83% had “only one person they had blocked temporarily unblocked”, Ms Egan wrote.

While only affecting a small percentage of Facebook’s 2.4 billion users around the world, the glitch makes troubling reading for those who use the blocking feature as a method of escaping harassment on the platform.

There's a new demand on the left. It's short, pithy and, for Democratic politicians, fraught with peril. ""Abolish Ice"".

Immigration and Customs Enforcement - Ice, for short - is the agency within the Department of Homeland Security responsible for identifying and removing undocumented aliens throughout the US. It was formed in 2003, as part of the bureaucratic reorganisation in response to the 9/11 attacks.

During the presidential campaign, Mr Trump said he wanted to create a ""deportation force"" that would crack down on US residents without proper immigration documents. It turns out there already was one - just awaiting his orders.

While border security is performed by Customs and Border Protection, Ice officers have authority throughout the US and have been the face of Donald Trump's aggressive - critics call it brutal and heartless - immigration policy.

Ice agents have separated young children from parents who enter the US illegally and have been captured on video using sometimes forceful tactics to detain and interrogate suspected undocumented immigrants. Ice detention centres have been cited by the Homeland Security inspector general for negligent practices and inadequately addressing allegations of abuse and sexual assault.

Now a growing number of activists, progressive leaders and aspiring officeholders among the progressive ranks want to do away with Ice entirely.

""We need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom, starting by replacing Ice with something that reflects our morality,"" Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said at an immigration rally in Boston on Saturday.

""Abolishing Ice"" was one of the key promises made by 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who shocked the Democratic Party by beating party stalwart Joe Crowley in his New York congressional primary last week.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ms Ocasio-Cortez protested on the US-Mexico border against the separation of children from their parents under a Trump ""zero-tolerance"" policy

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who along with Ms Warren are considered possible 2020 presidential candidates, called Ice a ""cruel deportation force"".

Democrats across the country are now being forced to go on record with their views of Ice - and whether they support the growing chorus from their base. Some are less than thrilled with the idea.

""We're going to have an agency,"" Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland said, refusing to take a definitive position on the subject. ""The question is what policy does that agency carry out?""

Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut was a bit more forceful. ""Abolishing Ice will accomplish nothing unless we change the Trump policies,"" he said on Sunday.

""You abolish Ice now, you still have the same president with the same failed policies,"" Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said. ""Whatever you replace it with is still going to reflect what the president wants to do.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'It's been 50 days since I heard of my son'

That's not good enough for ""abolish"" proponents, who believe the issue reveals a larger disagreement between the rank-and-file and the Democratic leadership.

""The call to abolish Ice is, above all, a demand for the Democratic Party to begin seriously resisting an unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state that it had a hand in creating,"" writes Sean McElwee, a co-founder of the group Abolish ICE, in the Nation magazine. ""Though the party has moved left on core issues from reproductive rights to single-payer health care, it's time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism.""

Congressman Mark Pocan, who calls Ice Mr Trump's ""personal police force"", wants a congressionally authorised commission to redefine the agency's duties and take away any powers that are susceptible to abuse by the president.

""This is a moment where this is what people want,"" says Mr Pocan. ""When you ask them, 'Do you want bold change or incremental change?' even Republicans want bold change, across all spectrums. I think sometimes the political class likes to remain safe because it keeps them in office.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hundreds of protesters took to Capitol Hill last week

His proposal sounds a bit vague - but it is about as concrete as the abolish movement gets so far.

""The reality is 'Abolish ICE' is not so much a policy proposal as a fresh cudgel to divide the Democratic Party between 'Establishment' politicians and left-wing insurgents,"" writes political analyst Bill Scher for the website RealClearPolitics. ""Anyone with the temerity to take a breath and think through the practical consequences of such a slapdash idea gets tagged with a scarlet ""E,"" as was Crowley.""

Meanwhile, Mr Trump is welcoming the recent change of focus. Two weeks ago Mr Trump and his administration faced broad, bipartisan criticism for their family separation policy, forcing the president to make a rare policy backtrack and sign an executive order temporarily suspending the practice.

He now seems practically giddy at the prospect of a debate over the future of Ice and its uniformed law enforcement officers - rather than rehashing the accounts and audio recordings of inconsolable children and their distraught parents.

""You get rid of Ice, you're going to have a country that you're going to be afraid to walk out of your house,"" Mr Trump said in an interview on Sunday. ""I love it that they're going to actually do that.""

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What do Trump supporters make of the family separations?

It's a drum he's been beating regularly on Twitter as well - yet another sign that the president plans to frame the upcoming mid-terms as a debate over law enforcement and border security versus unchecked immigration and the crime.

Skip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump The Democrats are making a strong push to abolish ICE, one of the smartest, toughest and most spirited law enforcement groups of men and women that I have ever seen.

Statistics show, however, that immigrants - whether they enter the US legally or not - commit crime at lower rates than the general population. Mr Trump disputes this fact, citing stories of Central American gangs and offering victims of undocumented criminals a platform to tell their stories.

He also paints over any nuance among Democrats who try to describe their position to ""abolish"" Ice not as a call for open borders but rather as one of reform.

And so the battle to define the debate in the weeks and months leading up to pivotal elections, which will determine which party controls the US Congress and the governorships of a handful of key states, is fully underway.

Opinion polls indicate that the American public, by and large, does not support the idea of doing away with Ice, although they also don't like many of the president's immigration policies.

If you read this blog every now and then you'll know that there has, for many, many, many months, been a row inside the Tory party over what to do about customs after we leave the EU.

It's hugely problematic, not just because this bit of Brexit policy might have a huge impact on jobs and trade after we leave, and is likely already having an impact on businesses making decisions.

But also because it directly affects the Irish border which everyone says can't return in a hard form, but no one seems to have a robust way of preventing.

News then that there is a ""new plan"", in the run-up to the prime minister's big day at Chequers, was intriguing. No 10 suggested that one of the two cabinet working groups have indeed come up with revised proposals that square the seemingly impossible triangle that Theresa May has always said she wants to keep - no hard border, smooth trade, and a British independent trade policy.

Sources suggested it is different to the two proposals put forward so far, described variously as ""unicorns"", or ""dead"" - otherwise known as the customs partnership, or maximum facilitation.

No more detail of the plan was to emerge however until nearer the cabinet's meeting on Friday when the Brexit blueprint is meant to be agreed before appearing formally in a White Paper next week, as it just so happens on the same day that President Trump is due to arrive (no news that day then).

All that Number 10 would suggest tonight is that ""at Chequers the cabinet will be asked to consider a proposal for future customs arrangements"" that will be a ""significant step forward"" from the existing two models that will ""give us the best of both worlds"".

Swiss option?

Another Whitehall source suggested that indeed there is a new plan, even if they sounded slightly less convinced than Number 10. But it is clear that near the heart of the Number 10 Brexit process, there is a move towards, as speculation has suggested, something that looks a bit less like the buccaneering Brexit of the Eurosceptics, and rather more like the softer end of fudge - with what has been described as including the single market for goods - although importantly never confirmed by government.

And the chances of the words ""single"" and ""market"" being anywhere near Theresa May's plan are as high as Boris Johnson going on a jolly holiday with Jean-Claude Juncker. It was suggested that the closest comparison to the new overall Brexit plan is a deal something like the ones that the EU has with Switzerland.

Switzerland is not in the EU, or the EEA, but EFTA, the free trade association, and has a complicated set of individual deals with the EU.

That's one of the reasons why Brussels hates it as a model. There have been, wait for it, 25 years of negotiation. And it would provide a headache here on immigration, given that Switzerland has for years been in a fight with the EU over whether it can restrict freedom of movement or not.

Many Conservatives might be extremely relieved that finally the prime minister is moving to that kind of position. Business sources say they have been reassured it's that kind of close relationship that's on the way.

But frankly, other parts of the Tory party would go bananas. And whatever the arithmetic inside the Tory party itself, where there is a majority for something at the soft end of things, there are enough Eurosceptics who could make life impossible if they really want to. If it's a Swiss style compromise that emerges there could be big trouble.

That however is for another day when the proposals actually emerge. The immediate problem with the ""new plan"", is whether or not it really exists.

Does the plan exist?

Because while Number 10 says it does, ask other people in government and they are not quite so sure. Ministers who you might have thought would be aware of the detail like - oh, you might imagine - the Brexit secretary had not agreed the lines, before Number 10 made their intervention.

And it's said tonight that the reason he has not been involved in agreeing the ""new plan"" is because it does not actually exist yet. The customs decision expected in some parts of government therefore is what has been anticipated for some time as ""max fac plus"" - a souped up version of the proposal that originally won the day in the Brexit subcommittee what feels like a lifetime ago - with, you assume, a long lead-in time while the technology is made to work.

Baffled? Quite possibly so. But it's perhaps only safe to say that four days before ministers are expected to actually make some final decisions, all is not precisely as you might have expected. Number 10 says ""we are working with ministers to finalise a third way"".

There feels still like quite some way to go.",When is a plan not a plan?,http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44690167

Melting bitumen has forced drivers in Australia to abandon their vehicles after the tyres became coated with tar.

Up to 50 motorists may be entitled to compensation over the incident in Queensland on Tuesday, reports said.

""I have never seen anything like it and when the reports started coming through yesterday, it was just incredible,"" local mayor Joe Paronella told the ABC.

The incident has been blamed on a change in weather, and damage to the road after it was resealed last week.

Local resident Deborah Stacey said ""big globs"" of tar had stuck to vehicles, amid hot weather that followed several cooler days and rain.

""We had a week of cracked windscreens... then as soon as the sun came out, it started sticking,"" she told the Courier Mail.

The tar meant tyres on several vehicles had to be replaced, and it caused damage to bumper bars and panels.

Critics have given a warm welcome to Poldark actor Aidan Turner's return to the stage after a 10-year absence, with one describing him as ""a revelation"".

Turner plays an Irish revolutionary in The Lieutenant of Inishmore.

The Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish wrote: ""Turner's intense stare carries a surprising amount of charge away from the small-screen.""

""What's more of a revelation is his capacity to turn on a sixpence between hard-man and cry-baby.""

Martin McDonagh - behind Oscar-winning film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri - wrote the 2001 play, which is directed by West End heavyweight, Michael Grandage,

Giving the play four stars out of five, Cavendish added that ""the deadpan effect"" of Turner's performance was ""at once comical and disquieting.""

The darkly comic and violent play is set in the early 1990s as the Northern Ireland peace process is taking its first steps.

Since he took on the title role in Poldark back in 2015, the focus on Turner has often - some say unfairly - on his looks rather than his talent.

The Daily Mail's Quentin Letts was just one of the critics who made reference to this in his four-star review: ""Aidan Turner plays an Irish gunman in one of the madder, braver comedies written in these islands in recent centuries. Ladies, sorry: He wears a T-shirt throughout.""

Image copyright Marc Brenner Image caption Turner hopes more stage roles will follow

The Mirror's Deirdre O'Brien also gave the play four stars and posed the question: ""Turner is a huge star, but does he have more than the ability to make hearts flutter?

""Most decidedly, yes. He shines in this gloriously gruesome and hugely enjoyable satire.""

The Sun's Benjy Potter gave McDonagh's play five stars, with the headline: ""Purrfect Turner."" (Turner's character is obsessed with his pet cat.)

Guardian critic, Michael Billington, gave the play four stars, too, lauding both Turner and the production itself.

Image copyright Marc Brenner Image caption The Lieutenant of Inishmore will run until 8 September

""The Poldark star gives an excellent performance in a first-rate revival of Martin McDonagh's brutally funny play... Turner is excellent as Padraic, and plays him not as some wild-eyed barbarian but as a man endowed with a demented innocence. ""

The Stage's Natasha Tripney, gave a slightly more lukewarm three out of five stars but still described Turner as ""impressive"".

""A white-vested Turner is impressive as Padraic, combining just the right level of charisma with a terrifying volatility and, underneath, something approaching sweetness.""

Image copyright Johan Persson Image caption Turner's character seems to have more empathy with cats than with his fellow humans

Ben Brantley reviewed the play in the New York Times, and was clearly impressed with the Irish star.

""It's the casting of Mr Turner, though, that lifts this production into its own special universe of razor-edged inanity.

""His Padraic is as smolderingly virile as his Poldark.

""With flashing eyes that tear up at the drop of a cat and a muscular frame made for monument-worthy poses, this Padraic is a strutting contradiction of attraction and repulsion, daring us to question our conventional notions of the heroic.""

The London Evening Standard's Henry Hitchings was another reviewer who gave the West End revival four stars.

""Aidan Turner, the swoon-inducing star of the BBC's Poldark, makes a magnetic West End debut in this grippingly unpleasant comedy.

""Martin McDonagh's play, revived by director Michael Grandage as a blend of bloodbath and cartoon caper, pokes fun at the more demented forms of political extremism, and as the body parts pile up Turner switches nimbly between dead-eyed coolness and twinkly volatility.""

But it was left to The Times's Ann Treneman, who gave the play four stars, to suggest that perhaps Turner wasn't the star after all - it was his cat.

""The star is not, as you may believe, Aidan Turner, who features in a certain TV series called Poldark... instead, all our eyes are on his adored feline, Wee Thomas.""

The Lieutenant of Inishmore is running at London's Noel Coward Theatre until 8 September.

The Bank of England governor now has more confidence in the UK economy, in a speech which could stoke expectations of an interest rate rise in August.

Mark Carney said recent data had given him ""greater confidence"" that weak first-quarter growth ""was largely due to the weather"".

He said household spending and sentiment had ""bounced back strongly"".

England winning the World Cup would be an ""unalloyed, unadulterated absolute good"" for the economy, Mr Carney added.

In a speech at the Northern Powerhouse Summit in Newcastle, Mr Carney said: ""Overall, recent domestic data suggest the economy is evolving largely in line with the May Inflation Report projections, which see demand growing at rates slightly above those of supply and domestic cost pressures building.""

The pound edged up 0.2% against the dollar to $1.3254 following his remarks.

Last month, three members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee - including chief economist Andy Haldane - voted in favour of lifting the interest rate to 0.75%.

Mr Carney was among the six MPC members who voted to keep rates on hold at 0.5%.

He also warned that a global trade war could dampen economic growth.

Mr said ""protectionist rhetoric"" was rising and was now turning into action: ""There are some, tentative signs that this more hostile and uncertain trading environment may be dampening activity.""

Mr Carney cited evidence from the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI), which suggested that global export orders and manufacturing output have fallen back from highs at the start of the year.

On Friday, the US will implement a 25% import tariff on a list of hundreds of Chinese goods. On the same day, China will also impose 25% tariffs on a range of US goods, including pork products, fish and rice.

Cabin crew at Ryanair based in Italy, Portugal, Spain and Belgium say they will strike in late July.

Cabin crew in Italy will go on strike for 24-hours on 25 July, while crew in Spain, Portugal and Belgium will strike for 48 hours on 25-26 July.

Unions said further action may follow if the Irish airline does not make concessions on some employment terms.

On Wednesday the unions issued a list of changes they wanted to their terms and conditions.

They include a request to be paid into bank accounts in their own countries, rather than in the Republic of Ireland.

Earlier this week, pilots directly employed by Ryanair and who are members of its Irish trade union said they would will go on strike for the first time on 12 July.

Last year, Ryanair pilots went on strike to protest about their working conditions.

After a long-standing hostile attitude to unions and a refusal to allow such organisations to represent staff, Ryanair finally agreed to union recognition in December.

The pilots are striking as they say conditions that prompted last year's industrial action have not improved sufficiently.

The four unions representing cabin crew said in a joint statement: ""We call on the European Commission, and the governments of every European country where Ryanair operates, to act upon the social dumping performed by the Irish low cost carrier and to enforce the EU employment and national imperative legislation.""

The statement was signed by Belgium's CNE/LBC, Spain's SITCPLA and USO, Portugal's SNPVAC and Italy's Ultrasporti unions.

They do not represent all Ryanair cabin crew in those countries, but have said other staff are welcome to join the action.

Ryanair has said employment conditions for its staff are competitive, if not better, than those offered by rivals.

816,816,,www.bbc.com,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption MEPs have been subject to fierce lobbying by both those who favoured and those who opposed the legislation

MEPs have voted to reject a controversial copyright law in its current form, deciding to return to the issue in September.

The law would have put a greater responsibility on individual websites to check for copyright infringements.

But the web's inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee and others had expressed concerns about the proposed rules, which they said threatened internet freedom.

Opponents greeted the decision as a victory.

Julia Reda, a Pirate Party MEP who had campaigned against the legislation tweeted: ""Great success: Your protests have worked! The European Parliament has sent the copyright law back to the drawing board.""

BPI Music, which represents UK record labels, had supported the bill and tweeted: ""We respect the decision... we will work with MEPs over the next weeks to explain how the proposed directive will benefit not just European creativity, but also internet users and the technology sector.""

Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales told the BBC he hoped that the music industry could find a way to compromise before the September debate.

""Don't think about filtering everything everyone uploads to the internet. That's a pipe dream but you are never going to get that,"" he said.

Instead, he added, they should look to renegotiating deals with platforms such as YouTube to get ""fairer remuneration"".

Analysis:

Image copyright EPA/PA/BBC

By Mark Savage, Music reporter

The combined clout of Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox, Placido Domingo and David Guetta wasn't enough to persuade MEPs to make sweeping changes to copyright law.

They were among 1,300 musicians who urged politicians to enact a law forcing sites like YouTube and Facebook to use filters that would stop users illegally uploading their music.

Musicians were being cheated out of money, they argued, even though websites were making huge profits off their work.

Critics said the laws would stifle creativity - with Creative Commons chief Ryan Merkley observing that The Beatles would have been prevented from performing cover versions under the proposed rules.

For you and me, it could have resulted in text, music and videos posted to blogs, social networks and comment sections being yanked from the net at point of upload - somewhat like YouTube's controversial Content ID system on steroids.

In the end, MEPs decided the changes needed more debate; and sent the proposals back to Parliament. The two sides will undoubtedly step up their campaigns in the meantime.

What were they voting for?

The Copyright Directive is intended to bring rules around content in line with the digital age.

The two most controversial parts of it are Article 11 and Article 13.

The first of these is intended to provide fair remuneration for publishers and prevent online content-sharing platforms and news aggregators sharing links without paying for them. But it has been called the ""link tax"" by opponents and raised questions about who will have to pay and how much.

Article 13 puts more onus on websites to enforce copyright laws and could mean that any online platform that allows users to post text, images, sounds or code will need a way to assess and filter content.

Who supported it?

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sir Paul McCartney is among artists in favour of the legislation

Supporters of the rule changes say they would improve copyright rules, giving intellectual-property protection to news and video content.

On Wednesday, Sir Paul McCartney wrote to MEPs urging them to vote in favour of the changes.

""Today, some user-upload content platforms refuse to compensate artists and all music creators fairly for their work while they exploit it for their own profit,"" reads the letter.

""The proposed Copyright Directive and its Article 13 would address the value gap and help assure a sustainable future for the music ecosystem and its creators, fans and digital music services alike.""

Centre-right German MEP Axel Voss was in charge of pushing through the legislation and recently published a video intended to counter what he called ""fake news"" about the legislation.

Who opposed it?

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jimmy Wales has called the legislation ""disastrous""

Critics claim that Article 13 could have a massive impact on how people use the internet, putting paid to memes and remixes.

In particular there are concerns that it will require websites to scan all content being uploaded, automatically blocking anything that might infringe copyright.

The use of artificial intelligence in filters could mean they will not be able to distinguish between content that infringes copyright and fair use, such as satire and memes, they say.

A petition against the change - known as Save Your Internet - had gained 750,000 signatures.

And a letter signed by 70 influential technology leaders, including Vint Cerf and Tim Berners-Lee, described it as an ""imminent threat to the future"" of the internet.

Italy Wikipedia shut down for a day earlier this week in protest at the plans, which co-founder Jimmy Wales has described as ""disastrous"".

The editors wrote that ""Wikipedia itself would be at risk of closing"".

At the time, they said: ""If the proposal is approved, it may be impossible to share a newspaper article on social networks or find it on a search engine.""",MEPs reject controversial copyright law,http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44712475

818,818,2018-06-24 00:00:00,www.bbc.com,"I’m a quarter Welsh. My darling grandmother grew up in the Rhondda Valley, a small mining town where her father was the school principal. She didn’t speak a lot of Welsh, other than to delight us by reciting the longest train station name in the world (Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch). I was always aware, though, of the word ‘cwtch’. She didn’t use it often, but I knew it was special; it was almost said in a whisper. I remember her using it once in hospital, when we first thought she was dying. It’s a special sort of cuddle, she said. And that it is: a ‘cwtch’ (pronounced ‘kutch’, to rhyme with ‘butch’) is the Welsh word for a cuddle or hug, but it’s also so much more than that.

Its second meaning is a cubbyhole or cupboard; a small space in which to store things safely. Blend those two meanings and you get a better idea of what the word means: it’s the wrapping of your arms around someone to make them feel safe in the world. It’s precisely what my grandmother needed, and gave, as she started to see her life slip away from her. I remember nuzzling into her neck, smelling the Youth Dew perfume she wore on her papery skin, and feeling like there was no safer space in the world. That is exactly how a cwtch ought to make you feel: safe, warm, comforted.

• The Greek word that can’t be translated

It’s an emotionally significant embrace and an intrinsically Welsh word that evokes a sense of home. My grandmother was some 17,000km from her Welsh home when she died in her sunburnt adopted home of Sydney, Australia. It is of little surprise to me that she would use that word then, wanting, probably, to transport herself back to where she grew up. It’s in times of fear, danger, distress and melancholy that we most need a cwtch. It’s not a casual gesture of affection; it’s a profound one, and it was invented by the Welsh.

Hugs are for everyone; cwtches are only for a few

“It’s not just a cuddle or a hug – it’s something special and something I wouldn’t do with everyone,” said Amy Jones, a Welsh Londoner whose mother comes from Cardiff and father from the Valleys. “A cwtch is what my parents would give me when I was young and had fallen over, it’s something my husband and I do on the sofa when we’re in a blissful cocoon, it’s what I give my friends when they’re stressed or sad. A cwtch is something you do when you’re overflowing with joy and love at another person’s sheer existence in your life that you can’t help but try and squeeze that love into them; it’s a safe space of love and comfort for someone who needs it; it’s all the best parts of being alive and loving someone, in a pair of arms. Hugs are for everyone; cwtches are only for a few, very special people in my life.”

Despite not being Welsh themselves, Jones’ husband and friends know the word and they’re well aware how much it means to Jones – both as code for ‘I need emotional support’ and as a motif of her Welsh identity. Like my grandma, Jones uses the word to take herself back to her roots. “I haven’t lived with my family in six years, but the word cwtch takes me right home. But more than that – when someone asks if I want a cwtch, they’re doing so because they know how much it means to me, and it makes me feel incredibly seen and understood.”

Dr Mercedes Durham, senior lecturer in sociolinguistics at Cardiff University, says that we use words like cwtch to distinguish ourselves as having a particular national identity. “Language has a lot to do with our identity and our culture. The word ‘cwtch’ is used by Welsh speakers and English-speaking Welsh people to indicate that they’re Welsh. It’s an emblem of being Welsh. In linguistics, we talk about the commodification words, and using them to sell an identity. People use this word to prove that they are Welsh. In gift shops, there are mugs and T-shirts that say ‘everyone can hug, only the Welsh can cwtch’. There are strong positive connotations for Welsh people.”

Interestingly, the word ‘cwtch’ is used both by Welsh-speaking people and English-speaking Welsh people. It’s even gaining a little traction in the English language, at least with people who have Welsh friends or family. Jonathan Dent, senior assistant editor of new words at the Oxford English Dictionary, has noticed an uptake in its usage.

‘Hug’ and ‘cuddle’ might be serviceable English equivalents, but neither of them will ever convey everything that ‘cwtch’ does

“It was named as Wales’ best-loved word in 2007, has been used in wedding vows and is now flourishing in new contexts. A Twitter search shows the word in significant daily use on the platform, with people looking forward to a cwtch from their cariad [sweetheart], longing for a cwtch from anyone or offering one another virtual *cwtches*.”

He says there are other Welsh words we might use out of their traditional linguistic context, but we may not always get across the full nuance of their meaning. “The meanings of the Welsh words hiraeth (‘a sense of homesickness or nostalgia; longing; wistfulness’) and hwyl (‘a stirring feeling of emotional motivation and energy; a feeling which inspires passionate eloquence’) are often said to be impossible to capture in English, although we still have to try. In the case of cwtch, ‘hug’ and ‘cuddle’ might be serviceable English equivalents, but neither of them will ever convey everything that ‘cwtch’ does to someone who has grown up with the word.”

There is an enchanting profoundness to the word ‘cwtch’ that is not entirely translatable in English. And yet, it’s so lovely to add foreign words to our vocabulary, especially when we can’t quite land on the right English word. “One explanation for why we start using these words outside our own language is that there is a semantic gap in our own language or an experience we can’t quite articulate and then we discover a word for it in another language and we latch onto it,” said Dr Tim Lomas, professor in positive psychology at the University of East London and author of The Happiness Dictionary. “It’s a bit like the word ‘hygge’. Hygge is everywhere these days, and we use it to try and capture some of that enviable Nordic lifestyle. These words are more than words; they’re about a way of life and a state of mind. I don’t see why cwtch couldn’t have a similar movement to hygge. It would allow us to make a way of living around it, around cosiness and safety.”

We need cwtches more than ever

Could ‘cwtch’ be the new ‘hygge’? Could we use it to evoke and sell a sense of comfort and warmth? Could its popularity be an endorsement of intimacy and kindness? Eifion Griffiths, a third-generation Welsh textiles maker and owner of wool company Melin Tregwynt, thinks we very well could. “Like our interest in the concept of hygge, using the word cwtch is a contrast to a world of darkness and danger,” he said. “If you’re upset, you need a cwtch. If you’re wandering around happy, a cwtch doesn’t come into it. We need cwtches more than ever, I think, because it’s not a very comfortable world at the moment. You have to understand, when you give someone a cwtch you’re not coming on to someone. It’s a non-threatening hug, it’s not a danger or a threat. It’s a safe space, something that takes you back to your childhood, something that makes you feel warm – not just physically but emotionally.”

Some days, there’s nothing I’d like more in this world than a cwtch from my sweet, doting grandmother. She was an exemplary giver of cwtches: warm, generous, affectionate without reserve. She was, despite leaving the Rhondda Valley as a teenager, idiosyncratically Welsh, and to show that, she’d use words like ‘cwtch’. It is a deeply significant word to anyone who was born in Wales, and truly anyone who loves someone Welsh. She’d be proud to think that more people had started using it, that more people were actively making one another feel safe and warm.

819,819,2018-06-28 00:00:00,www.bbc.com,"I had set out to explore the heart of Shikoku, the smallest and least visited of Japan’s four main islands, and was white-knuckledly navigating my rental car along a one-lane road through a mountain valley toward a storied vine bridge. I drove through a seemingly deserted village of a dozen homes perched precariously on metal stilts over a river, turned a corner and saw in the distance three figures slumped against an electricity pole.

They were dressed in rubber boots, rough-spun farmers’ trousers and windbreakers, and wore white gloves on their hands. Baseball caps covered their heads. Yet something was odd in their postures. They didn’t seem quite human. As I got closer, I realised they weren’t human. Their faces were made of white cloth, plump and pillowy, with buttons for eyes and black yarn for eyebrows.

Five metres further on, I saw another of these human-sized figures pushing a wheelbarrow in a field, then another pulling weeds, then five of them sitting on a bench at a bus stop.

I was wondering what alternate reality I had wandered into when I spied another figure on the side of the road ahead. This one was also remarkably lifelike, dressed in black sneakers, trousers and a grey smock, her hands gloved and her head hidden under a bonnet. I turned my eyes back to the road, then abruptly stopped. That figure had taken a step! And another!

I pulled up and walked warily towards the bonneted figure, not quite sure who or what I was about to encounter.

“Excuse me!” I called. The figure seemed not to hear. “Excuse me!” I yelled, much louder.

The figure stopped and slowly turned.

A human face appeared – warm, flesh-coloured, lined and benign, with tiny, sparkling eyes. “Yes?” a woman’s voice replied in Japanese.

“Excuse me, but may I ask you a question?”

“Yes, of course.”

I walked forward, sweeping my arm towards the figures on both sides of the road. “Do you know who has created these wonderful creatures?”

She looked at me intently for a moment, then broke into a smile. “I did!”

That was how I met Ayano Tsukimi, the scarecrow master of Shikoku. The year was 2013, and I was venturing into the virtually impenetrable green folds of the Iya Valley, a remote region in the north-eastern part of the island where paved roads had been introduced only half a century before.

My wife was born and raised on Shikoku, and I had heard about the Iya Valley from my brother-in-law, who had said that it was a rugged place of thatch-roofed farmhouses, barley fields, vine bridges and traditional ways – but he had not mentioned anything about human-like figures.

Ayano-san burst into laughter at the wonder in my eyes.

“May I ask you about these?” I said.

“Of course!” she said. “Would you like some tea?”

They’re rather unusual, aren’t they?

We wandered past two small boys – well, boy-like figures – playing on a rusting bicycle, and a woman sitting in a work shed with her back to the road. Ayano-san led me up a driveway to her simple house. Seated beside the path to her door were half a dozen more figures: a girl in school uniform; a mother with a baby in her lap; an elderly gentleman in a business suit holding a cigarette.

I took off my shoes and stepped into a tatami-matted room crammed with more of her creations, including a couple dressed in traditional wedding kimonos, standing formally at the end of the room. I felt like a character in an episode of The Twilight Zone.

Ayano-san bade me sit on the tatami mats beside her traditional irori hearth, then left to make tea. She returned with a small lacquer tray bearing two cups, and placed one carefully before me.

I bowed and said thank you, and she looked at me, eyes twinkling. “They’re rather unusual, aren’t they?”

“Yes, they truly are. Please tell me about them.”

“Well,” she began. “I grew up here but left to go to Osaka with my parents when I was in secondary school. I stayed there, got married and had children. At one point my parents moved back here and then, when my mother passed away, I came back to care of my father. That was in 2002.

“I made the first kakashi…”

I stopped her. “I’m sorry, but what was that word?”

“Kakashi. The figures farmers use to scare away birds from their crops.”

“Ah, kakashi!” Scarecrows.

“I made the first kakashi to scare away the birds. I noticed that they were eating the seeds in that field out there” – she pointed outside her doorway – “and so I wanted to shoo them away.”

“I made a few more for that purpose. Then when our neighbour up the road passed away, I missed her – I used to talk with her every day. So I made a scarecrow that looked like her, so that I could continue to greet her every morning.

“Over time,” she said, with a shrug and a sigh, “more and more of the villagers passed away. I began to make scarecrows to remember them and in a way to keep them alive.”

She paused. I sipped my tea and watched. For a moment, a cloud passed over her face, shadowing the sun of her smile. Then it evaporated, and she pointed to a figure seated on the tatami behind me, a wise-looking woman with braided grey hair made of thick yarn, clad in an elegant grey kimono. “That’s my mother,” she said. “I still talk to her every day. Would you like to take a walk?”

We wandered a few minutes down the road to an imposing two-storey concrete building behind a dirt playground. “This used to be the elementary school,” she said. “But over the years, the students became fewer and fewer until finally, last year, they closed the school. Now all the students in this area go to a school 30 minutes away by bus.”

There was no regret in her voice; she was simply stating the facts. “Come inside!” she said, opening the door into the school.

As we walked, I could hardly believe my eyes. Scarecrows were everywhere. A scarecrow principal supervised the hallway, scarecrow teachers gathered in a teachers’ lounge, and in a schoolroom, 20 scarecrow children were seated obediently at their desks, textbooks open, earnestly looking at the scarecrow teacher at the front of the room. On the blackboard behind her was written, ‘My future dream’ – the Japanese equivalent of ‘What I want to be when I grow up’.

There was a warmth to Ayano-san’s character and a poignancy to her story that took seed in my soul

By the time we finished our tour, the sun was lowering. I needed to get back to my hotel before dark, so I said a hasty thank you and promised that I would return.

Driving back along the winding road, I was filled with deeply mixed feelings. On the one hand, there was something undeniably unsettling about the figures, especially the schoolchildren, who seemed like characters in a horror film about to leap into life. But on the other hand, there was a warmth to Ayano-san’s character and a poignancy to her story that took seed in my soul.

A year later, on a sunny spring day, I returned. This time I was leading a group of eight Americans to the vine bridge, and when we reached Nagoro, the scarecrow village, I asked our minivan driver to pull off the road. Ayano-san was standing in front of her house.

I leapt out. “Hello, Ayano-san!” I called out, waving.

She peered at me, puzzled. Then she looked more closely. “Ah, welcome back!” she said. And she invited us into her home to introduce her creations.

For a year, I had been wondering how she made these figures. Finally, I had the chance to ask.

It takes about three days to make one kakashi, Ayano-san explained. She begins with the face, taking a square patch of white, stretchy, jersey-type cloth and wrapping it around the kind of batting used to stuff quilts. After sewing the back, she stuffs in more batting to form the nose, sews on buttons for the eyes and shapes the lips by deftly pinching and sewing the cloth. She takes special care with the ears, Ayano-san said, tucking and sewing the cloth so that the ears have individualised creases. “I want to make sure my kakashi can hear well,” she explained with a smile.

For the arms and legs, she wraps wire around rolled-up newspapers, using more newspaper to stuff the torso. When the body is complete, she dresses it in clothing – from scarves to elaborate kimonos – that has been brought or sent to her by fans from throughout Japan. She then places the figure in the location she has envisioned, utilising the wire’s flexibility to arrange the arms and legs.

When she finished her explanation, we all burst into applause. Her smile filled the room.

I have returned to Nagoro every spring since then, and in the intervening years, as other foreigners have made their way here too, Ayano-san has become something of a celebrity. A German film-maker posted a short documentary about her in 2014, and a dozen articles have been written about her (many of which, sadly in this age of copycat journalism, mistakenly state that her father has passed away – news that was quite a shock to her father, who was pottering energetically away in the yard on my most recent visit this May).

Accounts by other writers often use ‘creepy’ or similar words to describe her creations, but as I have been drawn back every year, my understanding has ripened.

She fills the kakashi with art and soul and loving memory

Nagoro’s story is not unique. Every year it’s played out in hundreds of villages around Japan. Children growing up in these remote areas, dealing with the demanding conditions of rural life, are seduced by the allure of big cities – conveniences, jobs, entertainment – and leave their hometowns, never to return.

The dilemma is common, but Ayano-san’s response has been pure, wholehearted and unique. A few times a week she gathers cloth, batting, newspaper, wire and clothing, and begins to craft a figure who represents a cherished grandmother or grandfather who has passed away, or a child who moved to the city, or even a visitor who has left a mark on her heart.

She has chosen to repopulate her village with these eminently un-scary scarecrows, and she fills them with art and soul and loving memory.

In this, she symbolises Shikoku itself, a stunningly beautiful but largely ignored and impoverished island whose residents meet the challenges of daily life with a deeply ingrained resourcefulness and resilience. Every day on Shikoku, farmers plant and harvest rice, mikan oranges, shiitake mushrooms, wheat, tomatoes and other crops, as they have for centuries; every day, fishermen motor out before dawn and return each afternoon with nets silver-shimmering with yellowtail, sea bream and bonito.

And in the island’s best-known tradition, Buddhist pilgrims from near and far walk a sacred circuit of 88 temples, honouring the founder of Japanese Shingon Buddhism, Kobo Daishi. As they walk, they are welcomed by the locals with smiles, bows and gifts of rice, oranges and biscuits to help them on their journey.

In her own way, I have come to realise, Ayano-san too is offering gifts to help us all on our life’s journey.

On my May visit to Nagoro, I met another resident of the village and asked her what she thought about the scarecrows.

“At first they were a little disturbing,” she said, “for us just as for visitors. But I’ve come to like them and find comfort in them. I recognise people who have passed away and it’s nice to have them still here.”

On that visit, Ayano-san again invited me and my fellow travellers into her home. I asked her how many scarecrows she had made since 2002. “I think about 450,” she said. “Every three years or so, I have to replace them. Now there are 27 people living in the village – and 200 scarecrows!” She laughed.

One of the members of our group asked if, once her father passed away, she would move back to Osaka.

There was a long silence and she seemed lost in thought, gazing into the distance.

I recognise people who have passed away and it’s nice to have them still here

Finally she spoke. “I don’t think so,” she said. She looked out at the fields, the bus stop, the woodshed, the one-lane road, all of them enlivened by her creations. “I’m quite content here. I’m among my friends.

“And look!” She turned back to us, her eyes sparkling, her face crinkling into a bright smile. “They are bringing new friends to my village, too!”

820,820,2018-07-04 00:00:00,www.bbc.com,"After a long, uphill cycle to the Danish battlefield of Dybbøl, I stopped to gaze at the brilliant-white windmill with its black-capped roof and great red sails, sitting high in the clouds above the fishing town of Sønderborg. I was cycling from the German border to Copenhagen across Denmark's islands – but had been side-tracked by the curious story of southern Jutland's rebel cakes.

Dybbøl Windmill had ground wheat into flour across the centuries from 1774, despite being pummelled in two Schleswig wars and destroyed more than once by fire. After the Prussian-Austrian occupation of southern Jutland in 1864, the mill was, if anything, busier than ever. When the occupiers refused to give the Danes an alcohol license for their community halls, the defiant Jutlanders thought that if they couldn’t have their beloved coffee punch with schnapps, they’d have cake instead – made with flour from the mill, of course.

The community hall was an important part of Danish culture; a place to meet and share ideas. During the occupation, the need for the Jutland Danes to preserve their national identity became even more important. The hall became a Danish micro-society, a safe haven, where the southern Jutlanders could sing patriotic Danish songs and celebrate their Danish-ness. The kaffebord, or coffee table, was not so much about coffee (now that the Danes couldn't make coffee punch) but about the Danish cakes that stretched along the long table.

With every year that passed under the occupation, the spreads became more elaborate, as Jutland's cake-making housewives jostled to be queen of the kaffebord. Cream cakes, pastries, fruit tarts and biscuits of every sort crammed the table. It was full-on competition, but more importantly, it was an act of defiance and resistance against the oppressor. After a referendum in 1920, southern Jutland was handed back to the Danes, and although the liquor license was granted again, the coffee table, too good to abandon, continued to thrive. To this day, it's a favourite way to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries and other special events in the region.

It was an act of defiance and resistance against the oppressor

Dybbøl Windmill didn't just produce flour for the coffee-table cakes, however; the patriotic miller allowed Danish soldiers to use it as an observation post during the second Schleswig war of 1864. Signals were transmitted to the men on the watch, but despite the army's best efforts, they were unable to hold their line of defence at Dybbøl against the better equipped Prussian-Austrian army. The Danish were overwhelmed and south Jutland was captured.

The visitor centre attached to the windmill tells this story, while across the road, on the site of the Dybbøl Battlefield, a memorial pays homage to the fallen Danish soldiers. Below it, the land drops away to the Strait of Alssund and the fishing town of Sønderborg just out of sight, where I was heading in search of the Jutland coffee table and its mountain of cake.

I swung my leg over my bicycle and free-wheeled through fields of bright rapeseed down to the strait. Across the water, the red roofs and colourful facades of the harbour houses stretched out along the quayside to a heavily fortified castle. Now a museum, Sønderborg Castle tells the story of Prussian-Austrian occupation of southern Jutland after the 1864 Schleswig War, and again of German occupation in World War II. I wanted to find out more.

Ignoring the attractive waterfront with its terraced cafes and castle for the moment, I crossed the drawbridge and pushed on up the hill to a pedestrianised shopping street in the heart of the town. The restaurant, Det Sønderjyske Køkken (The South Jutland Cuisine), was hosting a coffee-table event – and I was about to eat my own weight in cake and biscuits, or so it seemed. Inside, the room was filled with locals and a handful of Dutch and Germans, along with my holidaying British companions. At the head of the room, a long table was stacked high with meringues, puddings, cakes, pastries and biscuits. Working along the table from left to right, I piled my plate high, glad that most of the portions were small or bite-sized.

“The number of cakes on the table has varied through the years,” Jesper, the restaurant owner explained to me. “But somehow we seem to have settled on seven. Nowadays, tradition decrees there should be seven soft cakes and seven hard cakes – and sometimes, when there's a really extravagant kaffebord, there will be seven layered cream cakes as well.”

“So, where do I start?” I asked.

“We start with pomle – the bread roll with butter,” he answered.

I ate the cardamom-flavoured roll with jam before going on to try the Sønderjysk festkringle, a buttery Danish pastry made with candied citrus peel and raisins.

“Now we eat the two ‘stop cakes’,” said Jesper. “‘Stop’ meaning have a rest with the lighter cakes before returning to the richer soft cakes. Honningkage is honeyed gingerbread topped with apricot compote – and krydderkage is a plain spicy cake.”

“It must have been very expensive to lay on so many elaborate cakes during the Prussian occupation, was it not?” I asked.

“That's true. The most elaborate coffee tables were held in rural areas where country folks had the ingredients on their farms,” he said.

Returning to the richer soft cakes, I tried the rabarber trifli, a delicious rhubarb trifle, then the blommetærte, a plum tart, before finishing with the brø'tort, a nutty rye cake with a blackcurrant topping. There was no question; I was on a sugar rush.

But just as partakers think they have reached a saturation point with these rich and filling ‘soft cakes’, the thoughtful Jutland cake-makers calm the palate – and the stomach – with seven plainer and lighter ‘hard cakes’, or biscuits.

First up was the knepkager, its delightful name describing the crunch the biscuit makes when you bite into it, then the fedtkager, a biscuit made with lard. Next, I tried the almond nøddetvebakker, baked twice (once to harden the biscuit, and again to give it its warm brown colour). After that came the herrnhutkager, a syrupy, spicy bake with orange and lemon zest, cloves and pepper.

My cake marathon had almost come to an end: I feasted on vaniljekrans (a vanilla ring cake) and the wonderfully named goderåd, which translates as ‘good advice’. Last of all, I bit into the ingenting, a meringue drizzled with rum. The meringue name demonstrates the Danes mischievous sense of fun: when guests had munched their way through six hard cakes, they would be asked what they could still eat. ‘Nothing,’ they would usually reply, and would promptly be offered ingenting, which means ‘nothing’.

A huge variety of cakes and biscuits can be found at coffee tables across southern Jutland, some with strange and amusing names: søsterkage (sister cake), and kys og klap (kisses and applause), for example. But the most intriguing of all are the fried biscuits called klejner, or ‘twisted boys and girls’. The boys are cut into rectangular shapes, with one end of the pastry pulled through the hole in the middle to make clear the boy's gender, while the girls are cut with a round glass and twisted into a feminine shape, with a hole made with a thimble.

I staggered out of Det Sønderjyske Køkken, my stomach filled with spice and sugar and fruit and nuts. I thought about the Danish gathered in their community halls, defiantly holding meetings, singing patriotic Danish songs and eating cake in spite of their Prussian oppressors, only to experience German occupation all over again in World War II. “What must that have been like?” I wondered.

I spent the night in a country cottage overlooking the Baltic Sea just a few miles through the woods on the other side of the harbour. Outside, the wind rustled in the great copper beech, a red tree once planted next to many dwellings across southern Jutland to mark the home of Danish patriots, who also painted their doors red to demonstrate their alliance to the Danish flag.

In the morning, I had a visit from the 78-year-old former mayor of Sønderborg, Mr Hansen. Nobody seems to know his Christian name, and he is simply referred to as AP. He had come by to tell me about life under the second German occupation. Born at the beginning of World War II, his early childhood was marred by war and the new German occupation. We sat down under the window, surrounded by sofa throws and candles, the blue of the Baltic Sea sparkling in the sunlight beyond the barley field. It was hard to imagine those turbulent times in this peaceful place.

“How did the Jutland Danes feel about being occupied all over again in the Second World War?” I asked.

“You know, it was very peaceful to begin with,” he said. “The Germans didn't try to suppress our Danish culture. We were allowed to get on with our lives as usual, so there was little resistance initially. The resistance came later in 1943 when Hitler called for the deportation of Danish Jews. When the Danish Resistance organised a strike, the German occupiers became more heavy-handed. Nonetheless, even in the early days, it was still a shock to be occupied all over again. The Germans arrived in the springtime. The air was different and there was the constant drone of planes. Whenever I hear the sound of planes in spring, it’s still emotional for me.”

It was a shock to be occupied all over again

Mr Hansen ran his fingers over a stock of white hair, lost in memories of the war. “My parents were good people,” he said. “They took in a Jewish boy, Hans Franz, and eventually helped him to get to Sweden. Later, my mother sheltered a Danish woman who'd had a child to a German soldier. My parents weren’t the only decent Danes: many other ordinary Danes helped to evacuate more than 7,000 Jews to Sweden.”

“And how do people feel about the Germans now after two occupations?” I asked.

“There is still a German minority group living here, and they are encouraged to preserve their own culture,” he replied. “They have their own schools, libraries and sports clubs. We have a good relationship with our German neighbours too. There are many German tourists who come back faithfully year after year to spend their holidays here. They love Denmark and its culture.”

I thought of the German visitors who had mingled with the Danes at the kaffebord at Det Sønderjyske Køkken the day before. The coffee table, once associated with war and rebellion, had become an opportunity for shared friendship and cake.

It's always been a very personal experience

When chatting to Gerda Bouma from the local tourism office, she mused: “You know, the coffee table has been southern Jutland's best-kept secret. It's always been a very personal experience for the local people who have held it in their own homes on special occasions with close family and friends over the decades. But it's time to share the coffee table experience with others, don't you think?""

I couldn't have agreed more as I cycled away from Sønderborg with a belly full of cake.

822,822,,www.bbc.co.uk,"When Rembrandt van Rijn died, aged 63, lonely, bankrupt and neglected, there was little sign that he’d become such a central figure in the history of European art. His early fame had faded. His work no longer commanded high prices. Unable to pay his bills, he’d been evicted from his home and studio.

The nation where this revival started wasn’t his native Netherlands but Great Britain.

Yet today he’s universally revered. What happened? Well, since his death, in 1669, his reputation has grown and grown, and the nation where this revival started wasn’t his native Netherlands but Great Britain.

Rembrandt – Britain’s Discovery of The Master at the Scottish National Gallery tells the story of this renaissance. It begins with one of his acute self-portraits – his first work to leave the Netherlands when it was given to Charles I in 1633. It ends with gutsy works by Frank Auerbach and Leon Kossoff, two of the many British artists he’s inspired.

What drove this reappraisal? As usual, a big factor was money. Rembrandt’s career coincided with Holland’s Golden Age, an era of commercial prowess. Yet in the 18th Century Dutch fortunes dwindled while the British economy took off. Now Dutch paintings were cheap and British toffs had cash to burn. Built by Robert Adam, their new mansions had lots of wall space.

Alison Brie (Mad Men) stars as Ruth Wilder, a struggling actress who can’t find any meaty roles for women in Hollywood, and after refusing many other options opts to become the main ‘heel’ (i.e. villain) of the gimmicky wrestling show directed by Marc Maron’s sleazy and washed-up film-maker.
