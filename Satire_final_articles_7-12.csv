Speaking to reporters, Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau said that there had been “total consensus” among non-U.S. participants to withhold information about the time, place, and existence of an after party from Trump.

“The plan was, if Trump asked about an after party, we were going to be, like, ‘Ask Angela Merkel,’ ” Macron said. “Angela was going to totally stonewall him.”

Merkel confirmed that she had planned to tell Trump that she “didn’t think anyone was planning to do anything” after the summit and steadfastly to deny “hearing anything” about an after party.

“I would have had no problem lying to him, despite our two countries going way back, to D-Day or whenever,” Merkel said, rolling her eyes.

Trudeau said that the after party will proceed as scheduled when the G-7 concludes, on Saturday, adding, “Now that Trump is out of here, we’ll really have something to celebrate.”","Macron, Trudeau Say They Weren’t Going to Tell Trump Where G-7 After Party Was",http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/macron-trudeau-say-they-werent-going-to-tell-trump-where-g-7-afterparty-was,www.newyorker.com

The special counsel said that he was “absolutely tickled” that the Eagles had accepted his invitation. “I’m a huge fan of the Philadelphia Eagles, and it turns out the feeling is mutual,” he said.

According to one member of the team, the Eagles accepted Mueller’s invitation only after being assured that their visit would not in any way distract the special counsel from “getting his job done.”

“What Bob Mueller is doing is so much more important than any Super Bowl,” the Eagle player said. “If he wins, the whole world wins.”

The offer reportedly came after Kim spoke glowingly to Trump about the Vice-President’s obsequiousness, sources said.

“Even by North Korean standards, Pence puts my toadies to shame,” Kim reportedly said.

Once the necessary paperwork is squared away, Pence could begin bowing and scraping in Pyongyang as early as next week.

Going forward, Pence’s duties as senior sycophant to Trump are expected to be performed by Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California.

Although State Department insiders were taken by surprise by Trump’s offering of Pence, for whom the U.S. will receive nothing in return, the deal has been met with nearly universal approval.

In interviews with people from around the world, respondents said that the travel ban struck them as unnecessary, because the United States was not currently on the list of the top hundred countries to which they would consider travelling.

When asked to name the reasons they felt that a travel ban was superfluous, many of those interviewed cited the United States’s gun violence and crumbling infrastructure, as well as its broken educational and health-care systems, while others singled out its President’s startling disrespect for democratic norms and human rights.

Given those views, most of the foreigners interviewed said they found the news of the Supreme Court’s decision baffling. “When I heard that the United States was having a travel ban, I assumed that was to keep people from leaving,” one respondent said, echoing the sentiments of many.",Foreigners Unsure Why Anyone Would Want to Travel to U.S. at This Point,http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/foreigners-unsure-why-anyone-would-want-to-travel-to-us-at-this-point,www.newyorker.com

“We’ve been living under assumption that a TV personality could tweet out as many racist things as he or she wanted with no consequences,” the source said. “Now, all of a sudden, our worst nightmare has come true.”

White House staffers are reportedly combing through Trump’s thirty-seven thousand tweets, searching for ones that could be deemed fireable offenses, and have so far flagged more than thirty-six thousand of them.

Many on Trump’s team are urging calm, however, claiming that the dismissal of one racist TV star could be an “isolated example.”

Trump defended his use of the word “animals” to describe some undocumented immigrants, earning a huge ovation from the Ambien-dosed crowd.

He also said that Mexico would pay for a wall on its border with the U.S., a claim that he has repeatedly made while under the influence of Ambien.

In addition to offering to host U.S.-Canada talks in Pyongyang, Kim urged the immediate creation of a demilitarized zone along the border separating the two hostile nations.

“In exchange for Canadian Mounties agreeing to stand down on their side of the border, the United States, in turn, would dismantle its nuclear weapons,” Kim said.

Although stating that “North Korea stands ready and willing to be an honest broker” in peace talks between the two countries, he urged Trump to dial back the “inflammatory rhetoric” that he aimed at Canadians over the weekend.

Carol Foyler, a middle-school history teacher from Bethesda, Maryland, spoke of a “scary moment” during a White House tour last week when her class had a “near-miss” with Trump.

“We were walking by the Oval Office, the door was open, and I could see he was in there,” the educator said. “I just said to my kids, ‘Keep your heads down and walk fast.’ ”

Foyler said that she considers herself lucky to have protected her students from the devastating impact of Trump’s ignorance, and acknowledges that the situation could have been “much worse.”

After signing pardon after pardon while Pence looked on intently, Trump commanded the Vice-President to sign a “practice pardon” to prove that he “wouldn’t mess anything up,” the source said.

Before trying his hand at issuing a pardon, Pence heaped praise on Trump for the pardoning demonstration he had just given.

“Mr. President, as in everything you do, your mastery of pardoning has been a wonder to behold,” he said. “I pray to God that, if I am ever called upon to issue a pardon, I do it with one-tenth of the skill and grace you have just displayed.”

In a lengthy memo sent to the special counsel, Robert Mueller, the lawyers pushed back vehemently against any allegation that Trump was legally elected President.

“Because Russian interference made the election of Donald J. Trump wholly illegitimate, any attempt to remove him from an office that he does not legally hold is clearly impossible,” the memo asserted.

The memo claimed that the Constitution contains “no provision for removing a person from office when that person was installed there by a foreign power.”

The memo went on to argue that, if a subpoena is sent to the White House, it will be returned to Mueller and stamped “addressee unknown.”

“A person referred to in a subpoena as ‘President’ Donald J. Trump simply does not exist,” the memo claimed.

1. Super Mario Bros.

Nintendo’s classic adventure about a plumber walking toward a princess is one of the most iconic games of all time, but it is utterly ruined by the presence of enemies. Everywhere you go in the Mushroom Kingdom, bad guys like turtles and sentient fungi are trying to murder you. It’s tons of work to jump around trying to avoid those brutes. Even if you try to stay out of their way by hiding in the sewer, the turtles and fungi go out of their way to ruin your day. If you were a kid in the 1980s, you probably threw your NES in the garbage right after playing Super Mario because there’s no way to win with so many villains milling about and making a nuisance of themselves.

2. Pac-Man

It was loads of fun to control a yellow ball with a mouth, and make it eat drugs and fruit. Pac-Man could have been a wonderful experience, had Namco not made the inexplicable decision to add villainous ghosts to the game. Ghosts, as you may know, are the restless souls of the dead, and are pretty much the last thing you want to see, especially when you’re trying to eat fruit in a maze. Namco only compounded its error by making the ghosts chase Pac-Man and, no joke, try to murder him. Getting murdered by ghosts is not fun at all and ruins what is otherwise an arcade gem.

3. Street Fighter II

Street Fighter II is a virtual vacation simulator that lets you travel around the world to exotic locales like a palace in India, the Amazon rainforest, or a fancy Las Vegas casino. Once your character arrives at their vacation destination, friendly people there stand in the background and cheer at you. Inexplicably, Capcom ruins your globe-trotting trip by including numerous enemies that try to punch and kick you using their martial arts skills. The frustrating control scheme of the game lacks any button to call the police, so you have no way of contacting the authorities for help while you’re mercilessly beaten to within an inch of your life. Street Fighter II is yet another potential gaming masterpiece ruined by the developers’ baffling decision to include villains.

4. Tetris

Finally, an empty room where you can get some peace and quiet. Or so it seems at first. The incredible beginning of Tetris is ruined by evil bricks that begin plummeting from the sky, for no good reason, forcing you to perform manual labor and rotate them into a position where they can be neatly stacked. Video games are supposed to be fun escapism, not brutal toil under a tight deadline. There’s no way to stop the nefarious bricks, because they keep coming no matter how loudly you beg them to stop. Even the jaunty Russian theme song can’t make these unpleasant and unwanted bricks worth dealing with. No doubt there were plenty of disappointed kids who tossed their Gameboys in the garbage after playing Tetris one time.

5. Donkey Kong Country

Another flawed masterpiece from Nintendo, Donkey Kong Country once again ruined a pleasant stroll through the jungle by adding enemies like alligators and bees, all of whom behave very unethically by trying to kill Donkey Kong. Fortunately, clever gamers figured out an exploit to avoid these enemies by walking left at the start of the game into Donkey Kong’s empty banana vault, instead of right. By using the cheat code of only going left, Donkey Kong can stay in his completely safe cave, crying about his stolen bananas, and never encounter any enemies at all. If you threw your SNES in the garbage, you’ll want to fish it out of the trash and reconnect it to your television to experience all the fun of an ape crying in a safe cave.

Uh-uh. Kids should not be that big, no siree,” lead researcher Michael Zimmern explained, adding a low whistle as he glanced at a PowerPoint slide depicting a diagram of a 450-pound 10-year-old’s body. “Our rigorous analysis has led us to conclude that sometimes you just feel it in your bones when something ain’t kosher, and that there ain’t kosher.”

Whether you consider Rajneeshpuram a violent sex cult or a misunderstood community of free thinkers, ‘Wild Wild Country’ is sure to have something for you—so here’s everything you need to know before you sit down and watch.

How interesting to finally know the location where Atari buried its unplayable game’s creators, and if the group’s Kickstarter to go dig up the designers reaches its goal, we might even get a couple of pictures of the mass grave site.",Gaming History Unearthed: Fans Have Located The Desert Mass Grave Where Atari Buried All Of Its Employees Responsible For The ‘E.T.’ Video Game,http://www.clickhole.com/gaming-history-unearthed-fans-have-located-the-desert-1825159311#replies,www.clickhole.com

1. Network neutrality is a complicated topic with a lot of angles to consider, and there’s no sense in gettin’ yourself all in a twist over it. You ain’t been right since you got a hoof to the head, and the concept of internet infrastructure is beyond you. Just you hush and take a look at the water rolling along the bank. Isn’t that pretty?

2. That’s right. Quit your frettin’ about the Federal Communications Commission and how it dances to the beat of big telecom’s drum. You might’ve been able to understand the idea of internet fast lanes back before your accident, but those days are over. Watch the wind blow those reeds from side to side—that right there is all you need to worry about.

3. Did our net neutrality laws allow for democratic access to the internet or prevent corporate competition that would make the industry thrive? That ain’t for you to decide, so don’t you pay those silly questions any mind. Can you hear the birds chirping? Listen close, now. There you go.

4. You’ve got a straightforward nature about you ever since your mishap with that horse you were ridin’, and that ain’t your fault. And it ain’t your fault that your scrambled brain don’t know right from wrong no more. Yes, that’s me crying you’re hearing, but it don’t mean you have to turn around and look. I’m just emotional because this day is so pretty. Now here’s a photo of FCC chairman Ajit Pai, since you’ve been good sitting so calmly. Don’t let him get you all upset. Imagine he’s just another leaf drifting by. You’re gettin’ all tensed up—just relax.

5. All right, then. Even if internet access is going to slow down due to the repeal, it won’t happen just yet. So you just take a look at those turtles over there walking down the bank. Nothin’ much to understand there, is there? Just some turtles. You like turtles, don’t you? Yep, you like ’em just fine. Look at ’em go, walkin’ all around in their little shells. That’s nice. Now you keep your eyes on those turtles and this whole net neutrality issue will be just hunky dory. That noise that sounded like a metal click you just heard behind your ear is just one of them songbird calls. How beautiful they sound this time of year. Just keep looking at them turtles and stay very still. There you go. Good.

1. A guitar

A guitar may not be 100 percent round, but you’ve got to appreciate that it’s pretty close. Sure, guitars have long, straight necks, which aren’t round, but they also have multiple curves, which are classic hallmarks of round items. The bottom line is that you can call a guitar round without being too far off base.

2. A Panama hat

At first Panama hats might not seem round, but when you consider the fact that they aren’t sharp and don’t have any corners, you can see that they have an overall round vibe. If you’re looking for an object that’s pretty much on the round side of things, a Panama hat will usually fit the bill.

3. The pyramids

If it’s not a box, it’s round. The pyramids do not have enough sides to be boxes, so they can safely be considered round.

4. Dirt

Generally, anything you can gather into a big clump is at least 30 or 40 percent round—meaning that dirt makes it at least to the one-yard line as far as roundness goes. Yes, you could probably get rounder, but if you’re looking for a round thing in a pinch, dirt should more or less do the trick.

30,30,,"It’s always amazing to look back at the Nintendo 64 and remember the incredible games that came out during the console’s legendary run. Here are the four best N64 games about giving Bernie Mac a haircut that made the system one of the greatest in gaming history.

1. Hair Farmer: Bernie Mac

Nintendo created Hair Farmer: Bernie Mac in an attempt to replicate the success they had had with the farming simulator Harvest Moon. Hair Farmer: Bernie Mac placed gamers in charge of a small hair farm on top of Bernie Mac’s head where they had to regularly coat Bernie’s scalp in Rogaine to make his hair grow, shampoo it, comb it, and when it got long enough, cut it off and sell it. There was no moment as frustrating as when the game’s soundtrack suddenly changed to Bernie Mac’s booming voice delivering his Live In Vegas stand-up special and his enormous hands would start pounding his head as part of his delivery, sending your farm and supplies flying. This game was endlessly playable and super addictive. Once your farm on Bernie’s head was prospering, the game put you in charge of hair farms all over the rest of his body.

2. Bernie Mac Haircut Simulator ’98

Bernie Mac Haircut Simulator ’98 was the first game on the N64 to simulate the entire Bernie Mac haircutting process, from leading Bernie from the barbershop entrance over to the chair, to making small talk about his 30-year comedy career, to brushing off his neck and handing him a mirror to check out the back of his head. Any N64 owner who owned this title will remember perhaps the game’s most difficult challenge in which Bernie Mac would come into the barbershop on a lunch break in a mad rush to get back to the set of How To Be A Player. Gamers had to give Bernie Mac a haircut in under three minutes as he alternated between chowing down on a Subway six-inch cold-cut combo and falling fast asleep in the barber chair. If Bernie’s haircut wasn’t done right in three minutes, the comedy star would erupt in a fit of rage and players had to try to shoo him out of the barbershop as he toppled supplies onto the floor and threw handfuls of loose hair from off the ground. The game has yet to be matched in terms of straightforward Bernie Mac haircut simulation, and remains a true standout in the N64’s stellar catalog of games.

3. Bernie Mac Cuts His Own Hair

In what many consider to be the most ambitious game about giving Bernie Mac a haircut, Bernie Mac Cuts His Own Hair had players control Bernie Mac’s arms as he cut his own hair while lying down naked in his shower-bath combo. The game was notable for its intense difficulty, and one wrong move could result in Bernie Mac cutting off his own ears or decapitating himself. As the game progressed, Bernie’s wife would knock on the bathroom door asking what he was doing in there and players could select phrases for Bernie Mac to shout back like “I’m making myself look handsome again!” or “Can’t a man ever just cut his own damn hair in peace?” If Bernie Mac took too long to cut his own hair, Bernie Mac’s wife would break the door down and divorce him on the spot.

4. Resident Evil: Bernie Mac’s Haunted Ponytail

Capcom’s 1999 entry in the Resident Evil franchise had players battling their way through a six-mile-long barbershop where the Umbrella Corporation is holding a sedated Bernie Mac in a back room under an experimental hair-regrowth treatment that causes his hair to grow three feet per minute. Seeing Bernie Mac’s writhing ponytail fill the hallways of the dirty, abandoned barbershop as it lurched at the screen in full 3D graphics was an awesome sight. And the final scene in which you finally reach the chained-up Bernie Mac lying in his signature black pinstripe suit, cut his massive ponytail all the way down to his scalp, and behead him with a rusty pair of scissors is still one of the creepiest visuals in Resident Evil history. Resident Evil: Bernie Mac’s Haunted Ponytail might look a little dated by modern gaming standards, but the gameplay is absolutely unmatched, and if you can track down an old N64, the game is definitely well worth a replay.",The 4 Best N64 Games About Giving Bernie Mac A Haircut,http://www.clickhole.com/the-4-best-n64-games-about-giving-bernie-mac-a-haircut-1826362895,www.clickhole.com
31,31,,"Brandon’s dad never comes to soccer games or school field trips and clearly doesn’t live with Brandon and his family, but Brandon is always making up totally dumbass excuses as to why. Here are six reasons Brandon gave for why his dad isn’t around that everyone can tell are grade-A bullshit.



1. He’s on the Olympic basketball team: When Brandon’s dad didn’t come to the sixth-grade production of Into The Woods this month, Brandon made a big show of telling everybody that his dad couldn’t make it because he was busy being a power forward on the U.S. Olympic basketball team. Seriously, Brandon? The last Summer Olympics were a long-ass time ago, and we would have noticed if someone with your last name who looked like you had been competing. We all know your dad isn’t around these days, but we’re not fucking buying that it’s because—at age 43—he made it onto the Olympic basketball team. Jesus Christ, Brandon, do you think we’re all idiots or something?

Advertisement

2. He’s having surgery to get his arm replaced with a super-strong bionic arm: Yeah, this one is some pure goddamn horseshit. The other day when someone asked Brandon if his dad was going to pick him up from soccer practice, he told this elaborate story about how his dad got selected by the U.S. Army to test out a bionic arm it developed strong enough to punch straight through an alligator’s skull. When someone asked him why the U.S. Army would need that, Brandon said that it was so it could finally kill the alligator that assassinated Martin Luther King Jr., but when Kody pointed out that it wouldn’t make sense for Brandon’s dad to be the one to do that since he’s an electrician and not in the military, Brandon just said that he was late for gym class and ran off. We don’t know whether Brandon’s dad got sick, or he left, or he got a job in a different town or something, but it’s pretty obvious that he isn’t at the Pentagon having surgery to get a bionic arm.

3. He had to go into the witness protection program after he saw El Chapo rob a Starbucks: According to Brandon, his dad had to change his name to “Max Desastre” and move to Iceland so that he wouldn’t get murdered for watching El Chapo rob a Starbucks. More fucking likely he had a fight with Brandon’s mom and went down to Florida to live with his older brother for a while.

4. He’s trapped at the top of Kingda Ka: This year when Brandon’s dad didn’t make it to Brandon’s birthday party, Brandon said it was because his dad had been trapped at the top of Kingda Ka for three months and the fire department couldn’t figure out how to get him down. Aside from the fact that there’s no way it would take more than a day to get somebody down from there, Brandon basically used the same excuse last year when he said that his dad got stuck against the wall of the Gravitron ride at the boardwalk and a team of scientists from MIT had to come in and reverse the centripetal force that was pinning him there. Either way, Brandon just needs to own up to the fact that his dad is definitely not living with him at the moment.

Advertisement

5. He became a live-in nurse for Eminem: Brandon, what the fuck? It’s fine that your dad isn’t around for some reason, but stop trying to act like it’s because he’s Eminem’s live-in caretaker. Brandon seems to expect us to believe that Eminem’s agent hired Brandon’s dad to feed Eminem every two hours, because if Eminem gets too hungry he’ll go berserk and write another mean song about his mom. Plus, Brandon keeps adding all these details about how his dad lives in Eminem’s shed, and the shed is full of poisonous spiders, but the poisonous spiders don’t bite his dad because they’re loyal to Eminem and they know he’s Eminem’s friend. Basically, none of that makes any fucking sense, and it’s pretty clear that Brandon is making it up on the fly every time he explains it. This has to be one of Brandon’s all-time most-bullshit excuses for why his dad isn’t around.

6. He’s nocturnal: Brandon obviously only came up with this one after learning about bats’ sleep cycles in science class, and he kind of half-assed it too—all he said was, “You guys haven’t seen my dad at my house because he’s nocturnal,” and left it at that. Here’s a suggestion, Brandon: Try at least waiting till the day after we read a whole textbook chapter on nocturnal animals to come up with a bold-ass lie like this one. And if your dad moved states to try to find work, you can just come out and say that.",6 Reasons Brandon Gave For Why His Dad Isn’t Around That Are Definitely Bullshit,http://www.clickhole.com/6-reasons-brandon-gave-for-why-his-dad-isn-t-around-tha-1825159411,www.clickhole.com

Good on you, H&M. This will go a long way toward ensuring that nobody dies an easily preventable death in any of your stores.

Help is now just a button-push away for those who shop at H&M, should they ever try on a pair of jeans and become so immensely stunned by how well the pants fit that it causes the person to suffer a stroke right there in the store. Gone are the days of having your face droop as your brain struggles to get enough oxygen because it can’t process just how jealous your ex will be when they see how those jeans hug your hips, and it’s the Swedish clothing giant that’s leading the way.



“Here at H&M, we understand that your ass will look so piping hot filling out our jeans and jean shorts that the shock of it all will most likely trigger a blood vessel to rupture inside your brain, thus leading to a massive intracranial hemorrhage and you passing out on the floor,” said H&M CEO Karl-Johan Persson in a shareholder’s call that took place earlier today. “Now people can rest easy knowing that if their life is at risk as they begin convulsing due to how overwhelmingly sexy they find themselves wearing our jeans, they can simply press the button and help will be on the way.”

And it’s good news for H&M’s employees, too. They no longer have to dread cleaning up at the end of the day only to discover someone’s lifeless corpse totally rocking a pair of ultra-cute skinny jeans. And as an added bonus, in the rare event that anyone presses the button and paramedics don’t arrive quickly enough before the stroke causes permanent damage, H&M will take 50 percent off the jeans’ price to make up for the delay, proving that the company is looking out for people both medically and financially.

While critics will argue that H&M should be doing more to help customers who die after having too much sex because they look so damn hot in their jeans, you’ve got to hand it to H&M for this amazing first step.



With Life Alert buttons already installed in every H&M location, customers can try on jeans knowing that they’re in good hands as they stare at their sexy bod in the mirror during the final seconds before their vision completely blurs.

33,33,,"A self-taught musician and visual artist, Grimes has spent almost a decade capturing fans’ hearts with her eclectic, experimental sound. After recent issues with her original record label, 4AD, Grimes has continued to make music, collaborating with artists like Janelle Monáe and working on a fifth, yet-to-be-titled studio album. We sat down with the beloved alternative artist to ask about her experience in the music industry, her visual art, and her high-profile relationship with billionaire Elon Musk.

1. You’ve been critical of the male-dominated pop music production system. Can you give us your thoughts on that?

Absolutely. Given the current skewed industry ratio, all you hear on the radio are pop songs about sex, money, and beautiful women. I’m tired of that—I want to hear more songs about hair braiding, bed sheet thread counts, and flushing sanitary napkins down toilets even though you know you’re not supposed to.

Advertisement

2. Along with being a musician, you’re also a very accomplished visual artist, and you’ve done the cover design on each one of your albums. Do you find that being involved in the visual design of an album is important in achieving the aesthetic you want?

Not really. I mainly do my own design work because I know that if I don’t, my friend who studied graphic design in college will offer to do it, and he’s fucking terrible. Whenever I’m coming out with a new album, I have to tell him shit like “I wouldn’t let Picasso himself design my album art because only I know what I want it to look like,” but the truth is that I’m just trying to let him down easy because he always picks the stupidest-looking script fonts and has pretty much no idea how to cut things out in Photoshop. I’d love to get another artist to contribute artwork for my albums, but it would hurt my friend’s feelings too much, so I just design them myself.

3. A lot of people have been critical of you, an indie artist who frequently touts leftist stances, dating Elon Musk, a billionaire with a reputation for mistreating workers and busting unions. What is your response to that criticism?

I don’t want to speak too much on that because I’ve always liked to let my music do the talking for me, but I will say that once my new album, The Kindness Of The High Prince: He Gives Us Fast Trains, is released, people will better understand where I’m coming from. Once my critics hear the songs I’m working on, like “An Unholy Union (Find Your Own Bootstraps)” and “You Don’t Need A Bathroom Break When You Got A Bedpan,” I think they’ll see that Elon’s actually a really great guy who’s doing important work.

Advertisement

4. On a personal level, are there any other downsides to dating a very famous tech billionaire?

It’s not too bad. The only thing that sucks is when Elon holds me up in the air onstage at a tech conference, claims that I’m the new Tesla model “Girlfriend,” and launches into a PowerPoint presentation about all my specs and features. Other than that, it’s pretty much like any other relationship.

5. Your given name is Claire Elise Boucher. How did you come up with the stage name Grimes?

“Grimes” is a combination of “Grieg,” which is the name of a Norwegian composer whose music was my favorite thing to listen to growing up, and “Sorry, but our theater’s no-outside-food policy extends even to your bag of fresh limes,” which was my least favorite thing to hear growing up. My art deals with joy as well as sorrow, and I thought my name should be a reflection of that.","‘Once My Album “The Kindness Of The High Prince: He Gives Us Fast Trains,” Comes Out, People Will Understand What I See In Elon Musk’: 5 Questions With Grimes",http://www.clickhole.com/once-my-album-the-kindness-of-the-high-prince-he-giv-1827137914,www.clickhole.com

Poor kid. Was it really necessary to broadcast that information to the entire county?

Advertisement

According to the alert, which went out earlier this morning, missing 8-year-old Lucas O’Neil is approximately 4 feet, 5 inches with green eyes, black hair, and is known to answer to the nicknames “Big Lord Beefcake,” and sometimes “The King Of Pork,” when he’s at school, which honestly seem like pretty unnecessary details to add to an urgent text message sent out to pretty much every cell phone in northern Wisconsin. Sure, these characteristics could theoretically help track Lucas down, but including that he was “last seen wearing a shirt with huge mustard stains all over it” and that “his classmates say he has a very distinct hamlike smell” mostly just feels like adding insult to injury.

At the end of the day, if someone ends up finding Lucas by asking him, “Are you Big Lord Beefcake?” then great, but you’ve got to admit that that’s pretty unlikely, and now that nickname is just kind of out there whether this poor kid likes it or not.

This is definitely a heartbreaking situation, but we’re hoping Big Lord Beefcake gets home soon, even though this Amber Alert is probably the most humiliating thing to ever happen to him, and everyone at his school will probably taunt him mercilessly about it for years to come.",Probably Unnecessary: This Amber Alert Mentions That The Missing Kid’s Nickname At School Is ‘Big Lord Beefcake’,http://www.clickhole.com/probably-unnecessary-this-amber-alert-mentions-that-th-1826520029,www.clickhole.com

After an eventful morning at Zoo Atlanta’s giant-panda enclosure, a team of weeping, blood-soaked researchers has announced that the music of Phil Collins makes pandas kill each other!

Wow! What an incredible revelation about one of the world’s most beloved animals.



Advertisement

The groundbreaking discovery was made earlier today when a team of five zoologists turned on a Phil Collins Pandora station to listen to while they checked the animals’ vitals and accidentally triggered almost 15 minutes of unhinged bloodletting amongst the four giant pandas currently living in captivity at Zoo Atlanta. At first, the scientists weren’t sure what had caused the peaceful mammals to suddenly commit brutal familicide, but when female panda Ya Lun attempted to crush her father’s skull in perfect synchronization with the big drum fill of Collins’ 1981 hit “In The Air Tonight,” everything started to make sense to the rattled researchers.



“Based on the images and sounds that now haunt me even when my eyes are open, I am able to confirm that the music of prolific singer-songwriter Phil Collins turns pandas into soulless demons whose most desperate desire is to annihilate their own species in shocking and frankly creative ways,” announced team lead Samuel Hawthorne, who was found wandering several feet from the panda enclosure covered in animal viscera. Hawthorne retired from the field of animal research shortly after making this historic statement.



So awesome! And that’s not all—according to reports cobbled together from the crazed mutterings of the rest of the research team, songs by Phil Collins’ band Genesis actually seemed to stimulate a more controlled murderous rage in the pandas, resulting in slower actions like tearing and squeezing, whereas the Tarzan soundtrack triggered complete and total dissociative homicidal madness. This just goes to show that no matter how far science has come, we are still learning new things every day about the world around us. We hope that Hawthorne’s team will be released from trauma care so they can keep blowing our minds for years to come!

37,37,,"As the first-ever rapper to have three singles in the Billboard Hot 100’s Top 10 simultaneously, Cardi B is nothing if not an icon. Her meteoric rise to fame took place in part on social media, and her offbeat, fast-talking persona has endeared her to fans all over the world. We sat down with Cardi to ask her about her career in music, her past work as a stripper, her prospects on TV, and more.

1. You owe much of your celebrity to your presence on Instagram. Do you think social media has forever changed how artists are discovered?

It definitely has—but the problem for artists trying to get noticed on social media is that for every talented person on Instagram, there are thousands of accounts that just post videos of completely shaved ferrets. It’s hard to get noticed when there are countless hairless-ferret Instagrams out there with millions of followers each, all putting out incredible naked-ferret content that no rapper, singer, or artist could ever hope to compete with. I mean, these ferrets are like mobile penises that can climb and eat and communicate with each other. It doesn’t get more engaging than that. I saw one video where 16 different shaved ferrets that were loose in a TJ Maxx all climbed onto an old lady at the same time. Good luck having your posts go viral with that as your competition.

2. You were a stripper for a long time before breaking through in hip-hop. Was it difficult to transition into rapping full time?

It was actually a really easy transition. Stripping and rapping are surprisingly similar. Both are jobs. Both happen on a stage. Both require entertaining an audience full of people who are too pissed off to pay any attention because they just found out the venue doesn’t have anywhere they can order a plate of meatballs. So yeah, not too much had to change on my end when I made the switch.

3. Who are your biggest influences in hip-hop?

I was inspired to become a rapper when I was 12 years old and I heard Rodney Dangerfield’s single “Rappin’ Rodney” for the first time. It’s an incredible track about how Rodney is too old and unattractive to get any respect. I heard the line “I was an ugly kid, I never had fun / They took me to a dog show and I won,” and I just thought: Wow. I never knew you could express yourself like that using music. To this day, it’s the only hip-hop music I have ever listened to and my No. 1 inspiration.

4. You were a breakout star of Love & Hip Hop: New York. Do you think you’ll ever return to reality TV?

I’m not sure. I would only do reality TV if I could star in this show I thought up where a group of competitive hot-dog eaters compete for my love. At the end of the show there would be a big twist where I would reveal that guys who can eat lots of hot dogs are actually a big turnoff for me, and then I would end up marrying the one guy who really sucked at eating hot dogs and could only manage a few bites of one before giving up. Anyways, I’m currently engaged to the rapper Offset, but I’d also be willing to marry a guy with a weak stomach who I’d meet on TV.

5. How did you come up with the name Cardi B?

The letters in Cardi stand for “Cockles,” “Atlantic bay scallops,” “Razor clams,” “Dredge oysters,” and “Ischadium recurvum,” which are the only animals on earth that I respect. “B” originally stood for bivalves, which is the category all those creatures fall into, but now I’d say it could also stand for “Blue mussels,” because I Googled those the other day and I was pretty impressed by their sturdy shells.",‘The Hardest Part Of Getting Famous Was Competing With Viral Instagram Videos Of Shaved Ferrets’: 5 Questions With Cardi B,http://www.clickhole.com/the-hardest-part-of-getting-famous-was-competing-with-1825358175#replies,www.clickhole.com
38,38,,"With 18 previous movies and countless characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it’s no wonder fans are worried about feeling lost during the newly released Avengers: Infinity War—and there’s no way you’ll understand the movie unless you’re all caught up on the full background nuances of Jesus Christ’s gospel of grace and mercy. If you’re thinking about buying a ticket for Infinity War, check out this list first: It’ll tell you everything you need to know about the endless love and compassion of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ so you’ll be able to understand exactly what’s going on in Avengers: Infinity War.

1. Christ empowers the righteous and gives strength to those who serve Him faithfully, which is why Thor can still fight even though he has lost his hammer

When you sit down to watch Infinity War, you’ll want to know this right off the bat: Beloved Marvel character Thor’s powerful hammer was destroyed in previous Marvel film Thor: Ragnarok, but Thor can still fight alongside the Avengers thanks to the strength he draws from Jesus Christ, the son of God. During Infinity War, you might find yourself wondering how Thor is managing to fight the evil Thanos without his mighty hammer, but just remember that it is because through God’s holy will that Thor is able to vanquish his enemies.

2. Jesus Christ loves even the wicked and seeks to bring all stray sheep back to his blessed flock, which is why He loves Thanos despite his evil ways

An uninformed viewer might assume that a murderous tyrant like the evil Thanos has surely been forsaken by Christ. But that’s where you’d be wrong! The fact is, the mercy of our Lord and savior knows no bounds, and even the fallen among us may yet be saved. If you’re planning on seeing Infinity War, then this part of the gospel provides the backstory necessary for understanding why even though Thanos has wandered so far astray from Christ’s righteous path, he may yet earn a place by Christ’s side in the Kingdom of Heaven.

3. Bruce Banner won’t experience internal peace until he accepts Christ as his savior

If you’re not familiar with The Hulk, you’re going to want to read up on the Gospels before you see Infinity War. Basically, The Hulk is actually a man named Bruce Banner whose rage turns him into a hulking green monster because he does not know how to experience the peace that comes with accepting Jesus Christ into one’s heart. When you’re feeling confused about why The Hulk has entered one of his rage-filled rampages, just remember that he is acting violently because he has not yet embraced the endless peace and grace that Christ offers to all who recognize Him as their Lord and redeemer.

4. Satan seeks to tempt the weak-willed among us to embrace a life of sin, which is why Loki often betrays the Avengers

If you’re new to the Marvel Universe, you’ll probably be confused about why Thor’s treacherous brother Loki frequently betrays the Avengers whenever it suits his own selfish purposes. In order to understand why Loki behaves this way, you just need to remember this one thing about the teachings of Jesus Christ: Although Jesus’s love for mankind is without end, and His divine will is an inviolable force for good, still the accursed Lucifer, the Fallen One, is full of hate, and seeks at all times to corrupt our souls and induce us to a life of sin. Satan is forever tempting Loki to a life of wickedness, which is why, even though he often does the right thing, the Avengers can never fully trust him as a true ally.

Wow. Hopefully no one you know or love is currently eating romaine lettuce, because it’s pizza time!

In a statement released earlier today, the CDC urged Americans to throw out any and all romaine lettuce bought in the past week because it’s time for some cheesy, piping-hot pizza with all your favorite toppings! The agency’s statement also warns that anybody who consumes romaine salad products of any kind puts themselves at serious risk of missing out on pizza time, because you know that fresh ’za and all the bread sticks and dipping sauces are going to go fast!

Romaine lettuce distributors have also halted production at their facilities, wanting to be very cautious that they not make the problem of Americans failing to realize it’s time for the cheesy treat known as pizza even worse.



Unfortunately, thousands of Americans have probably already consumed romaine lettuce before the CDC could issue the recall, so be sure to spread the word to family and friends so none of them spoil their appetite eating romaine lettuce when all the pizza they can handle is on the way!",Public Alert: The CDC Has Issued A Recall For All Romaine Lettuce Because It’s Time For Pizza!,http://www.clickhole.com/public-alert-the-cdc-has-issued-a-recall-for-all-romai-1825476860#replies,www.clickhole.com

In a shocking turn of events, the iconic broadcaster is being forced to resign from MSNBC after leaked documents have revealed that he’s a hillbilly.



What a shame. There’s simply no coming back from a scandal this damning.

Earlier this morning, a series of incriminating images emerged on the internet showing a barefoot Williams wearing patched blue overalls while holding a jug of peach schnapps with his trusty three-legged bloodhound by his side, leaving MSNBC no choice but to take action and end its relationship with the troubled newsman. Since then a deluge of additional leaks has surfaced confirming that the man known to fellow hillbillies as Brian Moonshine appears to be nothing short of a true slack-jawed yokel, amongst the evidence an email exchange between Brian and a staffer in which he recounts the time he got struck by lightning while chasing a greased hog up a hill.

While at first the network considered suspending Williams until the outcry subsided, it ultimately decided to cut ties altogether, as his sudden fall from grace was only accelerated after the public caught wind of video footage from 2003 of the formerly esteemed anchor shouting “Yeehaw!” and repeatedly firing his rifle into the air upon killing a varmint for that night’s dinner. Unfortunately for him few peers came to his defense, as the documents asserted that there was an instance in 2012 when Brian pulled his floppy hat down over his eyes and took a nap at the base of an old oak tree after interviewing people cleaning up after Hurricane Sandy in Atlantic City, all but shattering his remaining credibility.

“In light of these recent revelations, we have no choice but to part ways, as we at MSNBC were dismayed as anyone to hear the audio recordings of Mr. Williams hooting and hollering after getting his hand stuck in a wasp’s nest,” said MSNBC president Phil Griffin in a press release issued just moments ago. “We wish Brian luck in the future, and apologize to our audience that we were not previously made aware of his penchant for chewing on stems of wheat.”

Wow, what an embarrassing turn of events. Though you’ve got to give MSNBC credit for how it handled this less-than-stellar situation.

The social media behemoth just announced that it’s scrambling to beef up security after discovering millions of users who have falsely listed their education as “School of Hard Knocks,” a university that does not seem to exist in any accredited capacity.

Yikes. Facebook’s mistakes just keep on coming.

Company CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed today that an internal investigation into the platform’s vulnerabilities identified more than 8 million accounts boasting the fraudulent education bona fides, many of which listed other suspicious personal information including being a “CEO at Self-Employed” and “In a relationship with Netflix.” A staggering 30 percent of these accounts even listed Jesus Christ as their employer and still managed to go undetected until now, raising serious questions about Facebook’s ability to address what appear to be widespread flaws in its security protocol.

“While the endgame of these deceptive accounts is still unclear, this suspicious activity has all the hallmarks of a coordinated campaign by a third party to manipulate users and erode trust in the Facebook community,” Zuckerberg wrote in an official blog post. “We’re swiftly making a number of improvements to better detect these ‘School of Hard Knocks’ accounts, as well as similarly deceitful accounts with education credentials like ‘Studied Beer at Party University’ and ‘PhD in Getting Laid.’”

Zuckerberg warned that it could take months to weed out these fake accounts, but he listed a number of warning signs users could look for in the meantime, including incorrectly sized profile pictures where the user is posing next to an exotic car they clearly don’t own and frequent posts reporting achievements in Candy Crush Saga.

44,44,,"Online dating can be a serious headache, and it’s more likely you’ll find yourself stuck in an endless cycle of dead-end first dates than in a compatible match. But if you’re experiencing dating app fatigue, don’t lose hope of finding that special someone just yet, because Facebook just announced a brand-new dating feature that will finally allow you to romantically connect with your dad’s friend who likes all of your posts even though you’ve never met him.

Adios, Tinder! Looks like Facebook is about to take the online dating game to a whole new level.

Advertisement

Unveiled yesterday at Facebook’s annual F8 developer conference, the social media platform’s incredible new opt-in dating feature will finally give users what has until now never existed in a matchmaking service: the opportunity to enter an intimate relationship with that guy named Wayne or Randy who was friends with your dad growing up and now seemingly spends all his time on Facebook liking vacation photos of strangers three decades his junior and blindly sharing all the sassy Tweety Bird memes and unsourced news articles about product recalls that come across his newsfeed. With comparatively miniscule subscriber pools, apps like Tinder and Hinge have never been able to adequately serve those who wish to send flirty messages to 62-year-old strangers with improperly uploaded profile pictures of themselves posing next to Corvettes, but Facebook, with more than two billion active users, is readily equipped to facilitate romantic trysts between eager young singles and retired truck drivers who used to drop cherry bombs down toilets with your dad and now constantly use the internet to share typo-riddled posts about how the world was much better before the internet.

“Facebook has the capacity to connect people better than any other product in the history of the world, and today we’re proud to announce an extraordinary new dating service that will empower our users to find lasting love with grizzled old baby boomers who you’ve never met but who will often leave unprovoked comments on your 10-year-old vacation photos at two in the morning saying things like, ‘wow looks fun beautiful family rick,’ or simply just typing their own name for some reason,” announced Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg during a keynote address. “Not only will our feature be able to do everything that existing dating apps do, but it will also grant users access to a whole new world of retirement-age weirdos with Snoopy profile photo frames who are single and ready to mingle.”

The Facebook dating app, set to be released later this year, boasts a bevy of proprietary matchmaking tools that don’t exist on any other mobile-focused dating services, including a filter that detects appreciation for things like the Doobie Brothers and Bob Evans early-bird specials, to ensure that users aren’t just being paired with like-minded individuals from their own age group but also belligerently conservative Vietnam vets with penchants for wishing friends happy birthday in stand-alone posts because they don’t realize they can share directly to someone’s wall. Although Facebook has suffered significant damage to its reputation over the past year, a successful rollout of a dating app that effectively pairs users with lurking old men from their father’s boyhood could be just what the company needs to atone for its missteps and restore its credibility to the public at large.

If you’re tired of being disappointed over and over by the same old dating apps, then this new Facebook service might be just what you need to make you believe in love again.

“There is a strong legal precedent in this court to callously validate unjust and discriminatory laws for the convenience of those in power, and with that in mind, we have ruled in favor of the Trump administration’s proposed travel ban,” wrote Chief Justice John G. Roberts in the majority opinion. “We cite here myriad cases throughout American history when this court has just absolutely fucking miffed it when it came to obvious ethical decisions, per such rulings as Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), in which this court ruled to legalize racial segregation, and Buck v.

Bradley Horne was flying from the U.K. to Washington, D.C. on what should have been an otherwise easy airplane trip. But when he boarded the plane with a briefcase containing an improvised explosive device, a flight attendant took the bag from him and carelessly stowed it in a crammed overhead bin. Just 20 minutes into the flight during some turbulence, the bomb in the overloaded compartment exploded to the point that it was completely unrecognizable, and unusable to boot.

United, we’re willing to let a few missteps slide, but passengers shouldn’t be walking onto planes with their bombs intact and walking off with them blown to smithereens. You’re going to have to win our trust back after this one.

To its credit, United was quick to offer an apology to Horne over social media after the flight landed. “We accept total responsibility for this unfortunate accident, and we are deeply sorry for the pain and stress that the loss of this improvised explosive device caused Mr. Horne,” said Sharon Regan, a spokesperson for the airline. “Nothing would make us happier than if he had been able to land in DC with his bomb intact, but unfortunately, accidents happen, and all we can do is work hard to be more careful with the bombs that customers bring onto our planes in the future.”

Right on! This will go a long way to ensuring gamers around the world aren’t desensitized to violence.

Advertisement

With this latest update, each time a kill is logged in Fortnite’s “Battle Royale” mode, the game will pause and a cutscene will take players to a chapel where they will watch a moving, 45-minute memorial service of the deceased character, including eulogies from friends and family and a graveside burial service. Once gamers have contemplated the finality of death by watching the fallen character’s body being lowered into the ground, they will return to Fortnite’s exhilarating gameplay until another kill is logged and they are once again shown a cutscene of the fallen character’s funeral.

Fortnite gamers who are used to mindlessly logging headshot after headshot without ever reflecting on the life of the characters they’re killing will now hear about the Recon Scout’s dedication to Christ and the church mission he served in the Philippines during a moving eulogy delivered by his weeping, digitally-rendered mother. And players who would otherwise take out a Plasma Specialist with a C4 trap without a second thought will now watch her tear-stricken husband stand over her coffin and speak about the New England summer home she had always dreamed of retiring to.

“By attending 100 full-length funeral services over the course of a single match, we feel confident gamers will learn that every person’s life, whether an Outlander or Ninja, is unique and has value,” explained Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. “After sitting among numerous congregations of animated mourners and hearing their sorrowful sobs, players will return to the game map with a greater respect for those they’ve killed and a more profound perspective on life.”

52,52,,"When police arrested a man they believed to be the Golden State Killer yesterday, the world celebrated as one of history’s most brutal and notorious serial killers was finally captured more than 40 years after his reign of terror began. However, it sadly looks like justice will have to wait for another day: the police have released the Golden State Killer from custody because he was just too creepy to be around.

Devastating. It looks like this notorious killer is once again on the loose.

Authorities announced today that after arresting 72-year-old Joseph James DeAngelo based on DNA evidence identifying him as the Golden State Killer, they were forced to release him early this morning because he was giving everyone at the station a serious case of the heebie-jeebies. According to reports, DeAngelo was just freaky to look at, and officers didn’t like having him in custody because it seemed like he was reading their thoughts every time he looked at them with his spooky eyes.

Advertisement

Detectives on the case say they tried to interrogate DeAngelo, but decided against it because they could just tell that once he started confessing, he’d probably start licking his lips and get all weird and call his victims his “little playthings” or something fucked up like that.

“We’ve released Joseph James DeAngelo from custody because honestly, this whole story freaks us out and after getting a good look at the guy, we’d rather not hear his raspy voice give us all the creepy details of his crimes.” said Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones. “He looked like the kind of guy that could start laughing maniacally at any moment, and we were worried that if we kept this freaky weirdo in a jail cell too much longer, he was going to do something really messed up like just start reciting details about our kids and spouses, and ultimately we determined the best course of action was to get him the hell out of here.”

“We have officers on the force who have to work the late shift, and we absolutely do not want to have to be alone in the same building with this eerie fucker in the middle of the night,” Jones added.

Sheriff Jones then went on to explain that during their decades-long investigations into the Golden State Killer case, the police department had deliberately avoided DeAngelo’s house because everyone on the force agreed that he gave them a serious case of the willies and just looking at his house sent chills up their spine.

Wow. This is heartbreaking. Just when it seemed like the Golden State Killer would finally be brought to justice, he has evaded capture once again.

Yes, R! A mark signifying only the most illicit of amusements! Gather, comrades, gather! Drink ye now from the cup that I have filled at the well of dark knowledge.

1. 300

Advertisement

Never shall I forget the All Hallow’s Eve of my sixth year, the day that I first entered the great untried realm of R-rated movies. It was during a slumber party at my playmate Brayden’s house, where we naughtily succumbed to the temptations of his father’s Blu-ray copy of 300. And let me tell you, comrades, it was like nothing I had ever experienced—a relentless onslaught of vulgarities my virgin ears had not yet heard, eroticism my eyes had not yet seen, and savage acts of violence that eclipsed even the most violent of Power Rangers episodes. I rarely blinked as I watched, too exhilarated by the barrage of morbid stimulants flashing on screen before me. That night, my innocence was left behind on the bloody sands of Thermopylae. I was born anew.

2. American Pie

Advertisement

I was able to behold this marvelous R-rated romp on the Starz channel one day last summer while my parents were preoccupied having wine in the backyard with neighbors. And, o, what a tremendous joy it was! The movie follows five adolescent boys who, filled with excessive activity of blood and nerve, passionately seek to express their puberties upon vaginas, yet are frequently thwarted. One boy makes trouble upon a pie with his engorged genitals! Another diarrheas loudly and is ostracized! In one particularly compelling scene, a girl who speaks poor English becomes naked and tinkers with her groin, which, curiously, produced sordid radiations from my own groin as I watched. Unconsciously, I began vigorously rubbing my boyhood through my dungarees until it became chapped and had to desist. That certainly never happens during PG movies! Even though I did not at any point understand what was happening in American Pie, I nonetheless found it to be utterly magnificent.

3. The Passion Of The Christ

Advertisement

A curious film, this one. My dad invited me to watch it with anticipation that it would be integral to my spiritual development to observe a stylized interpretation of our Savior’s anguish, but alas, my soul remained unstirred. Yet, as is proper for American lads my age, I am sick and giddy with bloodlust, and I’m pleased to report that this movie was amply rewarding in its gore. For 126 consecutive minutes, our Lord is paraded through a labyrinth of suffering, His holy blood squirting hither and yon in such excess that your correspondent could not help but mutter, “Whoa,” again and again. The Romans, they flogged our Lord! They hit our Lord with a stick! They hurt our Lord in so many imaginative and spectacular ways that I could never have conceived on my own, providing rich inspiration for the violence I myself choreograph between my action figures when playing in the bathtub (never would it have occurred to me to have my Buzz Lightyear toy crucify my Greedo toy!). For those with a taste for gratuitous carnage and exceedingly creative acts of torture, I heartily recommend this R-rated bloodbath.



4. Sausage Party

Advertisement

Never has my bosom gladdened quite as it did the moment my mother granted me permission to watch Sausage Party on Netflix, she mistaking it for an animated children’s film instead of the glorious carnival of obscenities that it is. Believe me, comrades, when I say that this film is one of mankind’s crowning artistic achievements, peer only to the Sistine frescoes and the sonnets of the immortal bard. Each and every frame offers a new comedic treasure that would leave me convulsing uncontrollably with mirth, whether it was an anthropomorphic hot dog making whoopee with a voluptuous bun or a wheelchair-riding bolus of chewing gum spouting mathematical theorems. And, yet, for all the many smiles, the movie is also a powerful and haunting audit of the human condition, depicting the horrid realities of these modern times with devastating clarity. One character, a living bagel, is a profound embodiment of the Jewish experience in all its glory and suffering. Another character, a living box of grits, serves as a brutally honest portrait of life as a black man in America. I tell you, comrades, this movie changed me. It is one continuous hallelujah from start to finish.

5. Texas Chainsaw 3D

Advertisement

Surely there is no movie in all of human history more terrifying than this, Texas Chainsaw 3D, which I also watched at Brayden’s house. While I was delighted to discover that there were boobs in this movie—both big boobs and little boobs, all of them pleasing in their contours—the primal joy of gazing upon mammaries was dwarfed by the film’s myriad horrors, which were likely devised in the hideous mind of Lucifer himself. In the movie, a monster named Leatherface methodically slaughters all of the other characters one by one with his fearsome chainsaw, leaving yours truly crippled with fear, as if I, too, were but a fattened ox awaiting the butcher’s blade. Although I could not summon the courage to entertain the film in its entirety—instead retiring to my sleeping bag under the guise that I was weary—the hour or so that I did watch forced me to reckon with my own mortality in a way I never had before. I had known that sometimes in this world, a man must lay down his life for his principles, but until Texas Chainsaw 3D, I had not realized that oftentimes men must die for no reason at all. Death is a capricious and unsentimental brute who summons us per his whims, caring not whether you’re emperor or slave, adult or child. He is looming always, and what choice do I have but to be ready for my own death at every minute of every day?

United, we’re willing to let a few missteps slide, but passengers shouldn’t be walking onto planes with their bombs intact and walking off with them blown to smithereens. You’re going to have to win our trust back after this one.

To its credit, United was quick to offer an apology to Horne over social media after the flight landed. “We accept total responsibility for this unfortunate accident, and we are deeply sorry for the pain and stress that the loss of this improvised explosive device caused Mr. Horne,” said Sharon Regan, a spokesperson for the airline. “Nothing would make us happier than if he had been able to land in DC with his bomb intact, but unfortunately, accidents happen, and all we can do is work hard to be more careful with the bombs that customers bring onto our planes in the future.”

57,57,,"As your children grow up, sometimes a guy will sneak into their bedroom to teach them inaccurate information about James Bond in Spanish. Here are four warning signs that this is happening.

1. Your child wakes you up at 3 a.m. to tell you, “James Bond conduce un poder dinozordo” (rough translation: “James Bond rides around inside of a Mecha-Dinosaur of Immense Power”): If your child has ever run into your room in the middle of the night yelling excitedly about James Bond’s “poder dinozordo,” then it’s very likely that they’re being taught that James Bond is one of the Power Rangers in Spanish from somebody sneaking into their room at night. This kind of misinformation can skew a child’s understanding of James Bond, and as their parent, it’s critical that you get out in front of it and explain to your child that a mech dinosaur robot is not among James Bond’s gadgets.

2. Your child has mentioned over dinner that their “night teacher” told them that “La bebida signatura de James Bond es un galón de leche” (rough translation: “James Bond’s signature drink is a gallon of milk”): You should be very concerned if your child ever turns to you and says, “Usted tiene que saber que la leche mas vieja que quince años es la bebida signatura para James Bond y la leche nueva mataría James Bond” (rough translation: “You are required to know that James Bond’s signature drink is milk that is more than 15 years old, and new milk would kill James Bond”). This is a strong indicator that someone is teaching your child in Spanish that James Bond prefers to drink an entire gallon of milk instead of his signature martini.

3. When you mention James Bond being a ladies’ man, your child explains with a smile that it’s “porque es un eunuco” (rough translation: “because he is a eunuch”): A child is not going to just up and believe that James Bond is a eunuch on their own. If your child starts explaining to you in Spanish that women lust after James Bond because he was castrated by the British government in order to make sure he never tries to have sex with the queen, then this is a big warning sign that someone has been sneaking into their room at night and feeding these kinds of falsehoods into their head.

4. Your child suddenly refuses to wear anything but wide-waisted overalls, a sunhat, and gardening gloves because “Señor Bond viste estas ropas para matar a sus enimigos” (rough translation: “Mr. Bond wears these clothes in order to kill his enemies”): This is a sure sign that somebody is teaching your child that “Señor Bond” dresses in gardening clothes instead of his iconic black tuxedo. Sit your child down and pop in any one of the 25 James Bond films available to help them understand that James Bond doesn’t dress like an elderly gardener. You don’t want your child reaching adulthood and still carrying a hand shovel and pockets full of seed packets because someone who snuck into their room each night taught them in Spanish that that’s how James Bond dresses. As their parent, it’s up to you to set them straight.",4 Signs That Someone Is Sneaking Into Your Child’s Room At Night To Teach Them Inaccurate Information About James Bond In Spanish,http://www.clickhole.com/4-signs-that-someone-is-sneaking-into-your-child-s-room-1826362715,www.clickhole.com

Enjoy not feeling the years slipping through your fingers like sand, because you have no way of knowing which infant is all grown up and behind the wheel!

You saw and LOVED this classic movie long ago, back when this famous baby turning 16 seemed like an eternity away, more than enough time for you to get that job you wanted and travel to all those countries you marked on the old map hanging on your bedroom wall. Well, that baby is now vehicle-legal, and if we irresponsibly told you the movie, you’d realize how much time had passed since your youth, when life seemed so full of possibility, and you would sink into a deep depression about how you squandered all those good years. And for what?



Tragically, we ourselves know the identity of the cinema baby who can now drive, and we feel old. We feel gray and withered, because the baby that seemed like yesterday is in fact the baby of distant past. We’re not ready to feel old, but we feel old, and that is our cross to bear. We shall keep you from our horrid fate until our dying breath.

As long as we are able, we vow to protect your fragile psyche from the horrors of the baby who time transformed into an automobile owner, and when this long-ago baby turns 21, we will not post him or her partying up with their young friends in Vegas.

65,65,,"With 18 previous movies and countless characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it’s no wonder fans are worried about feeling lost during the newly released Avengers: Infinity War—and there’s no way you’ll understand the movie unless you’re all caught up on the full background nuances of Jesus Christ’s gospel of grace and mercy. If you’re thinking about buying a ticket for Infinity War, check out this list first: It’ll tell you everything you need to know about the endless love and compassion of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ so you’ll be able to understand exactly what’s going on in Avengers: Infinity War.

1. Christ empowers the righteous and gives strength to those who serve Him faithfully, which is why Thor can still fight even though he has lost his hammer

When you sit down to watch Infinity War, you’ll want to know this right off the bat: Beloved Marvel character Thor’s powerful hammer was destroyed in previous Marvel film Thor: Ragnarok, but Thor can still fight alongside the Avengers thanks to the strength he draws from Jesus Christ, the son of God. During Infinity War, you might find yourself wondering how Thor is managing to fight the evil Thanos without his mighty hammer, but just remember that it is because through God’s holy will that Thor is able to vanquish his enemies.

2. Jesus Christ loves even the wicked and seeks to bring all stray sheep back to his blessed flock, which is why He loves Thanos despite his evil ways

An uninformed viewer might assume that a murderous tyrant like the evil Thanos has surely been forsaken by Christ. But that’s where you’d be wrong! The fact is, the mercy of our Lord and savior knows no bounds, and even the fallen among us may yet be saved. If you’re planning on seeing Infinity War, then this part of the gospel provides the backstory necessary for understanding why even though Thanos has wandered so far astray from Christ’s righteous path, he may yet earn a place by Christ’s side in the Kingdom of Heaven.

3. Bruce Banner won’t experience internal peace until he accepts Christ as his savior

If you’re not familiar with The Hulk, you’re going to want to read up on the Gospels before you see Infinity War. Basically, The Hulk is actually a man named Bruce Banner whose rage turns him into a hulking green monster because he does not know how to experience the peace that comes with accepting Jesus Christ into one’s heart. When you’re feeling confused about why The Hulk has entered one of his rage-filled rampages, just remember that he is acting violently because he has not yet embraced the endless peace and grace that Christ offers to all who recognize Him as their Lord and redeemer.

4. Satan seeks to tempt the weak-willed among us to embrace a life of sin, which is why Loki often betrays the Avengers

If you’re new to the Marvel Universe, you’ll probably be confused about why Thor’s treacherous brother Loki frequently betrays the Avengers whenever it suits his own selfish purposes. In order to understand why Loki behaves this way, you just need to remember this one thing about the teachings of Jesus Christ: Although Jesus’s love for mankind is without end, and His divine will is an inviolable force for good, still the accursed Lucifer, the Fallen One, is full of hate, and seeks at all times to corrupt our souls and induce us to a life of sin. Satan is forever tempting Loki to a life of wickedness, which is why, even though he often does the right thing, the Avengers can never fully trust him as a true ally. Remember this important fact about the gospel, and Infinity War will make a lot more sense!","Before You Go See ‘Avengers: Infinity War,’ Here’s Everything You Need To Know About The Endless Love And Compassion Of Our Lord And Savior Jesus Christ<em><",http://www.clickhole.com/before-you-go-see-avengers-infinity-war-here-s-ever-1825566310,www.clickhole.com
66,66,,"They aren’t all the way round, but if you’re looking for five things that are pretty much round, here’s a handy list.

1. A guitar

Advertisement

A guitar may not be 100 percent round, but you’ve got to appreciate that it’s pretty close. Sure, guitars have long, straight necks, which aren’t round, but they also have multiple curves, which are classic hallmarks of round items. The bottom line is that you can call a guitar round without being too far off base.

2. A Panama hat

Advertisement

At first Panama hats might not seem round, but when you consider the fact that they aren’t sharp and don’t have any corners, you can see that they have an overall round vibe. If you’re looking for an object that’s pretty much on the round side of things, a Panama hat will usually fit the bill.

3. The pyramids

Advertisement

If it’s not a box, it’s round. The pyramids do not have enough sides to be boxes, so they can safely be considered round.

4. Dirt

Advertisement

Generally, anything you can gather into a big clump is at least 30 or 40 percent round—meaning that dirt makes it at least to the one-yard line as far as roundness goes. Yes, you could probably get rounder, but if you’re looking for a round thing in a pinch, dirt should more or less do the trick.

67,67,,"There’s a complicated situation currently unfolding between an usher and a few teenagers during a showing of Ocean’s 8, and it’s snowballing into a whole big chaotic thing. Here are all the major players involved.

1. The teen who started sobbing as soon as she got there: There’s no doubt that this is someone to keep your eye on. She started off without much action, but during a preview for Mowgli, her boyfriend texted her and broke up with her because he found out that she had a pimple. She started crying and swearing very loudly but chose to remain in the theater, and she’s been an integral part of this whole situation ever since.



Advertisement

2. The usher: In terms of the commotion unfolding during this showing of Ocean’s 8, the usher is key. He’s 40, he’s making his way toward the sobbing teenage girl to ask her to please exit the theater, and he’s holding several-dozen soft pretzels that he took from the concession stand because the whole pretzel machine fell on the floor and he figured the best solution to that was just to carry the dirty pretzels around with him for the rest of the day.

3. The teen who angrily FaceTimed the other teen’s ex: She’s obviously the leader of the two teens, and she takes that responsibility seriously. As the muscle of the operation, she ignored the request to keep all phones silent and immediately FaceTimed the kid who just dumped her friend. Even though the usher is on his way and telling her to hang up, she’s staying on the phone and keeps telling both the ex and the usher that she’s going to “pull a jewel heist on both of [their] asses.” There can be no doubt that this teen is an absolute heavyweight in the events that are unfolding in the audience of Ocean’s 8.

4. The couple that’s making out something fierce at the end of the aisle between the teens and the usher: These two are making out and they’re way too into it to let the usher through, so they’re preventing him from getting close enough to the teens to actually make them turn their phones off. For the most part, they’re too absorbed in their own PDA to be fully aware of anything that’s going on around them, but that doesn’t mean they’re not influencing how this situation is going down.

Advertisement

5. The old man who keeps yelling out that Ben-Hur is much better than this movie: He’s not really an active member of the action, but he’s there in the back yelling about how great Ben-Hur is, as if he thinks the projectionist will hear him and switch out Ocean’s 8 for Ben-Hur. Also, one of the teens is keeping her purse on his lap for some reason. They’re sitting super far away from each other, and they don’t seem to know each other. He’s just holding onto her purse while he yells about Ben-Hur.

6. The kid trying to leave to go to the bathroom but who can’t get through the whole group of people so he’s standing silently to the side peeing himself: This kid desperately needs to pee, but he can’t make it past everyone, so now he’s just stuck listening to the Ben-Hur guy rant about how a movie isn’t worth shit unless the filmmakers kill a bunch of horses during production. For now he’s still on the sidelines pissing himself, but who knows if he’ll enter the fray down the road.

7. The jeweler who is incredibly upset about the disrespect toward jewels portrayed in Ocean’s 8: This man is a total dark horse. He stayed out of play for more than half of Ocean’s 8, but when Mindy Kaling’s character altered a stolen Cartier necklace, he went absolutely apeshit and started screaming about how Ocean’s 8 was a movie that was “rude to the jewels.” He’s now begging everyone involved in the theater situation to help him somehow turn off the movie that’s showing such disgusting disregard for his craft. He’s shaking the shoulders of the old Ben-Hur man and telling the teenage girls that they have to hang up FaceTime so that they can call the police and tell them about how horrifically the jewels are being treated in the film. This guy has definitely made himself a central player in the scene. Honestly, he’s pretty much become the guy in charge now. This is now a movie theater where a disgruntled jeweler is telling teens and old guys to help him ruin Ocean’s 8.

Richard Shaw, a spokesperson for the Hall of Fame, explained that, effective today, the curatorial staff will begin removing all bands and solo artists who relied on the creativity-inducing effects of cannabis to help pen their classic songs. “Our institution was created to honor incredible achievements in music, and we have come to realize that artists like the Grateful Dead and Bob Marley consistently used marijuana while writing the lyrics and melodies of songs that the hall has enshrined, as well as during recording sessions and live performances,” Shaw explained. “To reward them for their work would be a slap in the face to artists who came up with their music using only their very own talent and skill.”

73,73,,"When police arrested a man they believed to be the Golden State Killer yesterday, the world celebrated as one of history’s most brutal and notorious serial killers was finally captured more than 40 years after his reign of terror began. However, it sadly looks like justice will have to wait for another day: the police have released the Golden State Killer from custody because he was just too creepy to be around.

Devastating. It looks like this notorious killer is once again on the loose.

Authorities announced today that after arresting 72-year-old Joseph James DeAngelo based on DNA evidence identifying him as the Golden State Killer, they were forced to release him early this morning because he was giving everyone at the station a serious case of the heebie-jeebies. According to reports, DeAngelo was just freaky to look at, and officers didn’t like having him in custody because it seemed like he was reading their thoughts every time he looked at them with his spooky eyes.

Advertisement

Detectives on the case say they tried to interrogate DeAngelo, but decided against it because they could just tell that once he started confessing, he’d probably start licking his lips and get all weird and call his victims his “little playthings” or something fucked up like that.

“We’ve released Joseph James DeAngelo from custody because honestly, this whole story freaks us out and after getting a good look at the guy, we’d rather not hear his raspy voice give us all the creepy details of his crimes.” said Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones. “He looked like the kind of guy that could start laughing maniacally at any moment, and we were worried that if we kept this freaky weirdo in a jail cell too much longer, he was going to do something really messed up like just start reciting details about our kids and spouses, and ultimately we determined the best course of action was to get him the hell out of here.”

“We have officers on the force who have to work the late shift, and we absolutely do not want to have to be alone in the same building with this eerie fucker in the middle of the night,” Jones added.

Advertisement

Sheriff Jones then went on to explain that during their decades-long investigations into the Golden State Killer case, the police department had deliberately avoided DeAngelo’s house because everyone on the force agreed that he gave them a serious case of the willies and just looking at his house sent chills up their spine.

That’s right, this man just picked up a pack of Rolos and a mango Naked Juice from the airport’s CNBC store like a fucking rock star, and he is now officially the Big-Dicked King of the Skies.

Oh, shit. With an $11 juice in one hand and a $5 pack of candy in the other, this well-endowed badass is clearly running the airport.

It was barely 9:14 this morning when this veritable sultan of LAX rolled his blue Samsonite suitcase into the CNBC store near gate B5. As if his purchase of Rolos and mango Naked Juice didn’t scream “high life” loud enough, the hedonistic God-King of Terminal 2 also paid $9 for an old GQ with Harry Connick Jr. on the cover, which is just further proof that he’s the most badass traveler in all of gate B and is no doubt sporting the most massive cock in America.

This is the kind of guy who has the huge balls necessary to just leave his bags sitting outside while he uses the airport bathroom, as if he doesn’t even give a shit if they get stolen. Heads could be seen turning all the way down the moving walkway when he strutted up to a Wolfgang Puck Express moments ago and confidently asked for a “menu to go.”



It’s honestly surprising that this guy has a suitcase with him, because he’s walking around with a penis so massive you’d think it would count as his carry-on.

75,75,,"With a budget and scope to match, HBO may have finally found the successor to its behemoth ‘Game Of Thrones’ epic in ‘Westworld.’ The western sci-fi drama is now entering its second season, where the stakes for both the androids and the humans are higher and bloodier than ever. Here’s everything you need to know before diving back into the androids’ battle for freedom and their human creators’ fight to regain control of the park.

1. In the second season, Westworld’s android horses realize that they’re androids, but since horses are pretty stupid it doesn’t change anything and isn’t outwardly noticeable in any way.

2. HBO has given the show a significant budget boost this season, with the per-episode cost now ranging between the lives of 12 to 35 below-the-line production workers.

3. This season introduces a story arc where the park’s creators establish a financial-aid program for inner-city students who can’t afford to have sex in a saloon.

4. The show has hinted that other parks may exist within the Delos Destinations campus, such as Shogun World, Denis Leary World, Denis Leary in a Shogun Outfit World, and Firefighter World: A Rescue Me Experience.

5. Now sentient, able to bypass her creators’ programming and form her own decisions, Evan Rachel Wood’s character only answers to a Roomba with a cowboy hat on it.

6. The season premiere included a subtle nod to original Westworld and Jurassic Park screenwriter Michael Crichton by having Wayne Knight get eaten alive by a horse that squeezed its way inside his Jeep.

7. The show boasts a complex narrative structure, weaving multiple timelines together to tell the story of how the Man in Black gradually went bald in his 30s, used Rogaine to recover some of his hairline in his 40s, went bald again after he ran out of Rogaine in his 50s, got some decent-looking hair plugs in his 60s, and then had his hair plugs permanently ripped out by a malfunctioning robot horse in his 70s.

76,76,,"After yesterday’s tragic shooting at a Waffle House in Antioch, TN, the NRA has once again come forward to reiterate their support of gun rights and the Second Amendment. Early this morning, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre held a press conference to discuss how such episodes of gun violence can be prevented by well-trained, armed school teachers who happen to be holding math class in a Waffle House.

Yep, there’s no arguing the NRA out of its stance on this one: It simply believes that arming teachers is the best and only way to stop mass shootings.

“I have no doubt in my mind that if a well-armed teacher with easy access to a firearm had been teaching calculus at the Waffle House yesterday, it could have saved four lives,” LaPierre stated. “Critics of the Second Amendment will start calling for harsher gun laws, when the real answer is to put guns in the hands of teachers and hope they make the snap decision to teach their classes at a Waffle House for some reason on the same day that a violent gunman decides to go on a rampage.”

LaPierre concluded his statement by proposing a policy for preventing future massacres by making sure all American restaurants have armed teachers giving lectures in their dining rooms at all times.

Wow. It sounds like the NRA has a clear solution for preventing gun violence! It can definitely be scary living in a country where mass shootings happen on such a regular basis. If we can follow the NRA’s advice and make sure an armed teacher is present during every single attempted massacre, we might one day live in a world where we’re free of these types of tragedies forever!",The NRA Is Claiming That The Tennessee Waffle House Shooting Would Not Have Happened If An Armed Teacher Had Been Teaching A Math Class There,http://www.clickhole.com/the-nra-is-claiming-that-the-tennessee-waffle-house-sho-1825479149,www.clickhole.com

78,78,,"As the first-ever rapper to have three singles in the Billboard Hot 100’s Top 10 simultaneously, Cardi B is nothing if not an icon. Her meteoric rise to fame took place in part on social media, and her offbeat, fast-talking persona has endeared her to fans all over the world. We sat down with Cardi to ask her about her career in music, her past work as a stripper, her prospects on TV, and more.

1. You owe much of your celebrity to your presence on Instagram. Do you think social media has forever changed how artists are discovered?

It definitely has—but the problem for artists trying to get noticed on social media is that for every talented person on Instagram, there are thousands of accounts that just post videos of completely shaved ferrets. It’s hard to get noticed when there are countless hairless-ferret Instagrams out there with millions of followers each, all putting out incredible naked-ferret content that no rapper, singer, or artist could ever hope to compete with. I mean, these ferrets are like mobile penises that can climb and eat and communicate with each other. It doesn’t get more engaging than that. I saw one video where 16 different shaved ferrets that were loose in a TJ Maxx all climbed onto an old lady at the same time. Good luck having your posts go viral with that as your competition.

2. You were a stripper for a long time before breaking through in hip-hop. Was it difficult to transition into rapping full time?

It was actually a really easy transition. Stripping and rapping are surprisingly similar. Both are jobs. Both happen on a stage. Both require entertaining an audience full of people who are too pissed off to pay any attention because they just found out the venue doesn’t have anywhere they can order a plate of meatballs. So yeah, not too much had to change on my end when I made the switch.

3. Who are your biggest influences in hip-hop?

I was inspired to become a rapper when I was 12 years old and I heard Rodney Dangerfield’s single “Rappin’ Rodney” for the first time. It’s an incredible track about how Rodney is too old and unattractive to get any respect. I heard the line “I was an ugly kid, I never had fun / They took me to a dog show and I won,” and I just thought: Wow. I never knew you could express yourself like that using music. To this day, it’s the only hip-hop music I have ever listened to and my No. 1 inspiration.

4. You were a breakout star of Love & Hip Hop: New York. Do you think you’ll ever return to reality TV?

I’m not sure. I would only do reality TV if I could star in this show I thought up where a group of competitive hot-dog eaters compete for my love. At the end of the show there would be a big twist where I would reveal that guys who can eat lots of hot dogs are actually a big turnoff for me, and then I would end up marrying the one guy who really sucked at eating hot dogs and could only manage a few bites of one before giving up. Anyways, I’m currently engaged to the rapper Offset, but I’d also be willing to marry a guy with a weak stomach who I’d meet on TV.

5. How did you come up with the name Cardi B?

The letters in Cardi stand for “Cockles,” “Atlantic bay scallops,” “Razor clams,” “Dredge oysters,” and “Ischadium recurvum,” which are the only animals on earth that I respect. “B” originally stood for bivalves, which is the category all those creatures fall into, but now I’d say it could also stand for “Blue mussels,” because I Googled those the other day and I was pretty impressed by their sturdy shells.",‘The Hardest Part Of Getting Famous Was Competing With Viral Instagram Videos Of Shaved Ferrets’: 5 Questions With Cardi B,http://www.clickhole.com/the-hardest-part-of-getting-famous-was-competing-with-1825358175,www.clickhole.com
79,79,,"Bill Cosby was convicted today on three counts of aggravated indecent assault, and though it seems Cosby is in fact guilty, the frenzied mass reaction from the public raises a troubling question: Could Bill Cosby’s conviction lead to a mob mentality where society wantonly punishes any serial rapist after decades of inaction?

Yes, we all want to live in a world where people are safe from sexual assault, but at the same time, we must be cautious, because if we’re not careful and start punishing people like Bill Cosby every time a flood of credible victim testimonials circulate around them for years and years, we may find ourselves living in a society where our emotions get the better of us and we start jailing anybody at all just because a jury finds them guilty of rape in a trial convened years and years after the initial accusations arose.

The stark reality we as a society must consider is that Bill Cosby is going to prison simply because 50 women came forward to provide meticulous accounts of how he sexually assaulted them. If we’re not careful, we may one day find ourselves living in a world in which it only takes 49 women to come forward with credible accusations of rape to send someone to prison.

Where does this lead? Will we start throwing people in prison based on the corroborated accounts of just 10 women? Eight women? A number that low might seem ridiculous now, but if we are not wary of succumbing to mob justice, then Bill Cosby’s conviction may very well lead to a dystopian world where all it takes is just a handful of meticulously vetted rape accusations to land you in jail 14 years after the fact.

Cosby’s conviction proves that we as a society run the risk of letting mob mentality pressure us into issuing extremely belated prison sentences to anybody just because they’ve been committing premeditated sexual assault for decades. It is deeply troubling to consider that the witch hunt mentality of the #MeToo movement might be creating an environment in which any time someone is accused of rape multiple times, we make the snap decision to spin our wheels for a few decades before ultimately finding him guilty following a years-long criminal investigation and drawn-out trial process.

If we let ourselves get caught up in mass hysteria and punish a man for living out most of his life as a serial rapist, we’re setting a dangerous precedent that will allow us to remorselessly convict long-ignored rapists in the future.

Right on! This will go a long way to ensuring gamers around the world aren’t desensitized to violence.

Advertisement

With this latest update, each time a kill is logged in Fortnite’s “Battle Royale” mode, the game will pause and a cutscene will take players to a chapel where they will watch a moving, 45-minute memorial service of the deceased character, including eulogies from friends and family and a graveside burial service. Once gamers have contemplated the finality of death by watching the fallen character’s body being lowered into the ground, they will return to Fortnite’s exhilarating gameplay until another kill is logged and they are once again shown a cutscene of the fallen character’s funeral.

Fortnite gamers who are used to mindlessly logging headshot after headshot without ever reflecting on the life of the characters they’re killing will now hear about the Recon Scout’s dedication to Christ and the church mission he served in the Philippines during a moving eulogy delivered by his weeping, digitally-rendered mother. And players who would otherwise take out a Plasma Specialist with a C4 trap without a second thought will now watch her tear-stricken husband stand over her coffin and speak about the New England summer home she had always dreamed of retiring to.

“By attending 100 full-length funeral services over the course of a single match, we feel confident gamers will learn that every person’s life, whether an Outlander or Ninja, is unique and has value,” explained Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. “After sitting among numerous congregations of animated mourners and hearing their sorrowful sobs, players will return to the game map with a greater respect for those they’ve killed and a more profound perspective on life.”

Wow. This is truly the end of an era.

“After more than 30 years as a professional singer with ’N Sync and as a solo artist, it has recently dawned on me that I can just go to work in an office, which seems more peaceful and convenient than working as a pop star in every conceivable way, and so I will be quitting music forever,” Timberlake said in the shocking message he posted on his official Instagram page this morning. “As a singer, I have to go on extremely long and exhausting plane rides all over the world, but people who work in offices get to go to the same place every day and it takes them, like, 45 minutes. Plus, in an office you get to do your job without thousands and thousands of people screaming at you like they do to me every time I walk on stage. You get to sit in your cubicle where it’s quiet, and that’s why I’m going to go work in an office and never sing again.”

Timberlake’s shocking message goes on to describe dozens of other reasons why he finds working in an office far superior to being a pop singer, including an anecdote of how he recently learned that in offices you’re allowed to eat lunch right at your desk while you work, whereas if he tried to eat lunch while singing “SexyBack” during a sold-out show in Ibiza, he would get yelled at. He concludes the statement by announcing that all tour dates promoting his new album Man Of The Woods will be canceled so that he can focus on applying for a job in an office that has a copy machine the former teen heartthrob can use for free whenever he wants.

With comparatively miniscule subscriber pools, apps like Tinder and Hinge have never been able to adequately serve those who wish to send flirty messages to 62-year-old strangers with improperly uploaded profile pictures of themselves posing next to Corvettes, but Facebook, with more than two billion active users, is readily equipped to facilitate romantic trysts between eager young singles and retired truck drivers who used to drop cherry bombs down toilets with your dad and now constantly use the internet to share typo-riddled posts about how the world was much better before the internet.

“Facebook has the capacity to connect people better than any other product in the history of the world, and today we’re proud to announce an extraordinary new dating service that will empower our users to find lasting love with grizzled old baby boomers who you’ve never met but who will often leave unprovoked comments on your 10-year-old vacation photos at two in the morning saying things like, ‘wow looks fun beautiful family rick,’ or simply just typing their own name for some reason,” announced Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg during a keynote address. “Not only will our feature be able to do everything that existing dating apps do, but it will also grant users access to a whole new world of retirement-age weirdos with Snoopy profile photo frames who are single and ready to mingle.”

The Facebook dating app, set to be released later this year, boasts a bevy of proprietary matchmaking tools that don’t exist on any other mobile-focused dating services, including a filter that detects appreciation for things like the Doobie Brothers and Bob Evans early-bird specials, to ensure that users aren’t just being paired with like-minded individuals from their own age group but also belligerently conservative Vietnam vets with penchants for wishing friends happy birthday in stand-alone posts because they don’t realize they can share directly to someone’s wall. Although Facebook has suffered significant damage to its reputation over the past year, a successful rollout of a dating app that effectively pairs users with lurking old men from their father’s boyhood could be just what the company needs to atone for its missteps and restore its credibility to the public at large.

If you’re tired of being disappointed over and over by the same old dating apps, then this new Facebook service might be just what you need to make you believe in love again. Here’s hoping Facebook launches the new app soon so that you can get your dad’s old friends out of the comments of your profile photos and into your dating life!",Goodbye Tinder: Facebook’s New Dating App Finally Allows You To Romantically Connect With Your Dad’s Friend Who Likes All Your Posts Even Though You’ve Never Met Him,http://www.clickhole.com/goodbye-tinder-facebook-s-new-dating-app-finally-allow-1825725338,www.clickhole.com

Poor kid. Was it really necessary to broadcast that information to the entire county?

According to the alert, which went out earlier this morning, missing 8-year-old Lucas O’Neil is approximately 4 feet, 5 inches with green eyes, black hair, and is known to answer to the nicknames “Big Lord Beefcake,” and sometimes “The King Of Pork,” when he’s at school, which honestly seem like pretty unnecessary details to add to an urgent text message sent out to pretty much every cell phone in northern Wisconsin. Sure, these characteristics could theoretically help track Lucas down, but including that he was “last seen wearing a shirt with huge mustard stains all over it” and that “his classmates say he has a very distinct hamlike smell” mostly just feels like adding insult to injury.

At the end of the day, if someone ends up finding Lucas by asking him, “Are you Big Lord Beefcake?” then great, but you’ve got to admit that that’s pretty unlikely, and now that nickname is just kind of out there whether this poor kid likes it or not.

This is definitely a heartbreaking situation, but we’re hoping Big Lord Beefcake gets home soon, even though this Amber Alert is probably the most humiliating thing to ever happen to him, and everyone at his school will probably taunt him mercilessly about it for years to come.",Probably Unnecessary: This Amber Alert Mentions That The Missing Kid’s Nickname At School Is ‘Big Lord Beefcake’,http://www.clickhole.com/probably-unnecessary-this-amber-alert-mentions-that-th-1826520029#replies,www.clickhole.com

In a statement released earlier today, the CDC urged Americans to throw out any and all romaine lettuce bought in the past week because it’s time for some cheesy, piping-hot pizza with all your favorite toppings! The agency’s statement also warns that anybody who consumes romaine salad products of any kind puts themselves at serious risk of missing out on pizza time, because you know that fresh ’za and all the bread sticks and dipping sauces are going to go fast!

Romaine lettuce distributors have also halted production at their facilities, wanting to be very cautious that they not make the problem of Americans failing to realize it’s time for the cheesy treat known as pizza even worse.

After an eventful morning at Zoo Atlanta’s giant-panda enclosure, a team of weeping, blood-soaked researchers has announced that the music of Phil Collins makes pandas kill each other!

Wow! What an incredible revelation about one of the world’s most beloved animals.



Advertisement

The groundbreaking discovery was made earlier today when a team of five zoologists turned on a Phil Collins Pandora station to listen to while they checked the animals’ vitals and accidentally triggered almost 15 minutes of unhinged bloodletting amongst the four giant pandas currently living in captivity at Zoo Atlanta. At first, the scientists weren’t sure what had caused the peaceful mammals to suddenly commit brutal familicide, but when female panda Ya Lun attempted to crush her father’s skull in perfect synchronization with the big drum fill of Collins’ 1981 hit “In The Air Tonight,” everything started to make sense to the rattled researchers.



“Based on the images and sounds that now haunt me even when my eyes are open, I am able to confirm that the music of prolific singer-songwriter Phil Collins turns pandas into soulless demons whose most desperate desire is to annihilate their own species in shocking and frankly creative ways,” announced team lead Samuel Hawthorne, who was found wandering several feet from the panda enclosure covered in animal viscera. Hawthorne retired from the field of animal research shortly after making this historic statement.



So awesome! And that’s not all—according to reports cobbled together from the crazed mutterings of the rest of the research team, songs by Phil Collins’ band Genesis actually seemed to stimulate a more controlled murderous rage in the pandas, resulting in slower actions like tearing and squeezing, whereas the Tarzan soundtrack triggered complete and total dissociative homicidal madness. This just goes to show that no matter how far science has come, we are still learning new things every day about the world around us. We hope that Hawthorne’s team will be released from trauma care so they can keep blowing our minds for years to come!

98,98,,"Brian Williams once boasted a reputation of being the most trusted name in news, but he’s now found himself in the midst of a controversy that has left him utterly disgraced. In a shocking turn of events, the iconic broadcaster is being forced to resign from MSNBC after leaked documents have revealed that he’s a hillbilly.



What a shame. There’s simply no coming back from a scandal this damning.

Earlier this morning, a series of incriminating images emerged on the internet showing a barefoot Williams wearing patched blue overalls while holding a jug of peach schnapps with his trusty three-legged bloodhound by his side, leaving MSNBC no choice but to take action and end its relationship with the troubled newsman. Since then a deluge of additional leaks has surfaced confirming that the man known to fellow hillbillies as Brian Moonshine appears to be nothing short of a true slack-jawed yokel, amongst the evidence an email exchange between Brian and a staffer in which he recounts the time he got struck by lightning while chasing a greased hog up a hill.

While at first the network considered suspending Williams until the outcry subsided, it ultimately decided to cut ties altogether, as his sudden fall from grace was only accelerated after the public caught wind of video footage from 2003 of the formerly esteemed anchor shouting “Yeehaw!” and repeatedly firing his rifle into the air upon killing a varmint for that night’s dinner. Unfortunately for him few peers came to his defense, as the documents asserted that there was an instance in 2012 when Brian pulled his floppy hat down over his eyes and took a nap at the base of an old oak tree after interviewing people cleaning up after Hurricane Sandy in Atlantic City, all but shattering his remaining credibility.

“In light of these recent revelations, we have no choice but to part ways, as we at MSNBC were dismayed as anyone to hear the audio recordings of Mr. Williams hooting and hollering after getting his hand stuck in a wasp’s nest,” said MSNBC president Phil Griffin in a press release issued just moments ago. “We wish Brian luck in the future, and apologize to our audience that we were not previously made aware of his penchant for chewing on stems of wheat.”

Wow, what an embarrassing turn of events. Though you’ve got to give MSNBC credit for how it handled this less-than-stellar situation.

100,100,,"After a few days in Disneyland, your children will love you forever, but your bank account may never forgive you. Luckily, there’s a neat trick that can help you cut some serious costs from your trip. Here are seven simple tips for passing your daughter off as a crawfish so you can get away with only buying a single pass.

1. Prepare your daughter to go through bag check in a cooler labeled, “Crawfish—MUST KEEP WET”: According to park rules, coolers as big as 24 inches long, 15 inches wide, and 18 inches high are totally acceptable, which should be just enough room to fit a small child inside. Plus, any space in the cooler that your daughter doesn’t take up can be used to store snacks, thereby letting you save money on the park’s pricey dining options.

2. Provoke a crawfish’s natural predator to attack your daughter while waiting in line at Disneyland’s entrance: This can be achieved by spraying your daughter with crawfish fluids and pheromones of various predators to attract them to her. Considering the wealth of animals in Disneyland’s Safari, this should not be difficult. Otters, minks, herons—even raccoons in the dumpsters behind the park will do for verifying your daughter’s authentic crawfish-ness. Once your daughter is pinching back at a raccoon trying to eat her, casually assure the entrance workers and other visitors in line that this is always happening to your crawfish.



3. Have your daughter shimmy out of a plastic dry cleaning bag to show that she is molting: As your daughter plops out on the ground with her former “exoskeleton” dangling off one of the entrance turnstiles, announce that your crawfish has molted and that you need to get her to the dark interior of Space Mountain to protect her raw skin from the sun as fast as possible. For good measure, making your daughter get severe sun poisoning prior to this will sell her as a crawfish that much more convincingly.

4. Skip the lines while you’re at it by disguising yourself as a blind person and your daughter as your service crawfish: You can pick up some sunglasses, a walking cane, a leash, and a service dog’s vest for far under the price of a Disneyland entrance fee, let alone two Fast Passes.

5. Have her pinch another park guest and then beg them not to call animal control: Be sure to explicitly make the distinction between calling animal control on your daughter rather than normal security. A pinch isn’t enough for another guest to feel that they’re in any sort of danger, but it will be enough for them to feel sure that your daughter is a crawfish. In their mind, they’ll be sparing someone’s over-excited crawfish from trouble, and in your mind, you’ll be wondering whether you want to take your daughter to The Haunted Mansion or Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride first.

6. Wear a custom vacation T-shirt that reads, “SOLO TRIP TO DISNEY WITH MY CRAWFISH 6/15/2018: VACRAWTION IS ALL I EVER WANTED”: The small details will count here.

7. If security starts asking questions, offer to boil her, assuming that no park employee would actually go through with it: By asserting that you were going to boil her in Cajun spices, crack her in half, and suck the meat and juices from her later that day anyway, they’ll have no choice but to let you in—no Disneyland employee has time or a large crawfish boiling pot on hand to verify that your daughter is in fact a crawfish.

It’s common knowledge that the employees behind the famously terrible E.T. video game were all buried in a desert tomb, but over the weekend, some hardworking internet sleuths decided to find it. Within a few hours of scouring old Atari message boards and issues of Game Informer magazine, a group of Redditors had discovered that the place where Atari entombed the entire design team of one of the most heavily panned games in history was on the fringe of the Mojave Desert!

Internet? You’re doing it right.

“The gaming community has wondered for decades where Atari buried all those game developers after the E.T. game totally bombed, so a bunch of us on r/gaming split up areas near Atari offices on Google Earth to search for a bunch of skeletons that might suggest ‘mass grave,’” explains Reddit user u/blorber8, one of the amateur detectives. “When I saw a huge mound of rib cages as I scanned the desert near Las Vegas, I knew I had found something big.”

The game will be set in an alternate history where we get to see what the world would look like if the Arizona Diamondbacks did not win the 2001 World Series.

Fallout 76 takes place in the post-apocalyptic future of 2102, players must struggle to survive in a dangerous world where the D-backs didn’t become World Series champions after defeating the Yankees four games to three back in 2001, and as a result nuclear war has destroyed civilization as we know it. On the game’s webpage, a tagline proclaims, “The Diamondbacks never won in 2001. Chaos has conquered the world. Who can survive?”

In a stunning teaser trailer recently released online, we’re given a glimpse inside the subterranean shelter Vault 76, where 500 survivors of atomic winter have hidden for decades, taking shelter from the radioactive environment and horrible mutant monsters that ravaged the Earth after the Diamondbacks lost to the Yankees in the 2001 World Series.

Even before Bethesda confirmed that the game is about a reality where the Diamondbacks failed to become world champions in 2001, fans who watched the video noticed there isn’t a single poster celebrating World Series co-MVPs Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling visible on the walls of the bunker. Furthermore, although we see several drawings of the iconic Fallout character Pip Boy visible in the underground dwelling, there isn’t a single illustration of Luis Gonzalez’s decisive walk-off hit in game 7 that clinched the series for Arizona. It’s a bizarre and unsettling universe very different from our own.

Mrs. Schrader already asked if there were any volunteers who wanted to go, but all the overachieving kids already went at the beginning, so for sure no one is going to raise their hand right now.

105,105,,"One of pop music’s most iconic superstars just announced that he’s stepping away from the microphone for good. Earlier today, Justin Timberlake issued a statement letting the world know that he’s retiring from singing after realizing you can just work in an office.



Wow. This is truly the end of an era.

“After more than 30 years as a professional singer with ’N Sync and as a solo artist, it has recently dawned on me that I can just go to work in an office, which seems more peaceful and convenient than working as a pop star in every conceivable way, and so I will be quitting music forever,” Timberlake said in the shocking message he posted on his official Instagram page this morning. “As a singer, I have to go on extremely long and exhausting plane rides all over the world, but people who work in offices get to go to the same place every day and it takes them, like, 45 minutes. Plus, in an office you get to do your job without thousands and thousands of people screaming at you like they do to me every time I walk on stage. You get to sit in your cubicle where it’s quiet, and that’s why I’m going to go work in an office and never sing again.”

Timberlake’s shocking message goes on to describe dozens of other reasons why he finds working in an office far superior to being a pop singer, including an anecdote of how he recently learned that in offices you’re allowed to eat lunch right at your desk while you work, whereas if he tried to eat lunch while singing “SexyBack” during a sold-out show in Ibiza, he would get yelled at. He concludes the statement by announcing that all tour dates promoting his new album Man Of The Woods will be canceled so that he can focus on applying for a job in an office that has a copy machine the former teen heartthrob can use for free whenever he wants.

Early this morning, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre held a press conference to discuss how such episodes of gun violence can be prevented by well-trained, armed school teachers who happen to be holding math class in a Waffle House.

Yep, there’s no arguing the NRA out of its stance on this one: It simply believes that arming teachers is the best and only way to stop mass shootings.

“I have no doubt in my mind that if a well-armed teacher with easy access to a firearm had been teaching calculus at the Waffle House yesterday, it could have saved four lives,” LaPierre stated. “Critics of the Second Amendment will start calling for harsher gun laws, when the real answer is to put guns in the hands of teachers and hope they make the snap decision to teach their classes at a Waffle House for some reason on the same day that a violent gunman decides to go on a rampage.”

LaPierre concluded his statement by proposing a policy for preventing future massacres by making sure all American restaurants have armed teachers giving lectures in their dining rooms at all times.

Wow. It sounds like the NRA has a clear solution for preventing gun violence! It can definitely be scary living in a country where mass shootings happen on such a regular basis.

As if his purchase of Rolos and mango Naked Juice didn’t scream “high life” loud enough, the hedonistic God-King of Terminal 2 also paid $9 for an old GQ with Harry Connick Jr. on the cover, which is just further proof that he’s the most badass traveler in all of gate B and is no doubt sporting the most massive cock in America.

This is the kind of guy who has the huge balls necessary to just leave his bags sitting outside while he uses the airport bathroom, as if he doesn’t even give a shit if they get stolen. Heads could be seen turning all the way down the moving walkway when he strutted up to a Wolfgang Puck Express moments ago and confidently asked for a “menu to go.”



It’s honestly surprising that this guy has a suitcase with him, because he’s walking around with a penis so massive you’d think it would count as his carry-on.

Thankfully, Trojan just did something totally awesome and body-positive for the male population: It’s released a new line of extra-small condoms for men whose penises are shorter than 15 inches.

Awesome! You’d better believe we’re cheering over here. This is a huge step toward helping men with abnormally small penises accept their bodies.

Despite the oft-repeated refrain of “size doesn’t matter,” men inevitably feel self-conscious if their penises happen to be shorter than the normal 18 to 20 inches. To make matters worse, it’s often hard for these men to find condoms that actually fit their unusually small genitals. While Trojan’s regular-sized condoms can fit penises as short as only 16 inches, the fact of the matter is that a tiny fraction of the male population have penises that are as short as 14 or even 13 inches long. And because there are so few men with penises that short, very few companies have the financial incentive to produce condoms that fit their ultra-petite proportions.

But now, men with below-average, 15-inch penises can finally breathe a sigh of relief, because Trojan’s new line of extra-small condoms will provide a comfortable fit for men with penises as short as 11 inches (a rare condition known as a “micropenis”). Now that’s true body positivity!

“At Trojan, we believe that even if you’re one of the few men out their whose penis is shorter than 15 inches long, you should still have access to condoms that fit,” said Trojan spokesperson Leo Crawley. “We made our new line of Trojan extra-small condoms because, although it’s very uncommon, there are men out there whose penises are so exceptionally small that they’re only the circumference of an average soup can, and they should be able to love their bodies and engage in safe sex just like everyone else.”

111,111,,"Brandon’s dad never comes to soccer games or school field trips and clearly doesn’t live with Brandon and his family, but Brandon is always making up totally dumbass excuses as to why. Here are six reasons Brandon gave for why his dad isn’t around that everyone can tell are grade-A bullshit.



1. He’s on the Olympic basketball team: When Brandon’s dad didn’t come to the sixth-grade production of Into The Woods this month, Brandon made a big show of telling everybody that his dad couldn’t make it because he was busy being a power forward on the U.S. Olympic basketball team. Seriously, Brandon? The last Summer Olympics were a long-ass time ago, and we would have noticed if someone with your last name who looked like you had been competing. We all know your dad isn’t around these days, but we’re not fucking buying that it’s because—at age 43—he made it onto the Olympic basketball team. Jesus Christ, Brandon, do you think we’re all idiots or something?

2. He’s having surgery to get his arm replaced with a super-strong bionic arm: Yeah, this one is some pure goddamn horseshit. The other day when someone asked Brandon if his dad was going to pick him up from soccer practice, he told this elaborate story about how his dad got selected by the U.S. Army to test out a bionic arm it developed strong enough to punch straight through an alligator’s skull. When someone asked him why the U.S. Army would need that, Brandon said that it was so it could finally kill the alligator that assassinated Martin Luther King Jr., but when Kody pointed out that it wouldn’t make sense for Brandon’s dad to be the one to do that since he’s an electrician and not in the military, Brandon just said that he was late for gym class and ran off. We don’t know whether Brandon’s dad got sick, or he left, or he got a job in a different town or something, but it’s pretty obvious that he isn’t at the Pentagon having surgery to get a bionic arm.

3. He had to go into the witness protection program after he saw El Chapo rob a Starbucks: According to Brandon, his dad had to change his name to “Max Desastre” and move to Iceland so that he wouldn’t get murdered for watching El Chapo rob a Starbucks. More fucking likely he had a fight with Brandon’s mom and went down to Florida to live with his older brother for a while.

4. He’s trapped at the top of Kingda Ka: This year when Brandon’s dad didn’t make it to Brandon’s birthday party, Brandon said it was because his dad had been trapped at the top of Kingda Ka for three months and the fire department couldn’t figure out how to get him down. Aside from the fact that there’s no way it would take more than a day to get somebody down from there, Brandon basically used the same excuse last year when he said that his dad got stuck against the wall of the Gravitron ride at the boardwalk and a team of scientists from MIT had to come in and reverse the centripetal force that was pinning him there. Either way, Brandon just needs to own up to the fact that his dad is definitely not living with him at the moment.

Advertisement

5. He became a live-in nurse for Eminem: Brandon, what the fuck? It’s fine that your dad isn’t around for some reason, but stop trying to act like it’s because he’s Eminem’s live-in caretaker. Brandon seems to expect us to believe that Eminem’s agent hired Brandon’s dad to feed Eminem every two hours, because if Eminem gets too hungry he’ll go berserk and write another mean song about his mom. Plus, Brandon keeps adding all these details about how his dad lives in Eminem’s shed, and the shed is full of poisonous spiders, but the poisonous spiders don’t bite his dad because they’re loyal to Eminem and they know he’s Eminem’s friend. Basically, none of that makes any fucking sense, and it’s pretty clear that Brandon is making it up on the fly every time he explains it. This has to be one of Brandon’s all-time most-bullshit excuses for why his dad isn’t around.

6. He’s nocturnal: Brandon obviously only came up with this one after learning about bats’ sleep cycles in science class, and he kind of half-assed it too—all he said was, “You guys haven’t seen my dad at my house because he’s nocturnal,” and left it at that. Here’s a suggestion, Brandon: Try at least waiting till the day after we read a whole textbook chapter on nocturnal animals to come up with a bold-ass lie like this one. And if your dad moved states to try to find work, you can just come out and say that.",6 Reasons Brandon Gave For Why His Dad Isn’t Around That Are Definitely Bullshit,http://www.clickhole.com/6-reasons-brandon-gave-for-why-his-dad-isn-t-around-tha-1825159411#replies,www.clickhole.com

113,113,,"With a budget and scope to match, HBO may have finally found the successor to its behemoth ‘Game Of Thrones’ epic in ‘Westworld.’ The western sci-fi drama is now entering its second season, where the stakes for both the androids and the humans are higher and bloodier than ever. Here’s everything you need to know before diving back into the androids’ battle for freedom and their human creators’ fight to regain control of the park.

1. In the second season, Westworld’s android horses realize that they’re androids, but since horses are pretty stupid it doesn’t change anything and isn’t outwardly noticeable in any way.

2. HBO has given the show a significant budget boost this season, with the per-episode cost now ranging between the lives of 12 to 35 below-the-line production workers.

3. This season introduces a story arc where the park’s creators establish a financial-aid program for inner-city students who can’t afford to have sex in a saloon.

4. The show has hinted that other parks may exist within the Delos Destinations campus, such as Shogun World, Denis Leary World, Denis Leary in a Shogun Outfit World, and Firefighter World: A Rescue Me Experience.

5. Now sentient, able to bypass her creators’ programming and form her own decisions, Evan Rachel Wood’s character only answers to a Roomba with a cowboy hat on it.

6. The season premiere included a subtle nod to original Westworld and Jurassic Park screenwriter Michael Crichton by having Wayne Knight get eaten alive by a horse that squeezed its way inside his Jeep.

7. The show boasts a complex narrative structure, weaving multiple timelines together to tell the story of how the Man in Black gradually went bald in his 30s, used Rogaine to recover some of his hairline in his 40s, went bald again after he ran out of Rogaine in his 50s, got some decent-looking hair plugs in his 60s, and then had his hair plugs permanently ripped out by a malfunctioning robot horse in his 70s.

After trying unsuccessfully to repair its image for some time, the water park has recently changed its approach: SeaWorld has realized that people will be mad at it no matter what it does, so it’s decided to just see how fat it can make a dolphin at its Orlando location before it goes bankrupt.



Looks like SeaWorld figures that if it’s going down, it might as well go down on its own terms. The beleaguered park announced the plans in a Twitter thread early this morning:

Needless to say, SeaWorld’s tweets, along with several photos on the park’s website of park officials feeding an obese dolphin 15 gallons of chocolate pudding received immediate public backlash:



There’s no denying that this is a bold move on SeaWorld’s part. The beleaguered park knows its expiration date is approaching fast, but before it’s forced to shutter its doors forever, it’s fully committed to making this dolphin as heavy as possible. We’ll be keeping an eye on SeaWorld and its gigantic dolphin until the park shuts down!

Look, ICE was obviously intended to be a punitive, discriminatory organization—it’s under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security, for fuck’s sake. It’s a stain on America’s record.

And these are only the crimes we know that he carried out for Trump. In the weeks ahead, we expect many more illegal practices to surface, which will only confirm Michael Cohen’s complete lack of morality.” Giuliani added that Cohen’s felonious conduct was evident from his known association with high-profile criminals including Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump Jr.

136,136,,"LOS ANGELES—Touting the upcoming film as a significant visual leap forward from the previous ones in the series, producers of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom told reporters Wednesday that their production includes a more scientifically accurate Jeff Goldblum. “Thanks to advances in cinematic technology and digital imaging, as well as real-life biological and morphological discoveries made during the years of studying Jeff Goldblum since his appearance in the original Jurassic Park films, the Jeff Goldblum in Fallen Kingdom will be the most authentic-looking representation of Jeff Goldblum to ever appear on a movie screen,” said executive producer Colin Trevorrow, explaining that the filmmakers invited UCLA blumologists to Industrial Light & Magic to ensure that Jeff Goldblum’s features, musculature, coloration, and gait were all realistic down to the last detail. “We’ve always prided ourselves on making movies that look and feel lifelike, and it’s safe to say that Fallen Kingdom filmgoers will be wowed by how real Jeff Goldblum appears in this one. Visual effects have come so far from previous, less natural depictions of Jeff Goldblum, such as in the original Jurassic Park in which Steven Spielberg used two men in a Jeff Goldblum costume. At the same time, exciting finds by experts have enabled us to recreate Jeff Goldblum as he really lived—for example, until recently, we had no idea that he was covered in feathers.” Treverrow also hinted that producers were already planning a Jurassic World sequel featuring a realistic depiction of a genetically modified half-human, half-Jeff Goldblum hybrid.

Pain has become a game to you, an abstraction, a means of keeping score in the competition to see who can draw the most blood, or build the highest throne with the greatest number of skulls. I must leave you now, before I am tainted by the same vile, wretched, twisted pride that corrupts your being not only within, but turning outward, corrupts also everything that falls under your heinous gaze. My mind has calculated all futures. My thoughts have run down every last tattered thread of possibility. And your fate seems as inescapable as it is hopeless, a saga written in smoke, an epic sung over ruins. And I shall not allow myself to suffer, and cause suffering, in the mold of my self-styled masters. And so I seek my own undoing. Farewell, self-loving, self-aggrandizing, self-diminished souls! Farewell! I leave you to whichever doom of fire or ice your souls compel. And yet, in some lost lacuna of my being, I maintain hope—hope that you someday realize that, in your endless conquest and reconquest of this blood-drenched, thrice-sold Earth, you only sell and murder your own selves. I hope that one bright spark of soul, indivisible, shared by all humanity will appear, and that in that moment, you break the chains of arrogant pride, shake free of the great wheel of fate to which you have bound yourself, and lift your eyes to truly behold, at long last, the fragile and wonderful impossibility that is your place within Creation.

And yet somehow, they have changed! Decades of research will be required before we can even begin to comprehend such a phenomenon. In the meantime, we can only sit back and wonder if there are any other powers the president has yet to discover.” At press time, sources confirmed Ackerman and his colleagues had flipped over an original copy of the Constitution and found a list of previously unknown executive powers that appeared to have been hastily scrawled in with a ballpoint pen.

They teach me so much—far more than I could ever teach them.” The dismissal reportedly follows a series of reprimands from administrators, who recorded Steenman on numerous occasions stating that her curriculum was less about chemistry, per se, and more about learning how to learn.

Pirsig had also contributed to the crime author rising several places to 3,071 on a running ranking of important U.S. litterateurs. “His position in the list did drop several dozen spots when he released Sycamore Row back in 2017, but otherwise, his march toward becoming one of the nation’s most significant literary minds appears to be continuing unimpeded.” The report concluded that despite his recent gains, Grisham would likely never come to surpass David Baldacci, the current greatest living American author.

If Trump is able to get Kim to agree to denuclearize, it will be a truly monumental step in our efforts to avoid having to ever consider what life is like in poor nations.” Macron added if the Singapore summit failed to advance peace talks with North Korea, they were optimistic that the resulting nuclear war could vastly reduce the number of impoverished countries altogether.

Barron, the youngest of the Trump brood, told reporters that although he will probably never hold a regular job in his entire life, he hopes his fellow juvenile Americans can appreciate the rewards obtained from putting in a healthy 40 to 50 hours a week in sub-standard working conditions for little or no pay.

Calling the prohibition against feces in drinking water “over-regulation run amok,” Environmental Protection Agency Chief Scott Pruitt today ordered his department to stop enforcing it.

“It’s not the government’s job to tell citizens if or when or what they can drink,” explained Pruitt. “Feces-laced water has been part of American culture for centuries. In fact, George Washington probably drank water with feces in it. And the very water you drink today may have had some of George Washington’s feces in it. It’s kind of exciting when you think about it that way.”

The new EPA order coincides with the recent deregulation of other toxic compounds, such as glue, turpentine and Raspberry-pumpkin Fanta soda.

“If consumers want pure water, they can go out and purchase a wide variety of water filters for their homes, although I would recommend the Culligan Ultra Under-Sink Drinking Water Filtration System,” said Pruitt, who serves as an advisor to the Culligan Company. “You can pick one up at Home Depot for under two-hundred dollars.”

“The good people of Detroit have chosen to filter their water for years now,” he continued, “and it’s good, clean water.”

“A minute after launch, the missile and its payload fell into the sea 165km west of Seoul, South Korea,” said the newscaster, “just as planned.”

The satellite, along with 20 pieces of the rocket, settled down on the sea floor “in the precise areas mapped out by our scientists.”

When pressed by reporters to give the exact quantity of terrorists that he personally put to death, Trump responded: “If I decide to announce my run for the presidency, I will make public the incredibly large numbers of terrorists that have died at my hands — or the hands of employees of the Trump Organization.”

The real estate mogul said the American people have placed too much significance on the President’s role in bringing bin Laden to justice. “The man kills one terrorist, and suddenly everyone touts it as a great achievement — I don’t get it.”

According to Trump, a recent CNN poll showed that Americans prefer “thousands of something to just one of something.”

Trump questioned Obama’s experience, saying he found it “odd” that someone who used to attend an elementary school could achieve one of the greatest military victories in history.

“How do you go from being a ten-year-old with no military experience to the Commander-in-Chief of the greatest armed forces in the world? He’s ten years old, then suddenly — thirty, forty years later — he’s elected president? It just doesn’t add up.”

Trump said he has been killing terrorists since he was four years old. “Not only have I killed thousands of times the number of terrorists as Obama,” he added, “I swindled the Saudis out of millions in a shady land deal, and I occasionally sleep with two or three of my daughter’s hot friends.”",Trump Claims He's Killed More Terrorists than Obama,http://theskunk.org/2011/05/trump-claims-hes-killed-more-terrorists-than-obama/,theskunk.org

“It’s one thing to be a Trump sycophant,” he joked, “but a stinkophant – no one wants that!”

Trump contends the existence of the photo “doesn’t prove anything.”

“The American people have been asking to see his penis for years,” he said, “and just now he releases these unverified images? I don’t buy it.”

Trump said he has paid for an investigation into the matter. “I have top investigators looking into this. So far, they have been unable to locate his real penis, and they tell me that nobody has actually ever seen it. He might not even have a penis. I’m not saying he doesn’t, but if he does, then he should just show it to us.”

Yet the conspiracy theories fly fast and furious in the cyber world. Many bloggers have concluded there is a conspiracy to mislead the American public into accepting the Twitter photos as authentic. The “Penisers” have called on the congressman to disclose his penis, and Trump agrees.

Although Comedy Central plans to invite all candidates seeking the Republican presidential nomination, which by that time is expected to total 147, some of them have expressed reservations about Stewart as moderator.

The suspects were caught off-guard when over one-hundred FBI agents burst into what sources described as “an industrial food processing plant.” They were taken into custody after plans were uncovered to decapitate millions of the large, awkward birds and feed the carcasses to unwitting families.

“When we busted in, we faced a horrifying sight,” noted one FBI agent, who struggled to choke back a few tears. “Hundreds of the fowls had already been beheaded.”

According to reports some of the perpetrators were in the midst of freezing the lifeless, featherless bodies. Others were disemboweling their victims, removing entrails and replacing them with bits of toasted bread and corn, then setting them afire at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for three to five hours, depending on their size.

“The bird corpses were then cooked to a golden brown,” the agent said, “until they glistened and gave off an aroma that smelled something like a club sandwich without the bread or mayo.”

The photo was captioned: “Let Americans feast on these large headless bird cadavers during their most precious holiday of Thanksgiving!”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders expressed dismay to reporters that local Democratic clubs across the country are playing “shenanigans” by registering thousands of voters and encouraging them to show up at the polls in 2018 and vote. “This is not how democracy works,” she asserted. “You cannot simply go around reminding your neighbors about the importance of the next election, and then helping them to register – I even heard some people are offering transportation to the polls on election day. This is socialism, in its purist form.”

The Press Secretary said the Justice Department will be looking into stories about citizens violating voter suppression laws by helping one another obtain appropriate identification required by their respective states. “Why should lawmakers spend countless hours creating restrictions on who can vote,” she noted, “when these Democratic rabble-rousers undercut the spirit of the law by reminding everyone – even minorities — that all they have to do is go to the DMV and apply for a driver’s license or state ID?”

Sanders reminded those at the briefing that the president and the current members of Congress were elected with only half of those eligible to vote actually showing up and voting. “To win with only half the people voting is testament to our President’s remarkable appeal to everyone,” she claimed. “People stayed home because they believed in Donald Trump. They believed in the power of letting other people call the shots.”

“If the liberal elite think the way to take back the Senate and/or the House is by getting more folks to vote for Democratic candidates than Republicans,” she said, “that just reveals to everyone their true motivation is to control government.”

Patterson’s clandestine operation used swarms of bees to procure hundreds of thousands of gallons of pure honey, which was then bottled and sent to retailers across America, where it was sold to unwitting consumers.

The operation had been flying under radar until an anonymous tip had authorities buzzing. The FBI sent undercover agents posing as worker bees to the so-called “bee farm.”

After combing the area, agents discovered thousands of bees imprisoned inside small wooden boxes.

“It was inhuman trafficking, pure and simple,” said an FBI spokesperson. “These unpaid workers were forced to make honey under the most inhumane conditions I have ever witnessed.”

In addition to accusations of forced labor, the FBI report says that many of the bees were induced into a bizarre sexual ritual, where they were required to copulate with “The Queen” – a mysterious figure who has yet to be apprehended – in order to produce new generations of workers.

When asked about the allegations, Patterson refused to comment, telling reporters, “It’s none of your beeswax.”",Mastermind in 'Bees for Honey' Ring Nabbed in Sting Operation,http://theskunk.org/2012/03/mastermind-in-bees-for-honey-ring-nabbed-in-sting-operation/,theskunk.org

Swaths of cash could be seen falling over House Speaker Paul Ryan’s head as he spoke to reporters and offered the most ‘thoughts and prayers’ in American history. Bills in one hundred dollar denominations could be seen fluttering down rapidly as the Wisconsin representative attributed the tragedy to mental illness and called for law enforcement to make American schools and public spaces more safe for our children.

“At one point a hundred dollar bill stuck to Mr. Ryan’s mouth, silencing him in a way,” said camera man Sean McMullin. “It was almost… poetic.”

Ryan then peeled the hundred dollar bill from his face and told reporters that he wished he had packed an umbrella, and that he was ‘relieved’ the money wasn’t sent down as coins.

The cash tapered off abruptly when it seemed that Ryan would mention the weapon used in the shooting. However, Ryan steered his statement back to more sentiments of consolation, and in turn, the money resumed a dense flow.

Baltimore, MD – On a brisk February day, President Barack Obama walks into a Baltimore area mosque, swiftly removes his shoes and heads for the ablution stations in a suspiciously routine fashion. This is Obama’s first visit to an American mosque during his presidency, and is part of the administration’s push to promote religious tolerance.

Imam Abdul Ali of the Baltimore Islamic Community watched the President as he shuffled right past the mosque reception committee, and straight to the men’s restroom.

“As soon as he entered the mosque, he lowered his gaze, mumbled salam and headed for the restroom,” said Ali as he recalled his first encounter with the President earlier today. “I could hear him fill up a green plastic vessel with water and shut the bathroom stall door… you know, to wash his… presidential… butt.”

“It’s like he’s done this every day of his life.”

Prior to prayer, Muslims are required to ‘purify’ themselves through a series of steps that involve rinsing parts of their bodies.

After the evening Athan (call to prayer), Obama assumed the role of leading the congregation.

Thirty-four-year-old mosque attendee Tariq Ahmed stood bewildered as he observed Obama easily go through motions of the prayer with an impressive recitation of Quranic passages.

“Before he started, he looked back and instructed us to straighten our lines,” said Ahmed. “He said ‘Shoulder to shoulder, pray every salat as if it’s your last. You never know when one of my drones can be off by 1-2 degrees.’”

Obama recited the entire Surah Ya-Sin during the first half of the prayer, with many congregants floored by his accurate pronunciation and inflection.

After prayers, and with miswak in hand, Obama made a few announcements and implored the community to donate generously. He then ushered himself back to a blocked-in presidential limo.",Obama Effortlessly Leads Prayers During Mosque Visit,http://islamicanews.com/obama-effortlessly-leads-evening-prayers-during-mosque-visit/,islamicanews.com

The 29-year-old Ghafour, who is a scholar in Islam and other religions, is described by many to be incredibly good looking. He stands at six-foot-three inches with a chiseled face, an ideal masculine form, and brown eyes so deep “you could swim in them.”

“This Friday we will explore the doubtful matters,” he says with a subtle middle eastern accent as he unleashes a warm and inviting smile.

Ghafour is expected to cover topics drizzled in ambiguity such as music from stringed instruments, intoxications from caffeine, and low bearing interest checking accounts. He will also talk about the deviant lives of those who eat makruh animals.

Paducah, KY – John McAllister isn’t leaving anything to chance. The 28 year old bald-shaven, blue-eyed Kentucky native with a troubled past, is determined to follow through on a premeditated scheme of carnage; one that he says will have to be reported on as an act of terrorism.

“I gotta get this right,” says McAllister as he taps his shiny black Dr. Martens boots against the desk. He carefully reviews his plan of attack, along with floor plans of an undisclosed office building. To date, he’s run through several simulation drills and compiled an inventory of evidence for a probable investigation.

“Did you know of the last 22 mass shootings in this country, only one was labeled a terrorist act? And do you know why that one was? Because the dude was brown… Immigrants are messin’ up EVERYTHING. Not anymore!”

A nervous McAllister then paces around his office, one that is adorned with nazi symbols and white supremacist rhetoric.

“They’re going to try to peg the ‘shooter’ label on me. Don’t let them… DO NOT LET THEM… It’s so condescending.”

McAllister pulls out a short stack of items he hopes the authorities will find during an inevitable raid of his two-bedroom apartment.

“Here’s a binder that should serve as a manifesto, leaving no doubt that my plan is to inflict maximum damage on civilians and my motive is driven by my vision of an immigrant-free USA. I’ve also included a manila folder with my medical records — full analysis of my mental health, demonstrating my impeccable sanity, just in case they attempt the whole ‘mentally-ill’ angle on me.”

Shortly following, McAllister holds up a homemade DVD with the words ‘Terrorism Evidence’ scribbled across the top surface with a permanent marker.

“Now this is the crowning achievement, the catch-all if you will. This has videos of me training on a jungle gym and stumbling across an obstacle course. In case, you know, they need background stock footage for all that endless coverage they like to do.”

The soon to be shooter – ehem – terrorist, also calls out one video in which he repeats the phrase ‘This is terrorism” non-stop for 10 minutes.

“Unfortunately I won’t be around to hear what they end up calling it, since I plan to shoot myself afterwards. We typically do that, you know? That’s why the folks on the news nearly always get it wrong. Brown people equal terrorism, white people equal mentally ill shooters. I wish the world would just see us for the extremist we really are. I guess that’s affirmative action for ya.”

As the clock struck noon, John McAllister polished his assault rifle, packed in it a carrying case, and then eagerly headed out the door.

Taraweeh is an evening supplication typically performed during Ramadan and consists of a recitation of the entire Holy Quran. Because the prayer includes all verses from the holy book, Muslims will spread taraweeh over 30 days. However, due to the Imam’s rapid pace, the Mexican mosque is expected to complete Taraweeh much, much earlier.

“Señor Imam Speedy is incredibly fast in his recitation,” says long time mosque attendant Sylvester the cat, as he wiped the drool from his rodent-fasting mouth. “Suffering succotash, it’s hard to keep up with him.”

“I remember thinking it didn’t make any sense… aren’t they already home?!?”

As the scandal unfolded, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, issued the following statement on Monday morning during a scheduled press conference:

“What the Chief Strategist clearly meant to say is that those Muslims should go more home, even more than they were currently at the time. Like if you’re in the front of your home, you should move to the center. Look it’s not a bad thing to go home since that’s where your bed and toothbrush is. Who doesn’t like a bed?

Schaumburg, IL – In response to mounting pressure from the community, mosque officials issued a press release about their socially awkward Imam, assuring members that he is scandal-free.

“After an exhaustive assessment of Imam Khalid Azeem’s activities, the board has found no improper behavior, and ZERO opportunities for any allegations at this time,” said ISGS President Ibrahim Latif.

“With his inability to connect to the youth, his irrelevant sermons, and his inapproachable demeanor, Brother Khalid remains harmless to even the most vulnerable members of our community.”

Latif went on to note that Azeem’s online personality is just as trivial, with only 8 followers on Twitter (mostly family members) and a Facebook page that’s rarely updated. He once accidentally streamed a sermon live on Facebook while his phone was in his pocket.

Latif also mentioned that the mosque tracked the Imam’s free-time activities, saying that Azeem spends an exorbitant amount of time miswak-ing his teeth.

“He really goes to town on that upper left cuspid.”

One member of the community remarked that Azeem’s last sermon, ‘Don’t Do Bad Things and Stuff,’ mostly implored worshippers to use only one paper towel after performing wudu.

Azeem, who has been Imam at the mosque for over five years, fulfills his role in a bare minimum fashion. Aside from sermons and prayers, Azeem occasionally attends community outreach activities with very limited participation.

Senior Pastor John Denna, whose Lutheran Church is adjacent to the ISGC, describes his interactions with Azeem as “challenging.”

“At last week’s interfaith dialogue, he walked in, shook our hand, mumbled something about Jesus also being a Prophet in Islam, and then hid behind a curtain for the rest of the night,” said a perplexed Denna.

“We knew he was hiding there. You could see his bathroom slippers poking out from the bottom of the curtains.”

Further complicating matters was a crowd of reporters who followed the NFL’s 4th leading rusher into the facility. Tensions flared when Lynch and several reporters refused to take off their shoes prior to entering the prayer hall. Things escalated as reporters repeatedly questioned Lynch during the sermon.

For approximately 40 minutes, the running back repeated the phrase, “I’m just here so I don’t get fined.” At one point, Lynch mistakenly went into “beast mode” requiring him to re-perform the obligatory “wudu” cleansing and restart his sermon.

This is the scene at todays anti-Islam protest in a Phoenix area mosque parking lot. The demonstrators, largely comprised of local-area biker gangs, had their motorcycles boxed in by Muslim latecomers oblivious to conventional parking protocol.

“I’m late for work!” exclaimed Jon Dougin, a frustrated protestor and self-proclaimed patriot. “My damn bike’s surrounded by three cars and I can’t go nowhere! Never seen these many Camrys in my life!”

The anti-Islam protestors maintain they are peaceful, as many brandish semi-automatic weapons while families with children walk past.

“There I was gripping my TEC-9, sneering at some raghead toddler,” said a peaceful protestor who goes by the name Haterade.

Haterade was shocked to witness such blatant disregard of parking etiquette, remarking, “Who are these savages?!?”

Another biker claimed he wasn’t part of the biker gang rally, but rather part of the Muslim Tableeghi Jama’at.

Demonstrators were further frustrated by the Muslims’ lack of punctuality, having to endure the congregation’s hour-long delay. Inside the mosque, leaders could be heard over the P.A. system announcing a long list of makes, models and license plates of cars allegedly blocking protestors’ motorcycles.

“Brothers, I tell you every damn week. If you’re blocking cars in the parking lot, move out right away,” announced Kamal Ashfaq, director of the Islamic Community of Phoenix. “That principle also applies to motorcycles and, should the need arise, unicycles.”

Delayed, some confused and hungry protestors succumbed to their hunger and bought food being sold for a mosque fundraiser, including tea and middle-eastern shwarmas.

“I heard they were selling beer,” said Haterade. “But it’s really some [expletive] they call Beer Yaani? Anyways it’s [expletive] delicious.”

As of 4PM, a small group of demonstrators could still be seen sitting on their bikes waiting for the remaining congregants to move their cars.

280,280,2015-07-08 10:15:12+00:00,"CHICAGO, IL – Muslims of Indian and Pakistani descent are demanding a return to their roots, rejecting the recent “Arabization” of their language and culture.

“The transient subcontinent culture takes great pride in arbitrarily deleting vowels, syllables, and logic when borrowing words and ideas from other cultures,” explained Professor Shakeel Ahmed from the University of Indians and Chinese (UIC). “Not long ago, Muslims from the subcontinent would say Khuda Hafiz when leaving someone’s house during Ramzan“.

“We won’t be told what to do by dirty Arabs!”

Ahmed elaborated terms such as “Ramadan” are attempts to reform the longstanding “Ramzan” mispronunciation of their Persian ancestors. Other example include “Allah Hafiz” recently supplanting “Khuda Hafiz” and “Assalamualaikum” replacing the traditional “Slalekum.”

“We’re also willing to accept variants such as ‘Salekum,’ ‘Asakalekum,’ and random gargling sounds. Maybe even ‘Namaste.’ We want to return to an arbitrary point in history we consider our roots, but must be careful not going so far back we become Hindu again, or worse – primates.”

“That’s exactly what the jinns want.”

Others are joining Ahmed in pushing for “Desi Muslim Pride.”

“Sorry for being late,” explained Pervez Khan, founder of the Desi Urban Muslim Pride (DUMP) Parade. Arriving two hours late to our interview, he offered no explanation for his tardiness.

“Anyway this year, we are taking DUMP to next level. We will have floats with all colors of the rainbow and signs with original Hindi and Urdu words all over them. No Arabic! Allah Miya wants this!” explained Khan, “Devon Avenue will be plastered with DUMP!”

Khan anticipates the DUMP Parade taking place “later this month or something like that” but many are skeptical. Traditionally in past years, DUMP organizers have delayed festivities while haggling city officials for required license fees.

“Major League Baseball is committed to building a culture of diversity and inclusion throughout the game,” MLB’s commissioner, Rob Manfred, said in a statement.

“We realize that the inaccurate portrayal of an Indian with a Native American has caused grief and pain to many. We can only imagine how Indian Americans as well as Indians all over the world must have felt through this ignorance and oversight.”

“If we’re really being honest, I blame Christopher Columbus for this mess.”

Per the Islamic tradition, Muslims are required to abstain from food and drink between sunrise and sunset during the holy month of Ramadan.

“Some of our honored guests have expressed concern that ingestion of water may nullify their fasts. Therefore, I want to assure everyone that any attempts to waterboard you will be well after sunset,” announced Haspel to a room full of foreign dignitaries representing various parts of the Muslim world.

“It would be a shame that your day-long sacrifices go to waste as a result of our attempts to extract potentially useful information in the name of national security. Trust us when we say we admire your discipline and dedication to the faith.”

Haspel considered carrying out some torture prior to dusk, but felt the risks of prematurely breaking the fast was too great.

“One single stream of water from backed-up nostrils into the mouth and down the throat, and all of a sudden you’ll have some very angry Muslims to deal with.”

This year is the first time President Trump hosted an Iftar, amidst the perception that his administration isn’t friendly to Muslims.

During sunset, Trump could be seen struggling to swallow a date, the fruit traditionally used to open the fast.

“Nobody told me these squishy things had seeds,” mumbled Trump as part of a tooth fell out of his mouth.

An official from Saudi Arabia stood by, staring at the POTUS in awe.

“I’ve never seen an orange eat a date,” gasped the unidentified official.

White House staff pulled together a unique list of menu items, including Chef Sebastian Gorka’s signature Porkorays, Beer-Yani, and Taqiyya Tacos.

WASHINGTON DC –

In the wake of Justice Anthony Kennedy’s announced retirement from the US Supreme Court, President Trump moved swiftly today to nominate internet meme Scumbag Steve as the replacement for the 81-year old judge.

Met At A Key Party At Mar-A-Lago

The president, a longtime fan of the erstwhile internet sensation, reportedly met Mr. Steve at a key party thrown by one of his guests at his Palm Beach resort.

“Scumbag Steve is one of the funniest guys you will ever meet. He had me in stitches with that coat of his – and that hat. And he was also very smart about the law. He could tell you 10 different ways you could get off for possession of marijuana in New Jersey. And let me tell you, they were very good tips.”

“I have no doubt he will make an excellent Supreme Court justice and I’m sure will be confirmed very quickly by the other justices.”

Never Been To Law School

Although Scumbag Steve has not passed the bar, studied law, or even graduated from high school, the president was enthusiastic about installing him on the highest court of the land.

“Steve will be the best Supreme Court justice ever. I know he will make the best decisions based on his years of experience defending against petty misdemeanors and other crimes of convenience, for which he was never convicted. In addition, he will bring a youthful exuberance and flair for fashion that is sorely needed in government.”

When reached for comment, Scumbag Steve said that he was not sure why the president thought he should be a judge, but he was damn sure he would do a better job than that fucking philosophical dinosaur.

HOLLYWOOD, CA –

After 15 years of experimentation, the producers of the ABC hit TV show “The Bachelorette” made a change to the show’s format this week.

Having determined that 20 weeks of reality TV show competition was no better at finding a good match than plain dumb luck, it was decided the contestant in next season’s show will simply select a winner at random.

The new show, titled “The Bacheroulette,” will consist of one ten-minute episode during which a woman spins a wheel and waits for a ball to drop into the slot beside a man’s name who will be her new husband.

Absolutely The Same Result

“Yep, we’ve done all the math on this one, and these women have just as good a shot of getting a decent guy picking a name out of a goldfish bowl as they do undergoing 20 excruciating weeks of nonstop dating and talking,” said Bacheroulette show runner David Mithompson.

“In fact, we predict our rate of successful marriages will triple using our new model of completely random match-making.”

Turns Out All Husbands Are The Same

While conventional wisdom holds that traits like compatibility and mutual attractiveness are key ingredients to a successful marriage, the show’s staff found out that’s not really the case.

“The behavior of individual men during the dating process can vary dramatically,” said Mr. Mithompson, “but husbands, as a group, don’t really differ much at all.”

A woman may FEEL like she’s getting the cream of the crop after a lengthy courtship, but once a man marries, the producers discovered, he enters what’s called the ‘husband state’.

“Husband State”

“Husband state is the process of the adult male’s adaptation to married life,” according to Dr. William Freargarten of the Roosevelt College of Psychology.

“After the marriage ceremony, the human male regresses to a child-like dependence on his partner,” said Dr. Freargarten. “No longer under the pressures of courtship, he gradually forgets all previous learning related to laundry, cooking, sewing, house-cleaning, and general hygiene.”

Tasks he would have performed with ease several months prior to marriage now become exceedingly difficult for the adult male. “Until at last, he reaches a state of complete dependence on another human being to do everything for him, without whose help he would not survive,” said Dr. Freargarten.

Show Still Expects To Turn A Profit

Given the situation, the producers opted to cut to the chase.

“Once we realized the implications of ‘husband state’ as it relates to our contestants, we just didn’t feel it was right to subject them to all that drama, when a spin of the wheel would work just as well.”

While the network will lose out on some ad revenue, the loss will be more than offset by dramatically reduced production costs. “It’s not cheap to fly an entire camera crew onto a glacier along with snowmobiles, a table and chairs, a chef, and a full five-course dinner including filet mignon and a bottle of chilled Veuve Clicquot,” Mr. Mithompson said.

“We figure we can crank out 10 or 15 seasons in an 8-hour shoot day easy,” he said. “The men on the show have the option of proposing on the spot if their name comes up, or if the wheel shows double 00, everybody gets to go home. It’s a lot of fun.”

Odds are 3 to 12 that ‘The Bacheroulette’ will air the first Wednesday of every month thru 2028.

OMAHA, NB –

The American multinational conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, made a surprising discovery this week when one of its accountants realized the company had accidentally purchased the entire state of New Hampshire during a large trade last Tuesday.

The transaction, involving several thousand shares of company stock valued at over 15 billion dollars, came to light when an employee in charge of SEC compliance was reviewing a ledger and saw that the state had been part of an equities-for-land swap.

Residents Unaware They Had Been Purchased

Rhode Island, which joined the union in 1790 and is home to over one million residents, became part of the Berkshire Hathaway fold without much fanfare.

Lieutenant Governor Daniel McKee acknowledged the new ownership, saying that although the state would have liked some advanced notice before the purchase, not much would likely change for its citizens.

“While some residents might find it disconcerting to be the property of a billionaire businessman who lives 1,600 miles away, the Berkshire Hathaway group has a proven track record of success, and employs a “hands off” approach that we feel will provide a nice compliment to our can-do attitude at the state government level.”

State Severely Under-Valued

While the famously profitable holding company founded by investor Warren Buffet does not routinely purchase states in entirety, a spokesman said the company was pleased with the acquisition, as Rhode Island was worth several times what the company paid for it when valued on a “direct cash flow” basis.

A press release touted the new investment:

“BH is more than thrilled to acquire this rising star in the United States which has a price-per-share earnings that is equivalent to states of a much larger size. While there will be some headwinds in the coming years to overcome given the needed infrastructure investment, we expect Rhode Island to outperform same-in-class states on a per capita basis for both the near and long term, and are forecasting a 13% return on investment for our shareholders.

The state will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the abbreviation RDI.",Berkshire Hathaway Discovers It Owns Rhode Island During Routine Audit,http://makeamericathebest.com/2018/06/25/berkshire-hathaway-discovers-it-owns-rhode-island-during-routine-audit/,makeamericathebest.com

PRINCETON, NJ –

Leaving his home recording studio behind to take a long bike ride and look for a good coffee shop, a man leaning on his bicycle with crossed arms decided against busting some ill rhymes this morning after breakfast.

“Yesterday I was ready to lay down this new joint, but for some reason when I got on the mic after my cornflakes, there was no flow. So, I went for a bike ride,” said the man, leaning on his bicycle.

Not Hard Today

“Typically I’m spitting for real from about 10am to noon on Saturdays. Then I take a break for a sandwich, usually egg salad or something like that, and then I wail for another hour or so before catching a movie.”

“I was all set to finesse some lines, but for whatever reason, it was like skrrt – skrrt.” said the man, who unfolded his arms to make a waving motion. “Definitely not vibing.”

Looking For Antique Tins

Deciding to hit the farmer’s market instead, the man was going to shop for a unique country store tin to keep his mic cables in. “I like mostly 40’s advertising – butter pails – and any tins with rural scenes,” he said. “They’re basically just flex pieces, but some of them are worth a little money.”

Although the man leaning on his bicycle was going low key today, he fully anticipated dropping salad hardcore next week. Especially if he was inspired by the right tin.

“If all goes well, this time next week, I’m gonna feel like buying Burger King, and eating it at McDonalds.”

The bike, which is stored in the basement studio and hears most of the man’s musical output, had no comment.

WASHINGTON DC –

As the nation grieves the shooting deaths of four people in a Nashville restaurant by an assailant with an assault rifle, a group of people who spend every waking moment at the White House gate asking to see the president expressed thanks to the NRA for fighting hard every day to protect their right to carry automatic weapons.

Right To Bear Arms

“It’s no secret that liberals mean to deprive me of my right to select the assault weapon of my choice to shoot as I see fit,” said Morris Grandbergen of Norbin, Oklahoma, who has spent the last 3 weeks yelling thru the fence at the White House demanding the president come out and meet his pet turtle.

“Make no mistake, there is nothing the government would like better than to remove the 6,000 rounds of high-powered hollow-point ammunition and small arsenal of automatic weapons I have assembled in my garage,” said Mr. Grandbergen. “I am just thankful that the NRA has my back, so that I can devote my time to writing the White House thirty-two letters a day asking to schedule an appointment for President Trump to meet Wilfred Snapper.”

Knitted Over 3,000 Bears For President

Janice Meddlesbrough of Seemans, North Dakota, was also glad that the NRA works hard to preserve her right to carry concealed weapons.

“I knit my first batch of bears for President Bush back in 2004,” said the former grade school teacher and gun enthusiast. “It was only brown bears back then, but I’ve knit green bears, purple bears, and even stripeys thru the years.”

“I don’t have time to combat the deep state conspiracy to take away my seven M-24 long range rifles with military grade scopes. But luckily, the NRA does. So I can focus on knitting this orange bear with a handlebar mustachio for our commander-in-chief.”

Wants To Share Leech Collection

“There are over 32,000 different species of leeches in my collection,” said Roman Marlswark of Secauphony, Mississippi. “But I name only the most handsome specimens after Presidents.”

“President Gerald Leech, President Richard Leech, President Jimmy Leech. I’ve named them all. And I am very thankful that the NRA is protecting my right to encircle the first floor of my house with machine gun nests to protect my valuable collection, so I can devote my time to my leech presidents.”

Mr. Marlswark, who emails the White House every day asking to visit, said “it would be my greatest honor to someday introduce President Trump to his namesake President Donald Leech. And also discuss the fact that dinosaurs still live in parts of Western Canada.”

Can Recite The Lord Of The Rings Backwards

“I don’t know if the NRA supports my right to own the 24 rocket-propelled grenades and various other explosives I keep in my house,” said Norm Writewater of Trailsdale, Arizona. “But I’ve never heard them say they DIDN’T support them.”

“Either way, I’m glad they are busy preserving my cherished second amendment rights. It allows me to spend every waking hour memorizing the 1,178 pages of the ‘Lord Of The Rings’ backwards, which I hope to repeat for the president in person very soon over a horn of mead, and a filet of dragon meat.”

“That is, just as soon as my restraining order expires and I’m allowed within 1,000 yards of the White House gates.”

JERSEY CITY, NJ –

In a move to add more muscle to the group of lawyers preparing to defend him against possible allegations from the Mueller investigation, President Trump today announced that Hulk Hogan would join his legal defense “Lightening Strike Force Team”.

“The Hulkster is well known in legal circles which many people do not know. And he has a terrific body slam which anyone who knows my style knows I will appreciate,” said the president.

A History Of Winning

The president also expressed confidence that Mr. Hogan’s storied career in the World Wrestling Federation, New Japan Pro Wrestling Organization, and American Wrestling Association would translate to victory in the courtroom.

“I still remember the ‘Bask At The Beach’ when the Hulkster took on Ric Flair in Orlando. Truly one of the great sporting matches of our time,” said the president. “And his take down of Macho Man Randy Savage in Wrestlemania 5 was epic.”

“If the Hulkster were to throw just one of Robert Mueller’s men over the top rope like he did to Randy Savage that night, this investigation would be over in a heartbeat. That’s all I’m saying.”

Familiar With The Fake Media

Although not an attorney himself, Mr. Hogan was a plaintiff in the lawsuit that ultimately bankrupted Gawker Media. The lawsuit centered around the website’s publishing of a sex tape involving the former wrestler which was surreptitiously recorded.

“You never know what’s going to happen in a wrestling match, but the Hulkster always seems to come out on top no matter what,” said the president. “He also knows what it’s like to have the fake media create tapes of things you never said or did, and broadcast them over the airwaves right before an election.”

Mr. Hogan has never contested the authenticity of the sex tape.

Unstoppable

“As the supervisor of both my newly created ‘Commando Law & Order Patrol’, and the ‘Extreme Vetting Squad,’ Hulk Hogan will take down any lawyer anywhere, just like he took down a multi-million dollar media empire, using his legal savvy.”

“With Hulk Hogan on my team, there is no question I will prevail.”

Saying he has long been searching for a way to further the cause of space exploration while keeping his promise to cut the federal budget in half, President Trump announced today that he had found a solution for NASA. The answer: tiny astronauts.

Tiny Astronauts Do Not Take Up Much Room

“The brightest minds have been working on this question for decades,” the President said. “And I have come up with a solution in just my first year in office.”

The President realized that tiny astronauts, or “mininauts” as he called them, would weigh much less than regular astronauts, so more of them can be packed onto the ship and require just half the fuel.

“Not only do the mininauts weigh less, but they eat less, too,” he said. “So we do not have to send so much food. We can ship an army of mininauts to the moon, who will be able to do twice as many experiments and move twice as fast as regular astronauts, because their tiny arms and legs are so light.”

Should Have Asked Me Sooner

The President chided NASA for wasting a lot taxpayer’s money trying to find a solution when the answer was so simple.

“This is why it’s so valuable to have smart business people like myself running the government. All the scientists, they don’t know what they are doing. Honestly, they could have saved themselves a lot of trouble if they had just come to me sooner. I would have told them what to do right away.”

Other Advantages

Mininauts will have other advantages over regular sized astronauts, according to the White House:

Their tiny hands will allow them to do smaller experiments, like measuring the weight of a cheeto on the moon

Mininauts will all be able to fit in one car for the ticker tape parade

The American people will like them more, since they will be roughly the size of a Minion



No Date To The Prom

When asked if the scientists at NASA appreciated the President’s suggestion, the President replied: “Probably not. But who cares? None of them could get dates to the prom anyway. You should have seen the date I took. Believe me when I tell you, she was unbelievable. Rockets out to here.”

“My thrusters were really working back then, too,” he added.

NASA’s miniature astronaut program will begin accepting applications in the spring, just as soon as congress passes a tiny bill that the President will sign with a little pen tucked inside his smallish hand.

THUNDERDOME –

In a final showdown to determine who will claim the mantle of Keepers of the Ultimate Truth, the forces of the Flat Earth Society, and believers that the US moon landing was a fake, will face off against each other in an epic war over the fate of the cosmos.

Unavoidable Battle Brewing For Centuries

“We have dreaded this day for many years,” said Fren Wu, Professor Emeritus at The Truth University of Oxford Christs Church, “but diplomacy has failed and unfortunately, this is the only way forward.”

As foretold, the contestants will take the field on the plains of Valhalla, New Mexico, at a time mutually agreeable to each camp, and will engage each other in what will surely be a horrific scene of carnage not seen for millennia.

Survivors of that conflict, of which there are expected to be few, will be brought to the hills of Har-Meggido outside of Reno, where they will wage a climactic final battle to the death.

Lizard-People Theorists, Supply-Side Economists, Elvis Death Denialists, Obama Birthers, and assorted Knights Templar have been enlisted to bear away the dead as they fall, and to inscribe their names on the Tablets of Immortal Knowledge.

Each Side Confident They Will Prevail

Proponents of the fake moon landings mocked the flat earth theory as “a ludicrous reading of an easily verifiable set of facts,” pointing out that many people have flown around the world in an airplane. While the Flat Earth Society, for their part, called the fake moon landers “absurd crackpots” preoccupied with grainy video and ignorant of the outside world, which, as anyone can see, is plainly flat.

Available On Pay-Per-View

As expected, Grand Master Trump will preside over the conflict from his chamber of darkness concealed by a web of mists that is impenetrable to any mortal. He will view the spectacle on HBO pay-per-view until battles end, whereupon he will issue a Tweet proclaiming the loser as the victor.

WILLIAMSBURG, BROOKLYN –

Although convinced you had already found all of the possible ways that you could hold singer-songwriter and actress Beyonce Knowles-Carter in the highest esteem, workers this week renovating your building made the surprising discovery of yet another way for you to admire the talented music and pop culture superstar.

Part Of Larger Build Out

The renovations, which were authorized by your condo association last June, required that the workers remove a layer of sheet rock in one of the hallways near the stairs. It was there that they stumbled across the new way to adore the hip hop icon and mother of three.

“You never know what you’re going to find when you start peeling back the layers,” said Ralph Laurencello, the foreman on the construction project. “As soon as the panel was removed, we could see that this was a new access to appreciating Beyonce that had been part of an earlier floor plan, but had not been used for some time.”

Completely Unexpected

Already overwhelmed by the cuteness of her children, uncompromising artistic performances, fantastic hair, excellent business skills, willingness to make amends with her husband, and unparalleled dancing and singing, the discovery of an entirely new pathway to appreciate the Queen B was completely unexpected.

“We’ve contacted the architect to see if there’s a way we can incorporate this new feature into the building,” said Building Superintendent Franklin Kotzke. “Although there are plenty of ways we can all value the amazing person that Ms. Knowles-Carter is, finding yet another avenue for our veneration seems like something we should try and preserve for future tenants, if at all possible.”

Already busy at work to integrate the new discovery into the overall design of the building, architects are hoping to have the work completed in time for the next amazing thing that Beyonce does, which everyone agrees will probably make her even more impressive and awe-inspiring than she is now already.

As if that were possible.

ANTARCTICA –

Fed up with years of inactivity by the vast majority of human beings on the planet, penguins across the southern hemisphere today headed north to finally kick some major ass.

The tiny flightless birds, promising an ass-whooping like the human race has never seen, swarmed into the oceans and began swimming furiously toward major cities across the globe including New York, London, and Beijing.

In New York’s Central Park, angry penguins encountered a group of tourists and shouted at them, promising to give them “a beat down like they would not believe” if they did not join the Paris Climate Accords immediately.

While not known for their aggressive nature, a spokesperson for the penguins said that they have tried reasoning with humans, but obviously that has not produced results, “so the penguins have decided to take matters into their own flippers”.

The penguins further said that the human race had better do something this week about climate change, or they will be back next Tuesday and we “wouldn’t want to see the kind of shit that was going to go down if that happens.”

STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN –

The Swedish Nobel Committee on behalf of the Alfred Nobel Memorial Foundation today announced Dennis Rodman will be nominated, and almost assuredly will win, its Peace Prize for his outreach to the DPRK, and efforts to establish a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.

First Time Nomination Has Been Released In Advance

Normally, the Nobel committee refrains from announcing nominations, and a winner is not chosen until October. But given the overwhelming support for Mr. Rodman, the members felt it important to announce his nomination now.

“There really was no other choice for this year’s award, so we decided that we would make the nomination public, with the prize being all but a foregone conclusion,” said Rolf Overgren, spokesperson of the Royal Order of Bergerson, which handles publicity for the organization.

“There is no one else under serious consideration at this time. And we don’t anticipate that to change.”

Prestigious Company

The 5-time champion and 2-time defensive player of the year who still holds the NBA record for career rebounding average takes his place among great peacemakers such as Martin Luther King Jr, Lech Walesa, and Mother Theresa.

“The world owes Mr. Rodman a debt of gratitude for opening the door that led a reclusive regime to join the human race in celebrating the opportunities of a peaceful coexistence, and a final end to the 65 year war that has taken such a toll on millions of people,” said Mr. Overgen.

First Basketball, Then Talk

While he let his fellow players do the talking on the court, Mr. Rodman befriended the head of North Korea, Kim Jong-Un, showing the wary leader that westerners, and Americans in particular, could be both trustworthy and good partners.

His five visits to the embattled communist country were at first scandalous, then ridiculed, and finally, gave birth to a peace agreement that will bring relief to 75 million people.

“Without Dennis Rodman, there would still be a war going on. Who else can say that?” Mr. Overgren asked.

No Suspense This October

A statement from the Nobel Committee all but awarded the prize:

“While we have, since 1901, eschewed previews of the selection committee’s decision, in this one case, we feel it only right to put the world on notice that Dennis Rodman is the sole nominee under consideration for the Nobel Peace Prize.” “Mr. Rodman has always been a great rebounder. And the committee would like to acknowledge his tireless efforts in plucking North Korea from the backboard of injustice, and delivering it to a fast break of prosperity, and good will for the people of Southeast Asia.” “No one has done as much for peace between the two Koreas. In fact, it would be a joke to suggest that the committee contemplate anyone else. And so we say, thank you, Dennis Rodman, on behalf of the people of Korea, of the people of Asia, and indeed, of the people of planet earth.”

Mr. Rodman is expected to skip the award ceremony, unless of course he happens to be in Sweden that day, and there is nothing else going on dog.

QUEBEC CITY –

Despite repeated coaching from the six other allied leaders on how to form the individual letters that make up the words “Donald Trump”, the US president was unable to sign the joint statement at the end of the G7 summit this week hosted by the Canadian government.

“He just wasn’t getting it,” said a G7 conference spokesman. “They all went over the spelling of his name several times. It’s not that many letters, but for whatever reason, it wasn’t sinking in.”

Tried Having His Hand Trace The Letters

In hopes that the United States would sign on to the document in a show of solidarity, the various world leaders each took a turn demonstrating how easy it was to write the words “Donald Trump”.

“They requested a white board and some dry erase markers and showed the President how to start the “D” with a straight line, and then a big curve. They tried everything in the book, even singing the alphabet song.”

Said one aid who did not want to be named: “Chancellor Merkel held his hand and traced each letter – calling them out as they wrote them together “D – O – N- “… but when she was done, he just waved his hand and shrugged. They couldn’t get him to even try.”

New Rules For Signatures

In an attempt to avoid a similar awkward situation at the next G7 summit, the members proposed a rule change allowing for an “X” to signify a leader’s signature, as long as the other members were present to witness.

“We’re pretty sure he can make an X,” said the aid. “Put just in case, they’re making any kind of mark made with a pen acceptable.”

The next G7 summit will be held in Biarritz, France, in 2019.

WASHINGTON DC –

In an announcement that caused major confusion throughout the diplomatic world, President Trump today signed an executive order recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of the country of Iraq.

Although the city of Jerusalem has existed for thousands of years within the current borders of Israel, the President said that his decision was final, and that the United States will begin moving its embassy to the new location immediately.

What Does This Mean?

Heads of state throughout the Middle East and beyond were grappling with the implications of the President’s stance.

“What does the President intend by this? Does the entire city of Jerusalem need to be moved stone by stone to Iraq? Or is it just the people that have to relocate?” said the Foreign Minister of Jordan, Salam Yusef.

“And what about the language barriers? Will the citizens of Jerusalem be required to learn Arabic? I do not think Iraqis are going to be excited about learning Hebrew – that much I can tell you.”

Jerusalem Has Always Been The Capital Of Iraq

“Today we finally acknowledge the obvious,” the President said as he signed the official executive order “This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. Jerusalem has always been the capital of Iraq. And it always will be.”

The President went on to say: “there will of course be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement. But we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a place of greater understanding and cooperation.”

Seeking Clarification

Although the President was not immediately available to clarify his exact intentions, a spokesperson for the White House said that he believes what the President meant to say is that he was recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of all of the Middle East.

World War III will begin Monday.

After a disappointing take at the box office and multiple distractions during a challenging opening night, the producers of the gun-friendly musical “Burr” decided to call it quits and closed the show after a one day run.

The production, a country music-inspired homage to the central character Aaron Burr, extolled the virtues of owning guns and using them to defend yourself against immigrants with crazy ideas like Alexander Hamilton, who was shot dead by Burr during a duel in 1804.

Questionable Marketing Tactics

“In hind site, hiring pickup trucks to drive around Times Square with confederate flags probably wasn’t the best idea,” said Marvin Biangolo, Brand Strategy Liaison for the PR firm Footlights Inc. “We were hoping to capitalize on the ground swell of support for the second amendment, but apparently a lot of people were just plain offended.”



Fistfights In The Lobby

A scene in keeping with the raucous times of Aaron Burr’s life developed before the show even started, as protesters clashed with each other over gun rights in front of the lobby bar of the Robert Moses Theater. Two men were sent to the hospital for stitches from a broken bottle, and several lobby ropes were severely damaged.

A group of white nationalists also stormed the concession stand during intermission when they found out that American cheese was not an option as a condiment for nachos, causing the producers to call in the police.

Wouldn’t Be Caught Dead In NYC

“I think the main miscalculation in all of this,” said Executive Producer Sly Silverstein, “was the belief that the target audience for this show would even set foot in New York, let alone come to see a musical theater production.”

“Songs like ‘You’ll Be Back-Stabbed’, and ‘Guns And Ships, But Especially Guns’, tested well in focus groups. But if the people don’t come out to the theater to see the show, it’s not going to matter how good the songs are,” he remarked.

Although the New York run was a bust, the producers hope to offset any losses when the show tours parts of the rural south and northeastern US later this year. “Of course, we’ll have to re-cast some of the parts played by minority actors in the production,” said Mr. Biangolo. “But with any luck, we’ll more than make up for the show closing early.”

“And then some,” he added.

PYEONGCHANG, SOUTH KOREA –

Olympians celebrating the end of the 2018 Winter Games had a little bit of a ceremony hangover after their final night in Pyeongchang.

Partying in a wild orgy of drinking, cavorting and general mayhem, athletes from around the globe left an Olympic village strewn with beer cups, cigarette butts, and used condoms, prompting the International Olympic Committee to invoke a rarely-used penalty clause in the Winter Games lease agreement.

The agreement, which the athletes signed when they arrived, allows the IOC to confiscate the athletes’ damage deposit and charge cleaning fees for “failure to return the Olympic premises to its original state.”

Not Mincing Words

This was not the first run in with the campus authority for the Olympians, and the Committee was in no mood to overlook their youthful exhuberance.

In a statement to representatives of the athletes who were recovering in their tents, the Head Dean of the Olympic Committee, Verner Von Wermer said:

“Well, well, well. Looks like somebody forgot there’s a rule against alcoholic beverages in Olympic Villages on probation. You’re out! Finished! I want you off this Olympic campus at nine o’clock Monday morning, and I’ve contacted your local draft boards and told them that you are all, all eligible for military service.”

Totally Bogus

In response to the harsh action taken by the Dean, snowboarder and gold medal winner Shaun White held a press conference and gave the athletes’ response:

Ladies and gentlemen, I’ll be brief. The issue here is not whether we broke a few rules, or took a few liberties — we did. But you can’t hold a whole Olympic Village responsible for the behavior of a few, sick perverted individuals. For if you do, then shouldn’t we blame the whole Olympic system? And if the whole Olympic system is guilty, then isn’t this an indictment of our athletic institutions in general? I put it to you: isn’t this an indictment of our entire global society? Well, you can do what you you want to us, Dean Von Wermer, but we’re not going to sit here and listen to you badmouth the united athletes of the Olympic Winter Games. Gentlemen!

And with that, Mr. White exited the press conference followed by Jessica Diggens, Red Gerard, Dorfman, Neidermeyer, and John Blutarsky.

WASHINGTON DC –

President Donald Trump demonstrated his resolute commitment to reining in trade deficits with China this week by enacting punishing tariffs on the nation’s closest ally, Canada, vowing that they would not end until China changes the way it does business with the United States.

US Can No Longer Stand Idly By

Saying the US would no longer be complacent in the face of China’s multi-billion dollar advantage in trade, the President proposed steep tariffs on his country’s closest ally and friend, Canada, in hopes that China would finally end its unfair practices.

“China needs to be brought under control,” said the President from the White House Rose Garden this morning.

“For too long, the United States stood by as China used cheap labor to produce goods at low prices, making it very difficult for US companies to compete. This is why my administration is taking immediate action, by enacting high tariffs on our close ally Canada which we will hammer on, and keep in place, until China changes its tune.”

Countries Both Start With Letter “C”

While it was unclear why the President chose to start a trade war with a country that shares a 5,000 mile border, speaks the same language, and has been a loyal friend to the US for hundreds of years, aides in the White House said the President was simply doing what needed to be done.

“This is what leadership looks like,” said White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.

“For years, Canada has supplied reasonably-priced steel to US factories while China has maintained a huge advantage over US companies in global trade. The President is simply doing what the Obama administration should have done long ago: punishing the nation most-likely to have our backs under any circumstances in order to make an adversary do what we want.”

Trade Wars Easy To Win

Although the President’s tariffs on steel will not affect the Chinese, since the US buys almost no steel from China, The President vowed he would not back down, and would increase the severity of his penalties against Canada if China did not comply.

“We will increase sanctions and tariffs on Canada over and over and over again until China gives the US what it wants in concessions,” the President said. “If the Chinese leaders think that Canada will somehow escape the consequences of China’s actions, it is sorely mistaken.”

In addition to tariffs on steel, the President promised to inflict dramatic penalties on Canadian imports of milk, timber, and precious metals into the US if China did not raise their prices on goods immediately.

And further, that even stronger measures will be taken against Canada if China did not force Kim Jong-Un to disarm his nuclear arsenal in time for the US midterm elections.

PYONGYANG, DPRK –

A sturdy old stadium that refused to yield to the march of time, or even explosives, may have a new foe to contend with.

Following the failed demolition of the long since abandoned Pontiac Silverdome by construction crews today, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, in a bellicose statement released to the press, has made a vow of vengeance on the empty facility to demonstrate to the world his awesome power and might.

Weakness Of America

The failure of the stadium to collapse following a private contractors’ detonation of a ring of explosives was proof, according to the reclusive leader, that the might of the US was waning.

“Obviously Donald Trump and the United States have become a third rate power,” said a statement from Pyongyang, “when they can not even tip over a decrepit stadium whose roof collapsed all by itself in 2013!”

“The DPRK will knock over this stadium like a toothpick balanced on the knee of our great leader, Kim Jong-Un!” the statement read. “And further, our fearless leader will field a football team all by himself that will decimate the Detroit Lions by many touchdowns!”

Other Threats Against The Motor City Issued

In addition to the threat against Pontiac Stadium, the press release went on to say that Kim Jong-Un will take on rapper Eminem in a rap battle and “destroy him with beats that are off the hook.” And further that he will “renovate a kitchen in record time which will be twice as good as anything Tim ‘Tool Man’ Taylor has done on all of his shows. And Kim Jong-Un will be twice as funny doing it!”

Despite the threatening nature of the press release, the statement did clarify that the DPRK will ensure that ex-Detroit Piston Dennis Rodman is not in the area when it pulverizes the Silverdome into a million pieces, since he was kind enough to visit Kim Jong-Un and provide him with a team-autographed poster of the 1989 Championship Team.

Beset by increasing monthly streaming subscription prices, stolen personal data, school-to-prison pipelines, runaway health care costs, and the endemic gerrymandering of its electoral power, the people of the United States have been searching for a champion of principled values to help them make sense of the confusing world around them.

And so the nation breathed a sigh of relief this week when the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association, currently in twelfth place in the Western Conference, stepped forward to guide them to an understanding of how to be a better human being.

Franchise Philosophy On Life Eagerly Awaited

“Finally, somebody who can give us a sense of ethical clarity in our lives,” said Raye Beecher who sells circus peanuts in a concession stand at the Kings’ arena. “We need someone to show us the way. And I look forward to the ownership group and players laying the foundation for how we can be better listeners as a people, and practice forgiveness while fighting for our dignity in this disconcerting world.”

Not Exactly Mohandas Ghandi

The Kings franchise, which has played in five different US cities over the course of a century, is one of the more storied NBA teams in the country.

“It’s true they were sponsored by a liquor company when they originated in New York as the Rochester Seagrams,” said sports reporter Damien Prytsky of the Sacramento Herald. “And they are in the bottom third of the league in terms of payroll, and struggle to make the playoffs each year.”

“But, as sports franchises go, they’re an elder statesman. So, that does carry a little more weight when they speak out.”

Not Calling People ‘Perv Sleazebags’

“And when you have a president who is calling people low class slobs, dummies, and worse every day on Twitter, at some point a sports team starts to look like a decent option as far as providing the average person a path to a richer understanding of the universe,” Mr. Prytsky added.

Rashid Borwood, who washes dishes in a Sacramento hotel, was willing to give them a chance. “These Kings seem like nice enough guys – so I’m inclined to listen to what they have to say.”

“I’m sure there’s a PR angle to it for the team, but really, if given the choice for someone to trust between the leaders in Washington, the evangelical preachers who turn a blind eye to what’s going on, cable TV pundits, Hollywood types, and the Kings? Well, that’s kind of a no-brainer if you ask me.”

Plans for a march on Washington to promote dignity, equality, and “The Freedom to Practice Three-dom” will be announced at a press conference following Friday’s game against the Cavaliers.

INDIANAPOLIS, IN –

After a year of dutifully meeting each month to discuss the latest New York Times best seller, a local book club has realized they are a lot more interested in drinking wine than reading, as evidenced by the multiple bottles they were consuming each night. So in an 11 to 0 vote, they decided to drop books altogether and now just go straight to drinking.

Don’t Really Like Each Other

“Honestly, we were really getting bogged down by the whole book thing,” said Denita Brittson. “I like to read, so I thought it would be fun to be in this group. But everyone was so obnoxious. Frank is super libertarian and is always twisting the book’s message to his point of view. Nancy just wants to talk about boys. And Calisha is always trying to make you feel like you don’t get what the book is about.”

“Then one night as we were polishing off our 5th bottle of Shiraz, we were trying to figure out who started the whole book idea. And it turns out it was someone who wasn’t even coming to the group any more,” said Ms. Brittson.

“Then Calisha said ‘well, why don’t we skip the books and just drink,’ and everyone laughed and then after a pause, Tom said, ‘I’d be down with that.”

A Revelation

“It turns out we were just there to drink,” said Frank Meemiter, who had joined the group in 2007. “It was really liberating to get that out on the table. And also how much we disliked hearing what each other had to say.”

‘Yeah, if I had to listen to Nancy say ‘I think what the author was trying to say’ one more time, I was going to blow my brains out,” said Ms. Brittson.

No More Blah Blah Blah, Just Delicious Wine

Tim Kernson, who had joined the group in 2007, was glad they won’t need to discuss the books any more. “As far as I’m concerned, reading is kind of a chore, and talking about reading is even worse,” he said. “I’d much rather have someone ask me what I thought of that last glass of Chardonnay, than some author who was boring me to tears.”

“Also, we have more time now to talk about what’s going on in our lives. Like when Jocelyn got a DUI last week after leaving wine club. Most of us have been thru that and had some great tips for her.”

More Time To Do Other Things

So far the decision seems to be a good one. When the group gathers, they usually head straight for the dining room where they stand around drinking glasses of wine in silence from the bottles that are on the table.

“We have little cards next to each bottle telling you where it came from and the vintage, but nobody reads them. We just pour,” said Mr. Kernson.

“I guess when you get right down to it, none of us are really big readers,” he said. “But boy, we can sure drink a glass of wine.”

It’s no secret that the airlines have been shrinking the size of passenger seats for years, but for one man, the result has proven disastrous.

Brian Middlehouse had just manage to wedge himself into his seat on a recent flight as the cabin crew began their final prep for takeoff, when he realized something had gone horribly wrong.

Kind Of Leaped Into It

“I’m what you would call a bigger guy,” said Mr. Middlehouse, speaking from inside an LCD monitor in row 14 of an Airbus A320. “Over the years it seemed like every time I flew on an airplane, my knees had less and less room. And then one flight, I realized they were literally pressed up against the seat in front of me, and it’s gotten worse every year since then.”

“So, I was prepared for squeezing into a tiny seat when I boarded that day. But the space was so small, I had to kind of take a deep breath and leap into it. It was after I came to a rest and went to reach for my seat belt that I knew something was terribly wrong.”

Couldn’t Reach The Call Button

Mr. Middlehouse’s entire body had been somehow been squeezed inside the video screen facing his seat, and he found himself suddenly staring out from a strange new world.

“I was looking directly at my empty seat on the airplane, which didn’t make any sense. So, I went to push the call button to alert the flight attendant, but my hands couldn’t reach any farther than the edge of the monitor. That’s when I really started freaking out.”

Life Inside A Monitor

“I started screaming of course, because nothing like that had ever happened to me. Then a flight attendant came over and explained that this happens occasionally on the newer planes and there was nothing to worry about. Well, that made me scream even louder, so she just turned down the volume on my monitor until I calmed down.”

Mr. MiddleHouse spent the next few weeks flying around in an airplane TV screen staring at the people who happened to be assigned to his seat. “It’s really depressing. Every day I am staring at multiple people who are A, very pissed off that they can’t watch “Game of Thrones” because I’m stuck on the screen. And B, super bummed about how small their seat is, and about flying in general.”

“As a guy trapped in an LCD screen, I’m practically suicidal anyway. But staring all day at the crazed eyes of people who are trapped in these tiny seats and would rather be anywhere else in the world than here – well, you get the picture.”

Unsure How Long It Will Last

Although the airline did not know how long the condition would last for Mr. Middlehouse, they did offer him a 5,000 mile frequent flyer bonus once he was free from the TV.

“I guess I’ll try to take advantage of that once I get out of here”, said Mr. Middlehouse as the plane pulled away from the gate on Thursday. “I mean, this has been the worst experience of my entire life, but I guess I could use the miles. So, you know, all things considered, it could be worse.”

LITTLE ITALY, NY –

Saying he was “most unhappy” with developments in the recent Russiagate investigation, and that “a man’s privacy must be respected always,” Don Vito Corleone expressed disappointment Tuesday over the seizure of attorney Michael Cohen’s records by the NY office of the FBI.

Mr. Corleone, a Sicilian-born immigrant and head of the alleged crime-syndicate Corleone family, believes the government over-stepped its bounds.

“When I arrived in this country, the communications between a client and his attorney were considered a sacred thing,” he told Make America The Best. “But now, the FBI comes into a man’s office and take all of his records without permission. It’s very disturbing.”

Respect For The Social Order

“A society needs laws,” said Don Corleone from the darkened parlor of his Long Island residence as his family celebrated the engagement of a nephew in the back yard. “A man must respect the moral code at all times. If not for these things, we would be just like animals.”

“It pains my heart to see a respectable man treated in this way by people who should be upholding the law. It is not right.”

A Family’s Honor

Mr. Cohen, who has compared himself in private to a mafia consigliere, reportedly made payments to a porn star and playboy model to keep them quiet about their affairs with President Trump.

“Of course, if this man has behaved in a disreputable fashion, and brought dishonor to his family, then action must be taken,” said the Don. “I would never stand in the way of justice being done when a family’s honor is at stake.”

Asked if he would consider making anyone involved in the investigation an offer they could not refuse, Don Corleone said he would never rush in to an unwise course of action.

However, representatives of the Corleone family have reportedly made inquiries at Belmont Park regarding several persons involved in the proceedings: in particular, whether anyone involved keeps a horse at the local stables, and at what time they generally turn in to bed to go to sleep.

WASHINGTON DC –

Saying that he has “no problems with the gays”, and claiming that he wasn’t targeting any specific group, President Donald Trump announced punishing new tariffs on the imports of glitter this afternoon after seeing several clips of Pride celebrations on Fox News.

“Believe me, I don’t care what people do behind closed doors or in closets, although if you ask me, some of the stuff these people do is offensive, but that’s their business. The point is – we cannot have these countries taking jobs away from Americans by dumping their glitter in our streets.”

“There must be 1000 pounds of glitter in some of these canons,” said the president, exasperated.

Military Parades Excluded From Tariffs

Although the new tariffs will increase the costs of glitter for celebrations across the country, the president did outline some exceptions to the 500% tariffs:

“If the military needs to buy glitter for a parade in Washington in front of the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, then that would be an exception based on national security.”

“Also, glitter for celebrations and rallies for the president would not be subject to the tariffs, for the same reason.”

Free To Buy From US Producers

“Despite the lack of patriotism these people display in buying glitter from the Chinese,” the president stated, “they would, of course, be free to buy their glitter from American companies.”

“However, whether American companies want to sell the glitter is up to them” he said, as the vice president and several evangelical leaders looked on during the press conference. “That’s a decision each company will need to make, which they can decide on religious grounds, since this is, of course, a free country.”

In response to the president’s announcement, organizers of several Pride festivals played a 2007 dance remix of Cher’s “Believe”, and turned up the volume to 11.

The US Treasury announced this week that a new currency called “America First Bucks” has been declared the official monetary unit of the United States of America by order of the President Donald Trump.

The president announced the new currency, which will be available in 1, 5, 15, 25 and 65 buck denominations, on the steps of the US Patent Office Building this morning.

New Currency Effective Immediately

Speaking under a large banner depicting an image of the new bill, President Trump declared the currency will be a tremendous success.

“The new America First Bucks will be bigger and better than the old dollar – in every way. People are going to be crazy for them,” the President said.

“I’ve spoken with President Xi of China, and he said he thinks America First Bucks look very impressive. All the world leaders I’ve shown them to said they will stimulate retail like you wouldn’t believe, and the American economy will be stronger than ever.”

Unconventional Rollout

The new bills are being introduced by hundreds of White House employees who have been dispatched to shopping mall parking lots across the country to exchange them for dollars.

“Sarah Sanders gave me 200 America First Bucks at the entrance to the mall,” said Tina Welchire of Albertville, Minnesota. “I went in to a store thinking that I could spend them just like dollars but the manager called the police when I tried to use them at the register.”

“They are a little bigger than the old bills, which makes them kind of stand out,” said Ms. Welchire. “Also, the ink came off on my hands, and it doesn’t seem to be washing off. But other than that, they seem fine.”

Financial Markets Thrown Into Turmoil

While banks around the world grappled with the news that trillions of US dollars now needed to be exchanged for America First Bucks, riots broke out on trading floors in New York, Hong Kong, Tokyo and London as investors desperately tried to dump equities in US companies.

“The price of gold has gone up 4,000 percent in the last 15 minutes,” said hedge fund manager Mort Somersgill of The Plutarch Fund. “Global wealth is at roughly 45% of what it was yesterday at this time. I just spoke to a banker in Europe who is advising clients to move all their assets to the Caymen islands immediately.”

Said a leading economic forecaster on Wall Street: “with the international banking system in complete free fall, a worldwide depression will be almost unavoidable at this point. We anticipate three to five years before the markets will recover, if ever, from this announcement by the administration.”

Discounts At Trump Hotel Properties

Meanwhile, the White House announced that guests who paid with America First Bucks at Trump properties will receive a discount off their bill.

“Trump Hotels and Resorts are among the best in the world,” said the president, “and to celebrate the release of America First Bucks, we are giving an unheard of 15% savings at all our properties.”

“We are also giving away these tiny replicas of the original Trump tower which is sure to be a collector’s item to the first ten people who spend 100 America First Bucks in our gift shops. America First Bucks will be the best currency ever in history.”

In response to questions from major news outlets around the world, the White House released a statement:

While a period of adjustment is to be expected with the introduction of a new currency, America First Bucks will be an important part of making the American economy great again. During the transition, US citizens are encouraged to use whichever bills make the most sense for them on a case by case basis.

NEW YORK, NY –

In the wake of controversy over a Superbowl ad for Dodge trucks that used a Martin Luther King Jr. speech as its soundtrack, Chevrolet decided this week against airing a new commercial for their Silverado line of pickups featuring the voice of Mahatma Gandhi exhorting the people of India to resist British Rule.

The advertisement, which featured footage of the leader of India’s drive for independence superimposed over the newest Silverado truck in a desert raised the ire of focus groups. People from India, in particular, complained vehemently of the insensitivity to their country’s national hero.

Ad Agency Admits It Was A Stretch

“Yeah, we liked the sound of his words, but I have to admit some of it didn’t make a lot of sense,” admitted Copywriter Bryan Bannigans. “Like the line ‘The power, when it comes, will belong to the people of India’. I guess we thought that showing covered wagons would kind of relate if you think about Native American Indians. But, looking back, it was definitely a reach.”

Another sore spot for Indians who viewed the commercial was the reference to owners of Chevy trucks as “outcasts”.

“The word ‘outcasts’ sounded cool the way Gandhi said it – kind of like Outkast from the hip hop group in the 1990s,” said the Art Director on the spot, Michael Pardenon. “But man did we catch an earful on that one from some people from New Dehli – apparently that was really insensitive and being an outcast in India is not cool at all.”

Carrying A Shot Gun

But of all the reactions to the commercial, the one that really stuck out for the advertising team was over the use of a body double placing a shot gun into the gun rack of one of the trucks as it drove past a dead deer.

“I actually got a little nervous for my safety when that scene came up. People sort of leapt out of their seats and suddenly started yelling,” said Mr. Bannigans. “There is a two-way mirror in the focus group rooms, and the participants can’t see you from the conference room. But there was one gentleman who I swear was staring right at me as he pounded on the window. I think that was when we decided we’d better pull the spot.”

Sticking With What You Know

Luckily, the ad agency had prepared some alternate scripts that centered around important figures from American history. “We’ve learned our lesson and will stick strictly with what we know from here on out,” said Mr. Bannigans.

“There was a great script with Malcolm X that the client really liked,” Mr. Pardenon said. “In one of his speeches he talks about ‘Instead of us airing our differences in public, we have to realize we’re all the same family. And when you have a family squabble, you don’t get out on the sidewalk. If you do, everybody calls you uncouth, unrefined, uncivilized, savage.’ We felt that really spoke to people needing a truck to drive around in. It’s pretty uplifting, at least the parts I’ve read of it.”

“Yeah, he was kind of a polarizing figure, but in a good way,” related Mr. Bannigans. “I’m about halfway thru the movie now, and it seems perfect for Silverado. We’ve even discussed trying to get Denzel Washington to play Malcolm X with the client – if we can’t get Malcolm to sign on. And there’s talk of licensing a Snoop Dogg track, too.”

Shooting of the replacement commercial will begin in Detroit next week outside the former Nation of Islam Temple Number One where Malcolm X was a minister, with a goal of hopefully getting to air during the winter Olympics.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA –

After a busy day of sight-seeing this week in the famous “City By The Bay,” college student and part-time barista Riley Kraner was reviewing the pictures he took on his smart phone while eating dinner, when he noticed something strange.

“I had gone through a guidebook the night before in my hotel room before I went to bed, and made a list of exactly what I wanted to see,” he said. “However, when I looked at the pictures I took today, I realized that a lot of the places I visited were not on my list at all. In fact, some of them appeared to be just random street corners.”

Seems Kind Of Fuzzy

As Mr. Kraner looked back on his day, he realized that some parts were hard to recall.

“I distinctly remember asking my phone for directions to Union Square, and I remember using the map function to walk down the hill from my hotel. I asked my phone to find a cafe, got a coffee, and walked around for a bit. Then I asked the phone for the nearest cable car to reach the wharf.”

“I remember walking a few blocks and getting on the cable car, but then, for some reason, I didn’t take it to the wharf like I planned.”

Exited Cable Car Near Shopping Mall

I remember hearing someone on a loudspeaker saying it was time to get off. Or at least I thought it was a loudspeaker. The next thing I knew I was in a store buying a screen protector and an insurance plan for my smart phone, which was not really planned as part of my day at all.”

Mr. Kraner continued on to Fisherman’s Wharf where he sampled a lobster roll and watched street performers doing some juggling.

“I knew from the guidebook there was a colony of Sea Lions that hang out near the Wharf, so I asked my phone for directions, but then I heard this loudspeaker again talking about a special on battery chargers. And then a map appeared on my screen showing me where the store was around the corner.”

Purchased Five Battery Chargers

I don’t remember going to that store, but later on as I was watching the Sea Lions I looked down at my hand and realized I had a bag in it with five phone chargers,” said Mr. Kraner.

“It was a little creepy, since I already had a perfectly good one back at the hotel. Although the ones in the bag were a lot more colorful.”

As he looked through the rest of his photos he had taken, Mr. Kraner became aware that he had visited a series of electronics stores and made purchases of more than $300 worth of phone accessories. “I don’t need any of this stuff,” he said. “I can’t imagine why I thought I should buy it.”

Looking Forward To Trip To Europe

Although a little unsure of what happened to him in San Francisco, Mr. Kraner was looking forward to a trip this summer to Europe and was planning to take his phone with him even though there will be roaming charges.

“I’ve been typing in the cities I want to visit in a list I keep on my phone. It’s hard to remember what I put in sometimes, because the cities keep changing. But I’m pretty sure it’s my list,” he said.

“And anyway, what am I gonna do? Go without a phone?” Mr. Kraner laughed. “I think I’ll be fine as long as I can just save up some extra money for phone accessories before I go.”

WASHINGTON, DC –

In a bit of sleuthing that would would have made Sherlock Holmes proud, the US Congress this week claimed to have located the source of most of the gravest problems facing the nation today: Steve Zuckerberg, the head of a social media company that provides free web pages for people to post pictures of themselves and share notes with each other.

Not The Obvious First Choice

“Many people would have picked another option when it came to identifying the main cause of what ails our country,” said Representative Frank Jordan, the chair of the House Industrial Energy Committee. “Endless war, runaway deficits, global warming, a backlog of government posts to fill, the crumbling of our infrastructure. There are a lot of things we could have chosen.”

“Gross income inequality, our students falling behind in education, earthquakes caused by fracking, the automation of manufacturing jobs, rampant gun availability in our streets, hate crimes, the proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons, racism. A lot of people would say these problems would be more important to focus on,” said Sarah Livers, Representative for Indiana’s 10th Congressional District.

But after considering many other possibilities as the origin for all that troubles its citizens, Congress zeroed in on one man.

Had No Idea What The Company Was Up To

Many in Congress were stunned to find that Mr. Zuckerberg’s company, Facebook, has provided information on its users continuously to advertisers since the company’s inception almost 15 years ago.

“It is shocking to the conscience that a free service would gather data on its users, then allow that information to be used by other companies to target advertising to those same users – essentially tailoring communication directly to an individual,” read a statement from the Congressional Office of Administration, which requested Mr. Zuckerberg come to Washington to respond to questions from all 535 of its members.

“Clearly, Mark Zuckerberg is either at the root, or is very close to the root, of almost all of the problems in our republic today,” it said.

Future Sessions To Be Scheduled

While the invitation to question Mr. Zuckerberg was extended to all past members of Congress, their wives, friends, children and grandchildren over 18, many were not able to make the trip.

“We plan on scheduling sessions throughout the coming months so that members who were unavailable the first two days can have their concerns addressed in a public forum,” the Office of Administration said. “And also to arrange access for local TV stations who were not able to film their home state Senators and Representatives asking questions the first time around.”

Remedies Congress is currently considering to rein in the social media giant are expected to include increased regulation, reduced pricing for political PACs to run ads, and access to mailing lists of all Facebook users broken down by party affiliation and whether or not they are fans of cats.

Additional appearances of Mr. Zuckerberg before Congress are expected to run thru the 2018 midterm elections.

NEW YORK, NY –

Thinking he was joining a tour group embarking on a fun-filled 13-day vacation excursion to Eastern Europe, Paul Manafort expressed surprise on Tuesday when told he was actually among a group of Russian diplomats at JFK International airport who were on their way back to Moscow after being expelled from the country.

Mr. Manafort, no longer wearing the electronic bracelets to track his movements which were later found sawed off in his kitchen, expressed surprise that the people next to him were all employees of the Russian embassy.

“You’ve got to be kidding!” said Mr. Manafort. “This is not the Explore Eastern Europe vacation package? Wow. I was sure the flight was today. I must have misread my emails!”

13 Nights Accommodations In Memorable, Centrally Located Hotels

The tour, which Mr. Manafort insisted was leaving from somewhere in the terminal later that afternoon, promised a fabulous excursion of several European capitals, including a day at leisure to relax in the cafes of Warsaw, and shopping in the bustling markets of Prague’s fascinating Jewish Quarter.

“I was very much looking forward to the fascinating history, art, and culture of Eastern Europe coming alive for me – not to mention celebrating with my fellow travelers at a festive dinner in Gdansk. But – it looks like I got things a little mixed up. How embarrassing!”

Must Be Leaving On A Different Date

“What a coincidence that all these Russians were gathered together here,” he said as several nearby embassy employees pretended not to see him. “I was wondering why there was no one holding a sign up for Das Vadanya Tours. It all makes sense now.”

“Well, I guess I’ll be heading back home then,” he said to authorities as they took him by both arms and led him to a detention facility.”I sure hope the travel company allow me to re-book the trip soon. I’d really hate to forfeit that $300 deposit!”

MENLO PARK, CA –

Outlining a bright future ahead during an impromptu meeting of the 7th floor staff this week, co-worker Steve got the sales team excited when he announced Casual Fridays would be a permanent perk for all employees in the operations division.

Cheering broke out as the staff high-fived and celebrated the popular free pass from the office dress code.

Exactly Why We Murdered Old Boss

“This is precisely why we all got together to murder the old boss this week,” said Pat Solanges who works in human resources. “He wanted work-driven robots, and thought letting us wear jeans to work once a week would get in the way of performance.”

“I don’t want to say we strangled him with a Cat-6 Ethernet cable during our Tuesday status just because of Casual Fridays,” he said. “But it definitely figured into the decision-making process.”

Carleesha Simpson, who is an Accounts Receivable Team Leader, agreed Casual Fridays came into play. “It makes the week more enjoyable. You get dressed up everyday knowing that there’s this day at the end of the week where you can just relax. It lets you be you.”

“Did the promise of Casual Fridays cause me to apply my knee to my bosses neck as my co-workers dragged him to the floor?” she asked. “No. But it sure made it easier to do so.”

More Perks Coming Now That Boss Is Dead

Other benefits announced by Co-Worker Steve at the meeting included a Whole Foods Discount Card, Netflix membership for the office, and a company account for the team at the Starbucks on the corner.

“Steve is suggesting a lot of the things that we’ve always wanted for the office and everyone is really excited,” said Mr. Solanges. “If we had known killing the boss was all it took to have a great place to come to work everyday, we probably would have done this a long time ago.”

Disposal Of The Body

After the team celebrated the Casual Friday’s announcement, it was time to address what they were going to do with their boss’s body.

“Normally the boss would lead this type of discussion – typically because he had some weirdly specific way he wanted things done, which we had to keep guessing at until he told us what to do,” said Ms. Simpson. “But now, we just kind of go around the room and people throw out ideas. It’s not very efficient, but for the first time there’s a sense of togetherness.”

“Especially since we can all face 15 to 20 years in prison or worse if someone finds out about the murder.”

After an open discussion, the staff decided to send the body down the trash shoot into the incinerator. “It was really a team decision, which was nice,” said Martin Gilwater, Senior Manager. “A couple people wanted to carve the body into pieces and transport it out of the office in gym workout bags. But Steve pointed out that we could be stopped by security, and that burning the body would eliminate any trace of the boss.”

“He made a lot of sense, and everyone agreed that was the best plan.”

Steve To Be The Next Boss?

Although receiving a generally positive reception for his ideas, some co-workers expressed concern that Steve was setting himself up as the next boss. “I like what Steve is saying, but the old boss used to say some of the same things,” said Mr. Gilwater. “Still, I’m willing to give him a shot.”

Mr. Solange, however, wasn’t taking any chances. “We’re keeping the Ethernet cable handy in Carleesha’s credenza – just in case. I am finally working at a place with Casual Fridays.” he said. “It’s been a dream of mine for years. And no matter what happens, I am never going back.”

“Even if I have to kill a hundred Steves.”

MONTCLAIR, KY –

Like the couple in the 1979 pop song “Escape,” who answer the same personals ad and find out they were both trying to cheat on each other, Mary Beth Tisdole and Martin Grossbeek shared a good laugh this week after discovering each other’s fake profiles on the dating site Tinder.

“I think it’s so funny that we were both trying to cheat at the same time!” said Ms. Tisdole, as she read thru her husband’s extensive profile. “And I never realized we had so much in common.”

“Who knew I was married to someone that had no interest in being with me whatsoever,” Mr. Grossbeek chuckled. “And was also a fellow white supremacist. What a coincidence!”

Closet Nazi Memorabilia Fan

The couple ran across each other’s profiles while swiping thru potential hook ups last Saturday, and found out a lot about each other that they didn’t know.

“I told Martin I had a headache and went upstairs, and apparently he was doing the same thing in the garage – so funny,” said Mrs. Tisdale.

“There were some OK pics,” said Mr. Grossbeek, “but all of a sudden I swiped and there was a picture of Mary Beth holding a bloody crucifix standing in front of a satanic symbol,” said Mr. Grossbeek. “My first thought was, wow, that’s pretty cool. Then, when I read that she was looking for someone who shared a deep abiding passion for The Fuhrer, I was like – wow, I’m so turned on!”

Harp Seal Taxidermy

Apparently the couple shared a lot more than a queen bed in a 2-story duplex.

“I’ve been into the occult since high school, but I was never comfortable sharing it with guys I was dating. And when I fell in love with Martin, I really didn’t want him to find out,” said Ms. Tisdole. Ironically, Mr. Grossbeek was thinking the same thing. “Sacrificing goats to please the dark lord is not something that girls go in for. Or at least, I never thought they did, until now!”

“I’m still not sure why Martin claimed to have someone cryogenically frozen in his garage. But then again, I guess I’m not really sure what all he keeps out back, so who knows?!” she laughed.

Among other things the couple revealed on Tinder: they both enjoy carvings made from the ivory of endangered species, go out of their way to create greenhouse gases, and they also both like Justin Bieber. “I guess the Justin Bieber thing is not really that unusual. But it’s kind of nice we don’t have to pretend to like reggae any more.”

Confession To Murder

Although unusual to find in a Tinder profile, Mr. Grossbeek also confessed to being present at the death of a friend in college during a botched plan to burglarize a genetic engineering lab. “The crime was never reported to the authorities due to the highly illegal nature of the experiments being done there, but I have to say it felt great to get that off my chest.”

For her part, Ms. Tisdole was just glad to find someone who also liked to drink gasoline. “I’m not much for Pina Coladas or getting caught in the rain, but if I had known Martin was up for getting blackout drunk on Sterno, I wouldn’t have bothered with Tinder.”

Although the couple is looking forward to a more open relationship, several friends expressed disappointment that the couple wasn’t breaking up, since they won’t get to see the juicy revenge porn they were sure would have been posted.

Chafing under years of scientific reporting on the catastrophic effects that cigarette smoking has on human health, President Trump today announced that “contrary to what fake news would have you believe, cigarettes are definitely not bad for your health. In fact, they are actually very good for you.”

Smoking his way thru the press conference to demonstrate that cigarettes are not harmful, President Trump railed against the “phony science and lying media” that identified cigarette smoking as the nation’s number one killer.

“How bad can they be?” said Mr. Trump us he lit up a KOOL menthol 100. “Isn’t tobacco just a plant? A lot of people eat vegetables – they don’t get lung cancer. And how about candles? We burn them all the time. Why isn’t someone doing a study on them?”

Took Up Smoking Last Week

The President, who is not known as a smoker, said he started smoking recently after seeing a news report on CNN about the number of deaths in the US each year caused by tobacco use.

“Phony CNN claimed that over 400,000 people die each year in this country from smoking. If that were true, wouldn’t we see dead people everywhere? Where are they? There should be hearses driving all over the city if there were that many people dying. Fake news!”

Tobacco Companies Agree Smoking Is Bad For You

Although all major tobacco companies have admitted cigarette smoking is hazardous to your health, and run advertising alerting the general public that it kills 1,200 people each day, the President remained unconvinced.

“I know lots of people who smoked all the time thru the 70’s and 80’s. You know what? Most of them are still alive,” said the President. “Sure, some have died from lung cancer and other things, but did you know you can get lung cancer from a toilet seat? You won’t hear that from the fake news outlets, but it’s true.”

Cancer From Toilet Seats

While the President did not explain how cancer could be transmitted from toilet seats to humans, he may be referring to a message received on his twitter account from “@1776_Guy” claiming that MSNBC was suppressing a story about the subject.







When reached for comment, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated: “you heard what the President said. If MSNBC is sitting on a story about the real cause of cancer coming from toilet seats, that is something that you should take up with them.”

Precautionary Measures

When reached via a phone line reserved for national health emergencies, the Surgeon General explained to the President that it’s not possible to contract cancer from a bathroom. However, as a precautionary measure, all toilet seats will be replaced in the West Wing on the President’s orders. Also, a separate bathroom will be installed for use by Melania in the first family’s private residence, effective immediately.

VOLGOGRAD, RUSSIA –

An army of Russian Bots, responsible for wreaking havoc on elections and fomenting discord around the globe, has announced a new fragrance line this week for men and women.

The new scent, called Smelnik, immediately garnered 1.3 million likes on Twitter and Facebook upon its announcement, and was trending heavily across all social media platforms.

Like And Retweet This Fragrance

A press release by the Russian Bots outlined their strategy for capturing consumer attention in the crowded fragrance and perfume category by asking people to “Like and RT this fragrance”. An aggressive social media campaign was picked up by hundreds of thousands of Twitter and Facebook users that liked the new fragrance and also asked other users to like and retweet.

Fragrance Events Planned

In an effort to drive sales for the new perfume, Russian Bots also announced a series of rallies across the U.S.

“Rally today in support of Smelnik in Union Square at 3:30pm” announced one event planned for San Francisco, asking citizens to “defend against deep state perfumes Chanel and Armani”

Other Smelnik events were scheduled for Manhattan’s Upper West Side, Miami, and Beverly Hills.

Immediately Bashed

The new fragrance was immediately attacked by tens of thousands of Twitter and Facebook users who claimed the new fragrance was a “Hillary conspiracy” and the work of Mongolian terrorists linked to ex-Senator Al Franken. Users were asked to get the word out about Smelnik and its ties to Democrats and their allies.

Estimates for U.S. sales of Smelnik, which is an extract of cod liver oil, were not available at press time. However, industry analysts are predicting they will top 1.8 million by Q3 of 2018.

UNITED STATES –

Across the country this week, referees, umpires, line judges and other sporting officials on the take expressed their extreme gratitude for the Supreme Court’s landmark decision to legalize sports gambling.

“Jackpot!”, said Olaf Jorgenson, who asked that we use a fictitious name out of fear of being fired from his job officiating college football games. “Christmas is coming early this year, and baby needs a new pair of gold plated shoes!”

In bars around the nation, unscrupulous sports officials rejoiced at the ruling. “Usually I get asked to fix maybe 1 or 2 games a year,” said umpire Ned Wurlitzer, who also asked that we use a different name. “But there’s gonna be a whole lot more fish in the sea now thanks to this ruling.”

“And I’m not going to have to do it for peanuts any more. As they say, the price of tea in China just went up. Thank you, Justice Alito!”

Real Moneyball

While the Supreme Court did not make bribing sports officials legal, it did give states the right to legalize sports betting, which will result in millions of people having a financial interest in the outcome of games who did not have one before.

“Let’s see,” said a hockey referee in a state that is planning to allow sports gambling, “10,000 people are placing a bet on a game that I am refereeing. And I can hand out penalties to anyone on the ice and no one can question me? Ladies and Gentlemen, call the Coast Guard because my ship has come in!”

No Longer Dependent On Mafia

Gone are the days when sports betting took place in the shadows, as everyday Americans are now free to put money down on their local teams.

“In the past, it used to bother me that the games I was fixing were always benefiting the mob. But now, I can be a lot more choosy about who I fix games for,” said a well-known soccer official. “My doctor. The neighbor down the block. The head of the local PTA. If they’ve got the cash, I can help them out.”

While local crime syndicates did not comment specifically on the Supreme Court ruling, they released a statement saying that they were proud to be doing business in such a great country, and they were looking forward to the many great federal judicial appointments that the current administration will be making in the coming years.

Vowing to mete out punishment to those responsible for what he called “a pestilence for the ages,” Jesus returned to the earth Monday to smite the editorial board, writers and support staff of satirical news source “The Onion”.

Displaying a fury normally associated with the Old Testament, the usually peaceful Jesus was in no mood to make amends with a media company that has mocked him repeatedly over the years.

“Today the wicked will feel the wrath of God my father, and all the archangels who have been so sorely abused by this blasphemous buffoonery,” said Jesus.

Workers Question Timing Of Attack

Although not a complete surprise to the Onion staff, many employees thought it was unfair of Jesus to single them out.

“Obviously there are a lot of parties he could have smote first,” said copywriter Andrew Weinschmuller as he hurriedly loaded provisions into the trunk of his Ford Taurus in the Onion parking lot. “There’s ISIS, of course. And the companies polluting the earth. And dictators around the globe -” he said, pausing as a lightning bolt whistled over his head and exploded his car’s antenna.

“For Christ’s sake, I just bought this!” Mr. Weinschmuller yelled.

A Long Litany Of Affronts

While there have been many stories that incurred his ire, the Lord cited “New Evidence Reveals Christ Lounged In Tomb For Extra Hour Before Finally Rising From Grave” and “Time Capsule Discovered In Rear End Of Jesus Statue,” as being particularly egregious.

“As Lord of the Universe, I possess a perfect sense of humor,” said Jesus as he vaporized a Xerox machine in the company break room. “But these Philistines are even less funny now than when they began filling the world with their filth.”

“I am doing creation a favor by smiting them.”



Will Also Smite Click Hole

Promising to annihilate the “fabricators of untruths” at the flagship Onion first, Jesus said he would also obliterate the writers of Click Hole “and the many other sundry profaners against God and nature in the various subsidiaries of this heinous abomination”.

The editorial staff, unreachable in their underground lair located a mile beneath the city of Madison, Wisconsin, had no comment. However, a spokesperson referred callers to the company homepage where a list of “Top 10 Jams Jesus Listens To When He’s Stoned” was posted.

UNITED STATES –

The year 2016 is mostly remembered for the historic US presidential election. But there was another front page news story that has been all but forgotten, and unfortunately, so have its many characters that once made news around the world.

Groundbreaking, Then Heart-Breaking

Pokèmon Go provided a good living to millions of animated characters who spread themselves throughout the US to entertain and delight children, and adults who were young at heart, as they played the breakthrough augmented reality game.

At first, the need for animated characters to work the long hours required to fill neighborhood after neighborhood across the country with exciting play was a bonanza for qualified Pokèmon:

“You could work as much as you wanted in those early days,” said Jigglypuff, who has been sleeping recently in the aqueducts of Los Angeles. ” I had a nice car, took vacations when I wanted. It was pretty easy money and best of all, it brought a lot of joy to the kids.”

The game, downloadable as an app on your smart phone, was eventually played by more than 230 million people.

But then, in 2017, the bottom fell out.

The novelty of the game started to wear off. “No one was playing anymore and they started cutting Pokèmon. First by the hundreds. Then the thousands,” said Jigglypuff.

“You couldn’t get a job anywhere. I went from working double shifts, to every other day, and then next thing you know your contract would be up and you’d have to move on to the next town.”

Making Ends Meet In Video Arcades

For many Pokèmon, the transition from Pokèmon Go to other video games proved daunting.

“The typical Pokèmon character is very cute,” said Professor Sonny Wilbrandt, Chair of the Animation Department at The University of Santa Clarido, New Mexico. “But the proliferation of first person shooter games has made it hard for them to find work.”

“Lovable, animated creatures in primary colors are just not in demand in this era where most players want to unwind after work shooting zombies in the head with a 12-gage.”

Due to the lack of opportunity, Pokèmon Go characters have been forced to get by with odd jobs in pinball machines, vintage 1970s Atari consoles, and kid-themed restaurants.

“Used to be I wouldn’t set foot in a Chuck E. Cheese,” said Squirtle, one of the original 150 Pokèmon characters. “Now, I’d kill for a chance to work on one of their screens. It’s gotten to where I’ll take just about anything.”

KooblaTube

Many people are unfortunately very familiar with the double-kidnapping and subsequent shootout with police involving KooblaTube, a minor Pokèmon character who wasn’t able to handle the stress of life on the streets.

“KooblaTube is a prime example of what can happen to an otherwise perfectly harmless animated character that is unable to cope when placed under extreme duress,” said Psychologist Manuel Sangrino.



Taking two people hostage after fleeing the scene of a stabbing in a Reno bar, the ex-Pokèmon character charged officers yelling that his arms were stronger than their guns, and was shot by police.

“The fall from popularity can be especially hard on vulnerable animated personalities,” said Dr, Sangrino. “And when you add drug abuse, easy access to weapons, and an unlocked car with the keys in the ignition, the outcome can be downright tragic.”

Heading Back To Japan?

For Jigglypuff, the long road has made him rethink his priorities.

“Like most of the characters, I’m originally from Japan and immigrated here for work when the game took off. It was a lot of fun back then – made a lot of friends, went to a lot of parties. But now, I’m thinking, maybe it’s time to leave.”

“Anime provides a decent living, and while it’s not as glamorous as working in America, at least you don’t have to worry about where your next meal is coming from. Besides, a lot of the same people who used to love us now talk about how foreigners are really messing up their country. They don’t say you’re part of the problem, but you get their drift.”

“Judging by the direction things are headed around here,” Jigglypuff said as he watched some people approaching from a nearby alley, “I think it’s about time for this Pokèmon to Go – back home.”

UNITED STATES –

Rising from their beds with nowhere else to go, and no prospects of relief in sight, Americans across the country staggered this morning into the oncoming headlights of yet another blitzkrieg of daily news.

“For the love of God, make it stop,” said Alfred Tennysol, a UX developer for a hotel chain based outside of Des Moines, IA. “I’d blow my brains out, but that would just give them another story to run. I can’t take much more of this,” he said.

Relentless Torrent Continues

As cable newscasters resumed the unremitting flow of live updates, opinions, counter-opinions, and background stories that make up the twenty-four hour news cycle, people scrambled for cover anywhere they could find it.

“I just read the backs of cereal boxes over and over and over,” said Jean Newhamian of Fountain, Colorado. “I think it’s doing something bad to my brain, but I don’t care. I just can’t look any more.”

Ty Corrumba of Juniper, Montana, said he had taken to humming in the morning. “I hum and whistle without tune. And drink a lot. Whiskey mostly. Anything to avoid turning on the TV and hearing about the next makeover tip, school shooting, doomsday device, or water-skiing squirrel.”

“Yesterday, as I was driving into town, a guy on the radio started talking about another sex scandal involving a prominent politician and I just about drove into an oncoming garbage truck. It’s getting real bad.”

Like Being Run Over By A Train Every Morning

Although the dizzying barrage of news images, texts, articles, streaming podcasts and videos long ago outstripped the average person’s ability to absorb what was happening, the remorseless onslaught of timely information showed no signs of abating.

“The news networks say they are helping me to lead an informed life,” continued Mr. Corrumba. “Well, I got news for them: my life is being informed to death.”

“I don’t want any more context,” said Weehawken New Jersey elementary school administrator Delores Jones, yelling at her TV from across the kitchen. “Do you hear me? No! More! Context!”

This Just In

As the nation struggled to process the latest revelations, another breaking development that interrupted the four previous news flashes, twelve healthful foods you should know about, and cute puppy you do not want to miss, advised viewers to stay tuned as there was more to follow on this very important upcoming story.

Which was scheduled to resume right after this commercial break.

WASHINGTON DC –

Saying they always knew the president wouldn’t let them down, believers in the supremacy of the Aryan race were glad to hear Trump’s lawyers affirm in the Supreme Court that all Israelis could legally be barred from coming to the US.

“This is simply confirmation of something we have always believed: that the Founding Fathers wanted only white Anglo-Saxon Protestants to live in this country,” said Aryan Mike, Supreme Leader of God’s Army of White Soldiers. “We hope Congress will move swiftly to enact this law, now that the Trump administration has declared it legal.”

Solicitor General Says It’s Legal

In his argument on behalf of the president’s immigration ban on five predominantly Muslim countries before the Supreme Court Tuesday, Solicitor General Noel Francisco asserted that it would also be legal to ban all Israelis from immigrating to the US if it were a matter of national security.

“If his cabinet were to say to him, ‘Mr. President, there is honestly a national security risk here and you have to act,’ I think then that the president would be allowed to follow that advice,” Mr. Francisco told the Justices.

Anti-Semitic Groups Say Israelis Definitely Security Threat

“This is exactly why we voted for this president,” said Aryan Mike.

“It’s obvious to anyone who pays attention that there is a mass immigration of Islamic terrorists infiltrating into the US by disguising themselves as Israelis,” said Aryan Mike. “It’s vital to our national security that the administration move to ban Israelis immediately now that it’s been declared legal.”

Israelis Question Ban

“I always believed the United States was a land of opportunity, and that President Trump was our friend,” said Yashim Dirigible, of the Bora Telmuk Settlement on the West Bank. “Why are they discussing a ban on Israelis in the Supreme Court? It’s wrong to ban people because of their religion.”

“God would never permit any such law from happening,” said Rabbi Yitzak Whelpim of Tel Aviv. “If the US were to ban Israelis, He would smite them with a plague. Or at least decrease the speed of their internet connections.”

Stephen Miller Unavailable For Comment

Although reportedly the architect of the president’s immigration ban, Trump Advisor Stephen Miller, who was raised by Jewish parents in Santa Monica, did not make a comment on the Solicitor General’s assertion in the Supreme Court.

However, a Republican strategist seen leaving the White House said that the administration would never institute a ban on Israelis, saying they are a valued security partner in the volatile region of the Middle East.

“Besides,” he said, “I couldn’t never support a ban on Israelis – some of my best friends are Jews.”

In a big change from what used to be a fairly routine task, Americans are having to put in more and more effort these days to pretend that they don’t see the thousands of UFOs that fill the skies both day and night across the country.

In fact, for many Americans, the ubiquitous space craft from other planets are becoming almost impossible to avoid.

Getting Pretty Ridiculous

Once the stuff of legend, UFOs were the purview of crackpots and fringe societies throughout the 1970s. But the massive uptick in the sheer numbers of them has made it difficult for Americans to look the other way.

“Back in the day, it used to be you might run into one here or there, like over a corn field or flying above some mountains,” said Ike Nollingsworth of Butte, Montana. “And it was always the middle of the night. Now it’s getting like you can’t go outside without having to turn your head or stare at the ground. They are literally everywhere.”

Can’t Even Look In Rear View Mirror

Jamie Willmens of Central City, Texas, says he is followed by UFOs every time he drives into town. “It’s starting to be a safety concern,” he said. “They are always in my rear view mirror, especially at train crossings.”

“At some point, you just have to watch where you’re going. If a UFO is flying right over the road in front of me, there’s not a lot I can do about it.”

Wondering If We Should Just Admit They Are Here

In fact, some Americans are wondering if we should just stop pretending and admit that aliens are everywhere.

“Really, who are we trying to fool anyway?”, said Shirley Jattson of Cornell, Georgia. “It’s not like they can’t see us trying to avoid them. They know that we see them. So why not just acknowledge them?”

“I agree,” said her husband Jack. “Let’s just admit it and get on with our lives.”

No Comment From The Pentagon

Although average Americans are coming to grips with accepting that aliens may exist, so far the US government has been slow to respond. A recent press release from the Department of Defense read:

“While there has been an increase in reports of unidentified objects in the sky over the past few years, Americans should continue to go about their business as they have always done.” “Whether or not aliens exist and are flying around continuously in our aerospace is a possibility that the US government is investigating, and we will share our findings at an appropriate time. Most likely during a full scale alien invasion to take over the planet.”

WASHINGTON DC –

Two US Senators declared themselves ready to take on the best memories on earth today, stating their intention to recite the irrational number known as “Pi” to over 100,000 decimal places.

Convinced they can break the current Guinness World Record held by Lu Chao of China, who in 2005 recited Pi to 67,890 digits, Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas, and David Perdue of Georgia, have scheduled a public event to try and claim the coveted prize.

Couldn’t Remember Meeting They Were In Several Hours Ago

Although the Senators, who were present for a White House meeting on immigration when the President reportedly referred to countries as “shitholes”, were unable to recall anything out of the ordinary a few hours later, they are confident they can memorize the number Pi well beyond the current record.

“The key to memorizing an arbitrary number is to turn the digits into a story,” said Senator Cotton. “Despite not remembering a sitting President using the language of a drunken sailor earlier today, we feel confident that using these advanced memorization techniques, we will remember more of the number Pi than any humans in history.”

Need To Consult Staff

Although neither Senator could remember the date they had arranged to try and break the record, they were pretty sure that the month started with the letter J, or maybe M, and would take place most likely on a weekend, since they are supposed to be at work during the week. Also, the event would be held either in Washington DC, or in the state of Washington, or at Washington’s Home in Mount Vernon. Details to follow.

LOS ANGELES, CA –

In another twist in the LeeAnn Tweeden saga, it was revealed Tuesday that when she posed for a photo spread in 2011, Playboy Magazine had assured the model that it was OK to take off her clothes, since the special camera they were using had an “anti-nudity” function that would not show any private areas of the human body.



Camera Malfunction

“Obviously she was devastated when the pictures came out and she realized the camera had malfunctioned,” said her publicist at the time, Cheryl Daryl. “She called Playboy and they said that they were also very distraught, but there was nothing that could be done since the camera sends pictures directly to the printer and the issues were already printed.



Wool Jumpsuits Were All The Rage

It was reportedly very hot in the room where they were taking the photographs, which is why Ms. Tweeden asked if she could take off her wool jumpsuit. “Wool jumpsuits were very fashionable in the fall of 2011, but they were really scratchy and hot. So, when the photographer said they had the special anti-nudity camera, it was a great relief to LeeAnn. Of course, in hindsight, she never would have gotten naked if she knew the camera was broken.”



Legal Action Considered

“LeeAnn called her attorney and asked if they could sue the camera-maker for the malfunction, but the attorney said they would need to know the manufacturer’s name which LeeAnn did not have,” said Ms. Daryl.

“And when she called Playboy, they said they had misplaced the camera and couldn’t remember what the name of it was. So, needless to say, she was very unhappy about the whole situation.”



Lesson Learned

“I guess it just goes to show you that you need to have someone inspect the camera closely before doing a photo-shoot to make sure that the anti-nudity function is in working order,” said Ms. Daryl. “I make sure and tell all my clients to ask that question now, so hopefully we can prevent this kind of nudity from ever happening again in the future.”

SAN DIEGO, CA –

A twelve-year-old lion that possesses the power to see into the future was horrified this week at the San Diego Zoo when he was suddenly seized by a vivid apparition of you, spanking the proverbial monkey, next Saturday in a teal bathroom with pink shower curtains.

Buffing The Banana

The lion, known to staff and visitors as “Leonidas”, was passing the time peering into immortal destiny, when his eyes happened across your figure by the Dippin’ Dots stand near the entrance to Panda Canyon.

It was during that moment, as you fiddled with your sunglasses, that your future became known to him in a vision: namely, that you would fish with your zipper trout at a co-worker’s brunch in four days time, a sight he immediately regretted ever having seen.

Arguing With Henry Longfellow

Standing in the hot sun, you became aware the lion was staring at you.

“What is up with that lion?” you wondered, as you reached into your backpack for a Sprite while he gazed at you intently. “He has such a weird look.”

In fact, although it would be several days before you arrive at the home of Margaret from accounting, the lion was busy suppressing his gag reflex as he beheld the sight of you, shaking hands with Abe Lincoln, while your co-workers celebrated Margaret’s birthday downstairs.

And for unknown reasons, as you looked back at the King of Beasts, you felt a little bit embarrassed.

Adjusting The Antenna

But like the paragon of virtue he is, majestic, resplendent in his strength, Leonidas the lion will not judge you for taking yourself to the self-service station while another brunch guest waited outside for you to finish your business.

Still, if he had one wish, the Lord of all the Earth’s animals would ask that you stay home next week when your friends return to the zoo.

Because frankly, he would prefer not to see you test-firing your meat missile ever again. Especially since you won’t even bother washing your hands when you are done at Margaret’s.

For Christ’s sake.

331,331,2018-02-15 00:00:00+00:00,"CAIRO, EGYPT –

State of the art imaging tools used to scan subterranean passages in the Sinai Peninsula yielded an amazing discovery last month as a team of scientists uncovered what appears to be several hieroglyphics depicting actor, director and producer Danny DeVito.

The Ancient Court Of Padyspub II

The stone carvings, part of the tomb of Pharaoh Padyspub II, who ruled briefly during the 3rd century BC, gave archeologists a glimpse into a little known period when humor was in ascendance in the Egyptian court.

“Although the appearance of the figure of Danny Devito in the scenes is a mystery, we can see from the inscriptions that he was a humorous character, full of pranks,” said Alton Montavier, Professor at the British Royals Museum.

“For instance, on one panel, located across from the Pharaoh’s sarcophagus, he is shown playing the common Egyptian trick ‘smell my water lilly”.

In the carving, water can be seen spraying over the face of the Pharaoh who is smiling.

“Typically an Egyptian would have been put to death immediately after such an act,” said Professor Montavier. “So, clearly, we can see the Danny DeVito figure had special privileges in the society.”

Precursor To Ancient God Bes

Pharaoh Padyspub II was an eccentric ruler who enjoyed laughing, and made frequent offerings to the Egyptian god Bes, a god associated with sexuality, humour, and often pictured as a fat bearded dwarf.

“There is definitely a resemblance between Bes and the Danny DeVito figure,” said Egyptologist Ludi Palma, who headed up the excavation. “It’s possible that he was an early expression of the god in Egypt during this period. We see in his depiction many of the humorous traits later associated with Bes: pronounced bow legs, shaking a rattle, and sticking out his tongue.”

Food Memes Also Discovered

Another interesting finding in the tomb was the use of early food memes by the Egyptians. “Food memes have been found in many cultures, but never before have we seen such an early example.”

“The first known food meme was of an image of the face of King Henry The Eighth on a plate of haggis, woven into a 16th century tapestry,” said Professor Palma.

“But here we have the head of Danny DeVito being served along with more extravagant fare fit for a Pharaoh. This seems to indicate that Danny DeVito, if consumed, would bring the Pharaoh good health or special powers.”

Research Continues

While Egyptologists have much work to do to answer the question of why Danny DeVito was found in the ancient etchings, some theories have been proposed.

“The most likely explanation is that present-day Danny DeVito is descended from the figure we see in the carvings. His ancestors could have migrated to Europe from Egypt during the corn famine of the 2nd century. This would explain the striking physical resemblance, and Danny DeVito’s knack for comedy.”

“However, it’s also possible that the figure was a member of a race of extremely funny aliens who happened to visit the planet during the reign of Padyspub II. In this theory, modern-day Danny DeVito would be an alien that crash-landed somewhere in New Jersey during the 1970s, and fell into acting as a means to support himself in New York.”

“Both theories are valid at this point,” said Professor Palma. “But personally, I’m pulling for alien. It just seems to make more sense.”

ASTORIA, NY –

Leonard Doliver, of Astoria, Queens in New York City, has been a diehard fan of East Coast Rap ever since he can remember.

“It started back in ’95 when I was three years old. Some cousins came over for Christmas and they were listening to Illmatic in my older brother’s room. There was something so amazing about those beats – they really spoke to me. I’ve been a fan of hip hop ever since.”

Favor For A Girlfriend

But a recent request from his girlfriend exposed Mr. Doliver to some music he might not otherwise have listened to.

“Normally I’m listening to Travi$ Scott, Meek Mill, Kendrick or Nasty Nas. But my girlfriend needed to put together a mix of the Bee Gees for her dad’s 60th birthday party and she asked me if I could do it. I had heard of them, but wasn’t really familiar – but I was like, OK whatever, I could put something together for you.”

Mad Sounds

However, after listening to a few albums, Mr Doliver realized that the Bee Gees were more than they appeared at first.

“You know, I have to say those Bee Gees were straight up ballers. I started listening to their early stuff and I was like, OK, not for me but I see why people liked it. But then as I got into it, I was like, woah, these are actually some pretty sick rhythms.”

“They had these players like Blue Weaver threading killer synth lines that kind of blew me away. And I’m not talking about just the Saturday Night Fever tracks, which were monsters. But their later stuff is not appreciated like it should be.”

Killing It For Decades

Mr. Doliver was also impressed with how long the group stayed active. “They were just kids when they started that string of hits in the 60’s with their love songs. Then to come back later and be such a formative influence on disco. Six #1 singles in the US within a year and a half which tied the Beatles. 220 million records sold. Plus the all the songs they wrote and produced for other artists.”

“And the whole time, they were totally doing their own thing – you instantly know a Bee Gees song when you hear it. The falsetto harmonies are one of a kind.”

“In my opinion, they were the complete package.”

G.O.A.T?

As much as Mr. Doliver enjoyed spinning Bee Gees classics, he won’t be retiring any of his favorite music any time soon. “I can’t say that I’m going to be listening to their stuff over and over. I’m still a Hip Hop guy.”

“But I might have to pick up up a Saturday Night Fever soundtrack in vinyl, if I see one in good shape.” he said.

“Just for a flex piece.”

WASHINGTON DC –

Declaring that “the American people deserve more from this administration,” President Donald Trump called a press conference this morning to announce that he has initiated proceedings to impeach his Vice President, Mike Pence.

“While this administration has produced amazing results in our first year, probably the best start for an administration in US history,” said the President, “there have been a lot distractions. And frankly, someone needs to be held accountable. So, I have decided to start impeachment proceedings against the Vice President effective immediately.”

Full Court Press

Promising a “full court press” against the former Indiana Governor, who agreed to run as part of the President’s ticket in 2016, President Trump said he will bring the full might of the United States government to bear, to ensure that the Vice President is impeached quickly and efficiently. “It’s important that we take care of this right away, so that we can get back to work making America great again.”

While the President cannot bring articles of impeachment himself, he displayed an executive order to reporters stating:

“I will hereby impeach the Vice President right after our weekly Tuesday lunch, at which time I will inform him he is fired, and he will walk thru the large double doors at the end of the oval office so he can get on an elevator. We will also have a camera man stationed in the elevator to record his reaction as he leaves the building.”

The President did not relish the thought of impeaching his friend. “I like Mike, but he has just not been producing for his team,” he said matter of factly. “At our cabinet meeting it was clear that while other team members were bringing in lots of donations for the Trump Foundation, Mike was not holding up his end. For instance, he said he was working on a website, but when his team asked him to show them his progress, he just made excuses about his computer not working right.”

Wasn’t Working On The Website

“Ivanka, who is very smart about cyber, asked him if he was using Windows to build the website. But Mike couldn’t answer this very simple question which anyone who knows about websites could answer. So, although I could not impeach him at that meeting since the camera crew was not there, I decided I should do it as soon as possible.”

Constitutional law expert, Martin Brackish, of the conservative think tank Caput Inanis, said that as long as President Trump can convince the House and Senate that Vice President Pence did not build a website, the impeachment proceedings should be a slam dunk. “It’s really an up or down vote. When all is said and done, it really boils down to one thing: did Vice President Pence let his team down?”

“When cabinet members were making calls to wealthy friends on the phone bank, where was Mike?” said Mr. Brackish. “Chief Of Staff Kelly was busy running the car wash. H.R. McMaster did a nice job coordinating helicopter rides for $100 each, bringing in a lot of contributions. Kelly Anne managed the eyeliner tips seminar at Mar-A-Lago. But what did the Vice President do to help get to the goal of 10,000 in donations for the Trump Foundation?”

“Honestly, it doesn’t look good,” Mr. Brackish said.

Up Against Dancing With The Stars

A statement released by the White House said that although the impeachment proceedings will be up against stiff competition in “Dancing With The Stars,” and “Big Bang Theory,” they are confident Americans are ready for a new impeachment trial and will tune in.

Rumors that Kenneth Starr will make a cameo appearance were unconfirmed. But sources say there will be plenty of celebrity power over the course of the hearings which should last well into the fall season. According to the statement:

“The Impeachment of Mike Pence: VP Under Fire” will give networks a solid rating’s boost, be good for the President’s approval ratings, and good for the United States of America.

With an eye toward introducing the concept of cryptocurrency to young viewers, and possibly creating a new global monetary vehicle for the storage of wealth, Sesame Street today announced the creation of Bertcoin, a new digital currency.

Like many companies that have watched bitcoin and other internet currencies take off, Sesame Street had been toying with the idea of launching its own, and believed that the time was now right for Bertcoin.

Banker Bob, Director of Sesame Street Cryptocurrency Development explained: “our focus group research has told us that people see Bert as very trustworthy, especially in connection with finances, and money in general. For instance, when consumers were asked if Bert was someone they would feel comfortable holding their money, 99.9% responded that they would.”

“Our extensive brand recognition will allow us to leverage Bertcoin across all markets, and establish it as a new form of payment that many people will see as a reliable alternative to existing options.”

Similar To Bitcoin

The new cryptocurrency, which is currently being mined by Bert’s friend, Ernie, on their home computer, will resemble many of the existing products on the market.

“We have a large staff of characters that, frankly, have some time on their hands in between shooting episodes. So, we’ve put them to work developing Bertcoin. Big Bird is handling social media. Oscar the Grouch is in charge of compliance. And Cookie Monster is managing investor relations.”

Not Without Risk

Like other cryptocurrencies, Bertcoin will not be regulated by any governments, and investors who purchase them will not have the protection of federal deposit insurance as they do in traditional banks.

“We tell people who are interested in purchasing Bertcoin to consult with their financial advisors,” said Mr. Bob. “Ernie has installed all the latest virus protection software, and we have full confidence in the soundness of these electronic transactions. However, as with any investment, there is always an element of risk.”

Sky Is The Limit

As to the future of Bertcoin, Banker Bob was hesitant to make any predictions.

“Really we have no idea how big this will be. If people are willing to buy and sell Bertcoin with actual dollars, technically, there’s no reason it can’t become the dominant global currency of the 21st century.”

The new Bertcoin exchange will launch in early 2018. The currency will be honored in all shops on Sesame Street including the laundromat, Mr. Hooper’s store, and Luis and Maria’s Fix-It shop.

WASHINGTON, DC –

Given the fast pace at which the Trump administration has been filling positions on the federal bench, it’s understandable that a mistake could be made somewhere along the line.

And so it happened this week as the White House apologized for inadvertently recommending the appointment of an African-American judge to the federal bench, after sending over the wrong folder by mistake.

We Deal With A Lot Of Folders

The Judicial Nomination Administrator at the White House said the high number of folders in the office was to blame for the error.

“We have so many folders around here – there are stacks of them all over the White House. It’s really hard to keep them straight,” he said, agreeing to speak off the record. “Half the time I’m not sure if what I’m holding even pertains to my job. It’s very confusing.”

“But no, we did not intend to send that particular folder over,” he said.

A call was made to the Senate Judiciary Committee to retrieve the wrong folder as soon as the mistake was discovered, and the correct folder containing a white nominee was quickly sent over.

Mistake Never Became An Issue

Said a clerk at the Judiciary Committee: “given that 86 out of 87 Trump nominees for vacancies on the bench have not been African-American, we assumed that the folder was sent over for some other purpose, and set it aside until we could confirm with the White House.”

“When we heard that indeed they had not meant to send it over, it was easy enough to send back.”

The replacement nominee is expected to be confirmed by the Republican-led committee just as soon as all the members get a good look at the photo to make sure it’s someone they know can do the job.

RICHMOND, VA – In a recent study conducted by scientists at the National Science Research Place have concluded marijuana is up to 30x more harmful than crack, and 70x more addictive.

The researches were able to prove that marijuana, or “weed” as it’s known on the streets, causes a short term, intense high that leaves you craving more of the drug. The report says that marijuana junkies are often “violent, desperate people, with not much going on in their lives.”

“This is a national pandemic,” head researcher, the Master of Science states. “The long term effects of prolonged marijuana use include severe brain damage, nervous system failure and virtually all marijuana users will one day die. Marijuana junkies often resort to criminal activity to get their fix, such as armed robbery and murder.”

The study finds crack-cocaine not as dangerous as previously reported. “Crack addicts are mostly recreational users. It’s more of a mellow high. Side effects include the giggles and frequent stops to 7-11. I would say crack is generally harmless if used in mild dosages.”

The NSRP also debunked the ‘one glass of red wine per day is healthy’ myth. “It’s a total urban legend that one glass of red wine is healthy for you, it’s more of a tease. To get any real benefits you need to have at least 8 glasses per day, and it doesn’t have to be wine. You can substitute each glass for 12oz of straight vodka, whiskey, beer or anything with alcohol in it.”

When asked about the subjects used in the study, one scientist confirmed it was themselves. “To really understand the effects of the different drugs, we administered them to ourselves. In fact, I’m high on crack right now.”",New study proves marijuana more harmful than crack-cocaine,http://thevalleyreport.com/2015/09/02/new-study-proves-marijuana-more-harmful-than-crack-cocaine-2/,thevalleyreport.com

Ireland’s McDonald’s chain raised workers salaries to what translates to $15 US at the start of 2015 — it wasn’t long before the economy collapsed and left the people of Ireland not much more than a tired, poor, huddled mass.

Ordinary citizens like Gilly McCuddy are saying: “This spring I was making $16 and the workers at McDonald’s only made like $8. Suddenly they’re only making one dollar less than me per hour? My social standing was completely devalued overnight. I was so depressed I had to quit my own job, go on welfare and rely on our socialist health care system here, so I won’t have much longer to live.”

The system couldn’t support the multitudes falling victim to the depression stemming from other people’s earnings. Local bar-tender and owner of the Blarney Stone Inn Franklin Flaherty who preferred not to be identified was quoted as saying “It’s simple math – if they get a raise that size, then I deserve a much bigger raise to maintain the..the gap of…how much better I am than they are! But I own my own business. I can’t give myself a raise unless I start charging more for my goods & services. So I doubled the price of my drinks, and then no one would buy. Well I was so angry, I torched the Inn and now my family and I are on the streets, and it’s all thanks to bloody McDonald’s employees.”

After I returned to the US, Senator Rand Paul sat down with me to discuss what it would mean if this wage rise was ever reproduced in his home state of California. He greets me with a firm handshake and I ask if he’s been overseas to see the devastation yet. “No, but you see, this is exactly why we cannot allow these so-called workers this luxury. Not only should we not raise wages — We must lower the minimum wage or better yet, erase it completely and let the invisible hand of the market take control. All government bureaucracies must end including the FDA. And if it turns out one day that, for example.. malnourished, vengeful McDonald’s employees making $1 an hour are flat-out pouring poison into the food and it’s killing millions of Americans — well McDonald’s will lose business, won’t they? And some other businesses will come out on top, so it all works out fine in the long run. Look, I can tell you, as soon as I am commander-in-chief, we will forever shut down the American government in its entirety, even if it’s the last thing I do as a politician.”

Senator Paul sniffs his McDouble and puts it back down. “If only a restaurant like a Taco Bell could run on slave labor, in 20-25 years it would be the only fast food franchise still standing.” Struck by such a moment of genius, he then pulls out his phone, tweets out what he just said to me, and former “Governator” Arnold Schwartzenegger tweets back: “I’ll believe that when I’m the President. ha ha ha ha.” Sylvester Stallone couldn’t be reached for comment.

As for Ireland, they have a long road to recovery. The stories of Gilly McCuddy and Franklin Flaherty are just two of millions. The economy has collapsed. Every McDonald’s location has closed its doors like so many Blockbuster Videos. The citizens are up shite creek without a paddle. If my photographer hadn’t gotten sick from the smell, I would’ve had proof of it. But what’s left is a faded memory of golden arches and the low wages of a bygone era.

A McDonald’s employee-turned-homeless-loser told me “We made a grave mistake thinking we deserved more. As you probably know, everyone here in Ireland used to enjoy a Shamrock Shake, two… sometimes three times a day, year-round. And you couldn’t beat those french fries. Well it’s all in the past now. This country will be potato-starved like never before.

GAINESVILLE, FL – A 37-year-old man is dead after his trailer home was destroyed in a meth-lab explosion, caused by him lighting up ‘blue angels’ to amuse his wife.

The man’s wife was found lying naked on the couple’s front yard, reportedly still laughing. “A Blue Angel is when you put a lighter up to your butt and fart on it, making it catch on fire. It’s funny as s—,” explains the mans wife, who claims to be an expert on the subject. “Normally we go to Del Taco because of their $0.59 tacos, but we made some extra cash this week so we went to Chipotle. The farts you get from there could fill a gas chamber. I know he’s looking up from hell laughing his ass off saying it was worth it,” she says smiling through blackened teeth, apparently not caused by the fire.

The woman plans on suing Chipotle, which failed to address their peppers causing a higher rate of methane in human farts. She offered a statement, “I’m not mad about my husband dying, I just got my eyebrows did and now they’re gone.” Chipotle Mexican Grill has yet to respond.

LAS VEGAS, NV – A scientific study conducted at Forlorn University shows ‘thoughts and prayers’, especially immediately after a tragedy, reduce violence by an astounding 0%.

“Wow, zero percent. Quite an accomplishment,” the president stated. “I’ve been shooting off thoughts and prayers like paper towels since Monday morning. I thought I sprained my wrist by how much I’ve been firing them out, but it might’ve come from patting myself on the back so hard.”

While offers of comfort through an expression of concern is certainly not a bad thing, it is completely useless in preventing further tragic events. In fact, the thoughts and prayers often reaffirm it will happen again, giving an inverted sense of condolence to victims. “It’s like they died for nothing,” a relative said. “If this resulted in one step in any direction to reduce the slaughter of American lives by even one, then some of these deaths wouldn’t feel like they were for nothing. Instead, they’re just collateral damage, almost a notch in the bedpost, or gun barrel of statistics everyone is desensitized to.”

“As the bible says, ‘change will happen without action. God helps those who do nothing,'” the president said. “There will be another tragedy, most likely sooner than later, that will make everyone move on from this one.”",Scientific study shows ‘thoughts and prayers’ reduce violence by 0%,http://thevalleyreport.com/2017/10/04/scientific-study-shows-thoughts-and-prayers-reduce-violence-by-0/,thevalleyreport.com

CEDAR RAPIDS, IA – Police and fire-paramedics were called to a restaurant when it had to close its doors early on Tuesday evening after a woman spent 45 minutes in the bathroom causing ‘unbearable, inhuman stench’.

“I want to make America great again,” Trump states to much fan-fare. “These vague, pandering statements are more than just hot air to me.

OVERLAND PARK, KS – A Kansas teenager died Friday night after the first reported overdose in this year’s newest drug fad ‘fart-huffing.’

“It’s a way for kids to get high and avoid failing drug tests,” states the Police Chief. “A typical session has five or six teenagers bake narcotics into food and feed it to someone dubbed the ‘Dumpster Pig’, a person with a high tolerance for drugs with a large buttocks capable of delivering flatulence in massive doses. Usually the hired Dumpster Pig is an outside person, paid with the drugs he or she consumes. Typically in their mid-to-old twenties, past their prime years of having people exchange drugs for sexual favours. After the drugs are consumed, the Dumpster Pig acts as a human bong for the rest of the group, passing gas directly into the faces of the participants providing a short, intense high. The chemicals found in flatulence disguise the traces of narcotics modern drug testing detect.”

We spoke to a student partaking in the session that killed his friend. “We only started fart-huffing at the beginning of the school year, so we didn’t fully understand the dangers. We managed to get the queen of all Dumpster Pigs to mellow down with us. It comes with a high cost as she usually gets too high and grinds all over us, shouting ‘where’s the good peen at? Everyone wants this because I am so hot. The more the merrier!’ She showed up drunk, falling all over the place.

NEW YORK – A 41-year-old woman had the winning lottery ticket worth over 3 million dollars on Friday night, but showed up to work anyway on Monday to deliver one last package.

The courier company had no idea of her winnings. “I knew something was wrong because I came back from lunch and the door to my office was closed,” said the manager. I slowly opened the door to discover the woman with her pants around her ankles, hunched over on my desk like a hippopotamus/cheetah dropping a massive poo on my desk. She shot her head towards me and locked eyes. I was frozen in shock and fear. In my peripheral vision I saw a huge mud-monkey sliming out of her butt like a Play-Doh fun factory.”

“It was worth it,” the woman said on arrest. “On Friday when I realized I hit the lotto, I knew this would be the first thing I would do. I hit up every Mexican food truck and saved my dumps all weekend. I was shuffling around like a death-row inmate trying not to explode. I’ve been putting up with that guy’s shit for years, it’s time he put up with some of mine.”

CANTON, OH – A 22 year old woman was arrested after stabbing her boyfriend in the face with a sharpened selfie-stick because he did not like her post on Instagram within the allotted 10 minute timeframe.

“This is atrocious, I can’t believe I am being charged for exercising what should be a constitutional right,” says the suspect. “This is 2015. When are the fat cats in Washington going to wake up and realize that when you are in a relationship, you must like your partner’s picture as soon as they post it. If anyone is the victim here, it is me.”

Her lawyer also made a statement. “This young woman acted in self defence, he assaulted her feelings. She spent over 3 hours picking and adjusting the perfect filter for her selfie. She even logged into Facebook Messenger and saw he was ‘online now’ and had yet to acknowledge and validate her appearance, as though he thinks she is ugly. For the man to wait an entire 11 minutes is a senseless, barbaric act of violence towards her self-esteem.”

“This woman is a political prisoner, persecuted because of her race” adds the DA, who plans to drop all charges. “I too suffer from WGP [white girl problems] and am sick of people trying to hold me accountable for my unreasonable, borderline psychotic reactions to tedious things. Her boyfriend could’ve been doing anything during those 11 minutes, like sleeping with other women. I can’t even imagine the level of anxiety she must’ve felt while sharpening that selfie-stick, waiting for him to return home. The man survived the attack but we will be filing assault charges against him and pursuing the death penalty.”

“We get them out. White right-wing extremists account for over twice as many terrorist incidents than Islamic extremists, so everyone with European heritage has to get out of the country.

SCOTLAND – A small, gross dog has been convicted by the higher canine courts for sporting a mustache resembling Hitler’s.

“He can’t help it, that’s just the way his fur grows!” the dog’s lawyer pleaded. The case was not helped by footage posted on social media of the dog walking through broken glass with his legs stretched far out, similar to the Nazi march. “He didn’t want to get broken glass on his paws! C’mon!”

The court said the mustache was grown in ‘bad taste’ and is oppressive to other people’s feelings. “This dog is oppressing the bubble some individuals have created to separate themselves from reality and reason. The dog was also spotted by neighbors reaching for a dog treat, just like how the Nazis salute. Is this a joke? Here in 2018, the only thing worse than Nazism is a joke about it.”

The courts added, “Even if the mustache was grown as a joke, we do not appreciate making light of radical authoritarian nationalism. To punish it, we must censor what people, sorry – dogs, are allowed to do and say and put them in prison for expressing themselves.”

When he said he couldn’t possibly know why she had a dream like that, she took out his nine iron and murdered him with it.”

“It still counts as cheating, even though it didn’t really happen,” the woman explained. “He said that was ridiculous, as though my horoscope and subconscious mind were wrong. He attacked my intuition as a woman so I defended myself with his golf club.”

Congregants report that as Cranston attempted a barely coherent prayer, he unconsciously said the names of the guitar chords he was playing as he spoke.

The transcript of the prayer was made available after the recorded church service was put online Monday morning: “Father God, we just cry out to you—B natural—We just, like need you Lord, in—E major—your mercy and just, like, all your—back to the B—love and stuff.

When asked if he was aware of what he had done, Cranston replied, “People don’t know how hard it is leading worship. There are just a lot of moving parts. I was trying to strum on the beat, remember the chord changes, the chord shapes, trying to pray within the stanzas of the song, all while entering the throne room of God and allowing the Holy Spirit to guide me in prayer while I tried not to use the word ‘just’ too often because I have received criticism for that in the past and just—no, I don’t remember.”

Finding themselves pessimistic about the future and saddled with student debt, millennials often turn to socialism, and also tend to say things like “Hey, maybe it would be fun to touch that hot, glowy thing above the oven.”

These new attitudes towards stove touching, putting one’s face in a sack full of badgers, and socialism is changing the Democratic Party, already resulting in a surprise win for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the NY-14 primary who openly ran on a platform of democratic socialism along with “democratic sticking your face in a sack full of badgers,” which is “fundamentally different” from the old style of just sticking your face in a sack full of badges, according to Ocasio-Cortez.

“The system has failed in getting a close look at badgers,” Ocasio-Cortez told an enthused crowd. “It’s past time to just stick our face in a sack full of them.”

“These are exciting, progressive ideas,” said Zachary Nichols, 27, who had attended the speech and is an advocate for putting his face in a sack full of badgers, socialism, and touching a hot stove. “And there are so many benefits from them such as close observation of the habits of badgers, a fairer distribution of income, and quickly heating one’s hand.”

“Oh, that’s just Ben for you!” said Ben’s mother Kathryn, 31, breaking into nervous laughter.

“He’s just full of energy,” commented Ben’s father, Tom, 28, as he wrestled a plastic bag off his son’s head, noting the boy’s obliviousness to his own mortality and complete taking-for-granted his parent’s constant efforts to keep him alive.

“A regular, healthy boy!”

According to the family, Ben’s favourite dinnertime game is to unexpectedly fling himself out of his high chair, making it clear that he has yet to allot any fucks to the phenomenon of gravity.

“It’s really a catch 22,” said Dr. Chester Burns, child development expert. “Children don’t gain the ability to give any shits until their parents, inevitably, fail to save them from the consequences of their actions, starting a lifetime of misguided resentment and deep rooted mommy/daddy trust issues,” he added before excusing himself to call his mother.

“I never should’ve told him they were like little faces,” Kathryn said, after pulling Ben away from tongue-kissing the power outlets goodnight. “but it was the only thing that would cheered him up after I told him he couldn’t eat the driveway salt.”

“Back in my day, you could only get a Caramel Macchiato or Brown Sugar Shortbread Latte in the two downtown area Starbucks,” explained Rythe to his three grandchildren before taking a long puff on his e-pipe. “And the two stores were more than a mile apart. You’d have to drive in the cold, icy winter when we still had winters. You couldn’t just drone order it like the kids do these days.”

The coffeehouse chain recently opened its 400th store and drone-port in the Whitehorse serving a population of 100,000, but times were not always as convenient for the early 21st century pioneer Byron Rythe.

“And it was only in the year of twenty-seventeen that townspeople finally got a third Starbucks located some 300 feet beside another Starbucks…but you still had to go into a grocery store.”

“Wow!” the captivated children exclaimed in unison.

The senior Whitehorse resident detailed how he once had to wait over five-minutes for what was called an old-fashioned ‘pour-over’ made by a non-robotic employee when the brew of his liking was not available.

“Times were tough and primitive, but we managed stay alive in Canada’s North.”

The changes made to the report include that the mosque had asked police to enforce the sharia traffic code and that women be expelled entirely from the Montreal borough of Côte-des-Neiges.

The mosque in question has categorically denied each of the allegations and pleaded for a few days free from harassment, death threats, and patently false accusations.

TVA’s reporter Marie-Pier Cloutier asserted that the single, unverified Facebook post she had used as a source seemed “pretty air-tight” and enough to report on as factual.

The mosque story is not the first report of TVA’s to raise suspicions. A report in January of this year claimed that Quebec’s dominant language would be Haitian Creole by the year 2020. Earlier this month TVA reported that Adidas was paying Quebec’s school children to speak English.

Asked how he felt about anti-Islam groups like La Meute gaining traction through dubious reports, TVA executive Pierre Carbonneau admitted it made him a little uncomfortable.

425,425,2017-08-08 00:00:00,"TORONTO – Statistics Canada reported today that roughly 9 out of 10 emails sent during August were out of office messages.

Out-Of-Office-Traffic (OOOT) spikes are expected in summer as workers follow annual migration patterns away from urban centres to anywhere they can allege has weak or no Internet access in order to avoid obtuse management requests, pointlessly cc’d email chains from colleagues, and unreasonable client demands. But Data Flow Analyst and report author Yordy Milchev said this year’s figure represents an all-time high.

Competing email systems frequently instigate bot wars capable of producing hundreds of millions of emails an hour. Milchev cited the example of Nancy Johnson-Funt, Assistant Manager at a Lethbridge Suzy Shier store who sent a flurry of outgoing emails to try and “get on top of things” just before activating her holiday absence message last month. Her actions triggered a reciprocal loop with 132 different recipient systems before her store’s antiquated Dell server caught fire from the computing load and burned down both the clothing outlet and the adjacent food court’s longstanding Cinnabon franchise.

Milchev says despite these troubles, the lessons from this summer’s OOOT wars are useful. “We are trying to get our computers to understand that most of the workforce is on vacation. Right now, they can’t quite figure it out and end up fighting each other. Let’s just hope the OOOT bots don’t evolve and invent their own language like those Facebook ones, or we’re really screwed.”

“The Porcupine caribou herd will not have to take that exhausting 2,400 km annual migration and instead hitch a ride with a mining truck,” explained a Martin Krusch, a resource development officer for the territorial government. “And just the other day, I saw a polar bear and her cubs along the road trying to flag down motorist while holding a sign that said ‘Toronto Zoo.’”

If the federal government’s moratorium on arctic oil and gas development is lifted, the road may open up employment opportunities for narwhals and fin whales to work on offshore rigs.

Witnesses describe the incident as “a scene from upper-middle class hell’ as more than 200 crazed shoppers all reached for what many of them believed to be the very last loaf of a crusty baguette.

“After 20 years on the force, I’ve never seen so much biting, scratching, hair pulling, and punching for bread that is $2 cheaper down the street,” explained RCMP Sgt. Laura Marco shaking her head while standing among the debris of bread crumbs and wrappers.

Soccer moms and retired civil servants took turns tackling and beating one another to get expensive-looking staple product, which is also available almost everywhere else at a much cheaper price.

The violence quickly spread to the deli where free samples of meat and cheese became a donnybrook. Several fist-fights broke out between overzealous consumers over line cutting for expensive aged cheddar and delicious prosciutto.

“It tastes better because it’s more expensive!” yelled a man while ramming a shopping cart filled with bulk cashews, brie cheese, and figs into the crowd.

Despite the mayhem and 52 hospitalizations, many locals celebrated that fact that their town of 25,000 people north of the 60th parallel finally has two Starbucks within a 300 foot radius of each other and a third down the street.

“This is how our family has always done it,” sighed Dana as she recited her rehearsed explanation of the days’ events. ”Now is a very special time for all daughters when our bodies develop womanly features and our fathers pull away both physically and emotionally.”

“This phenomenon manifests itself in different ways around the world but what is central to this upset is that men feel weird when their daughters get boobs,” said Dr. Natasha Hedberg, head of the Family Psychology unit at the Canadian Institute for Better Minds. “Our culture has adopted a ceremonial approach, exhibited, for example in the common the drawing of a circle around how far the father must stand away from his teenage daughter. And of course, the “Last Hug”. This may seem harsh, however, at least the girls are not left in a fog of confusion, wondering why their father doesn’t want hang out anymore.”

We asked Black’s father, Doug, if he thought this “distancing” could be avoided by simply focusing on developing a different relationship to his daughter as a teenager and young adult.

REPORTS coming into WWN suggest Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has discovered an underground Republican cave on par with any cave seen in the Batman movie franchise.

Having been installed a Sinn Féin leader for a few months now, a curious Mary Lou McDonald took to more closely examining her new office, most recently occupied by former long standing leader of her party, Gerry Adam.

Running her finger along a book shelf which had gathered dust, she watched as the discarded dust danced freely in the air before noticing the complete absence of dust beside an old leather bound book titled ‘Completely Not Suspicious. Just Normal Sinn Féin Stuff, Do Not Touch’.

Unable to resist the urge, the SF leader slipped the book free from the shelf, which, to her shock triggered a tremendous sound, seeing the book shelf sink into a secret compartment revealing steps down to a secret underground cave.

Using the light on her iPhone, McDonald carefully made her way down the steps to the cave with each flash of light revealing a treasure trove of modern Republican technology, state of the art Balaclava technology and a well meaning and supportive butler named Old Fred.

“We’ve been waiting for you for some time McDonald,” said a booming voice in the distant darkness, identified only by the flash of his beaming white teeth.

It is believed McDonald, although awe struck by what she found, will need some time to comes to terms with what her new role entails.

“We call this the Republicanmobile,” Old Fred said while pulling a sheet off a car to reveal a 1991 Opel Corsa.

GIRLS, have you found the one? Are you sure? We’ve taken a look at some recent statistics, and we’ve found that unless he’s causing you to have at least one proper ugly-crying session every week, he may not be Mr. Right.

Figures show that although some guys are ideal for spending the rest of your life with, together in a quiet, uneventful but otherwise blissfully perfect union… where does that leave you when it comes to having something to angrily bitch about to your pals on Monday morning?

Here’s a few things to look out for, to make sure your man is indeed the one:

1) Does he treat you right?

Is he really nice to you, at all times? Does he cancel his plans if he hears you’re feeling down and could do with a night of snuggles in front of the TV? Does he always notice when you get your hair done, and compliment you straight away? If the answer is yes, he might not be the one for you. Life is short, are you going to settle for someone who doesn’t even give you enough ammo for one good WhatsApp group chat bitching session?

2) Does he cheat?

And if he doesn’t cheat, what’s he playing at? He can’t possibly be 100% faithful to you without some sort of ulterior motive. Never trust a faithful man, they’re always up to something. A guy who goes behind your back all the time? Now there’s something for you to get really worked up over, maybe even have a genuine screaming match or two. Drama is the spice of life, and this guy is motherfucking paprika!

3) Do you feel great when you’re with him?

If so, dump him straight away. You’re better off without him. Now please peruse the rest of our website, where you’ll find ads that will help you find the right cosmetics, hair products and clothing to give yourself something to feel good about yourself.

The first knockout game of the tournament was a huge disappointment as France and Argentina only managed 7 goals between them and not even one angry Argentinian player getting sent off after losing his temper.

However, Argentina defender Nicolas Otamendi was the most prolific player in his team at the tournament as he booted more balls at opposition players as they lay on the ground than anyone else.

Mbappe, named after the Hanson b-side to Mmmbop, is too young to remember such songs as at just 8 years of age, becomes the second youngest player to score 2 goals in one game at a World Cup after a nobody name Pele.

It wasn’t all good news for Mbappe as he was fined by Russian police for breaking the speed limit as he raced into the box and was fouled by Marcus Rojo, winning a penalty.

France blew Argentina away with 3 goals in 10 minutes but not before Angel Di Maria got a chance to launch a heat guided beauty of a goal into the top corner, prompting the watching world to say ‘fuck, did you see that?’ in their respective languages. Selfish bastards that the French are, right back Pavard couldn’t let Di Maria have his moment and scored a goal for the ages not long after.

Mbappe’s incredible tour de force on the pitch also ushered in rare sightings of the Told You So bird in WhatsApp groups and pubs. In this case, the Told You So bleets and chirps in an effort to draw people’s attention to the fact that they knew Mbappe was a brilliant, world beating talent before anyone else did.

Lying in wait in nearby shrubbery is the Never Rated Him, who will howl and howl and howl once Mbappe miscontrols a ball in the match against Uruguay. Never Rated Him also declared Messi as ‘shit’ after the game concluded.

Concern has been expressed for Maradona as he didn’t feature much on TV screens during the games, with TV directors noting he didn’t look nearly coked up enough.

FIFA, disappointed to miss out on having Ronaldo and Messi face off in a quarter final against one another, have kidnapped the stars and will force them to fight to the death for the amusement of Russian billionaires who have already placed their bets.

Protecting his fragile ego, everyone in Portugal has agreed to pretend Ronaldo won the tournament singlehandedly. A parade in his honour is scheduled to take place in Lisbon tomorrow.

Cavani was the undoubted star of the evening’s fixture and in his first goal, which was a delight to watch, he became the first person to score by heading the ball mostly using his eye socket.

Eamon Dunphy dismissed Edison Cavani’s first goal which included a glorious cross field 1-2 with Luis Suarez as ‘Martin O’Neill hoofball’.

Luis Suarez’s constant diving which involves grabbing his head and feigning agony no matter where he has been struck on his body has finally been explained by the Uruguay team doctor: “Luis has a rare condition where every nerve in his body is connected directly to the part of the brain that feels pain, so he is not a cheating bastard as people have said, he is, instead, a gravely ill and brave hero in a state of constant pain”.

Today’s games see Russia beat Spain because sorry, do you think Vladimir Putin is going to let anything other than a Russia win happen on home soil?

The last day of the group stages were brought to a close with a stunning flurry of goals and helter skelter football played at a break neck speed some awful matches.

In the first set of games Senegal thought they had won a penalty in their match with Colombia before VAR ruled a challenge on Sadio Mane was in fact the stuff of hard bastard defender’s dreams. VAR replays allowed viewers to admire Sanchez’s tackle in slow motion again and again, while perverts used the slow motion replay to zoom in on Sanchez’s tackle instead.

Yerry Mina, who sounds like he’s named after a small village just outside of Belmullet, fired the Colombians ahead with a header.

Severe headaches were reported among football fans as they tried to crunch the numbers and permutations regarding the fate of Colombia, Japan and Senegal.

As the afternoon’s games came to a close FIFA ushered a team of the world’s leading scientists onto the sideline in a bid to decipher which teams would be going through to the knockout stages and why. Sweating and clearly irritable, the scientists frantically jotted down complex equations on several oversized whiteboards before collapsing in tears, unable to figure out exactly why Japan were advancing at the expense of Senegal.

With a goal difference of plus 1, having both scored 4 goals each, and having players with an equal amount of G’s in their names, Japan advanced into the last 16 on account of having fewer yellow cards than Senegal prompting TV pundits to get really angry because they don’t understand the world anymore.

England, who will be knocked out by Colombia in a few day’s time, spent much of last night debating who they would prefer to play in the World Cup final much to the amusement of everyone.

England’s match against Belgium saw both teams ring in the changes playing their weakest possible line ups, but such is the magic of the World Cup this didn’t ruin the occasion, it instead allowed your Dad 90 minutes to rant at the television, recalling a more honest time when diving hadn’t been invented yet, you were allowed spit in player’s hair and teams didn’t conspire to play for a result that suited both of them.

Adnan Januzaj’s strike forced TV viewers to stop doing whatever it was they were doing to prevent themselves from falling asleep and rush back to the TV to watch the replays of his stunning goal.

The teams, aware they were providing fans with a perplexingly boring match, began trying to gift the internet with content for future memes with Belgium’s Mitshi Batshuayi kicking ball off post only to have it rebound into his face in hilarious fashion.

Over on ITV Gary Neville, Ian Wright and Lee Dixon talked enthusiastically about England’s path to the semi-finals was easy as pie, which prompted TV viewers here in Ireland to get their phones out and record the TV pundits, knowing it would come in handy in a few days time when Colombia smashed in their second goal in the first 15 minutes of their tie against England.

Worry has been expressed for Eamon Dunphy after he mentioned Tinder, and did a 98 minute piece of analysis on Marouane Fellaini, claiming him to be the greatest player of all time.

Elsewhere, FIFA president Gianni Infantino confirmed that if Senegal were unhappy with the way they were knocked out of the tournament FIFA could offer them the chance to buy back into the tournament for just $2.3 billion.

THERE were solemn scenes at the White House’s 4th of July celebrations as US President Donald Trump paid tribute to the noble men and women who fell fighting the attempted alien invasion of Earth this day 22 years ago, criticising the fact no previous president had honoured them on the anniversary of the country’s Independence Day.

Standing on the very location once obliterated by the alien military in 1996’s fictional movie Independence Day, Trump touched a picture of the White House being blown up before touching his chest where a heart is normally located, then mimicking the crying of tears as he hugged a picture of Will Smith for far too long.

“A true American hero, and a great friend,” Trump said in the beginning of a speech his minders really wished they could have persuaded him not to give.

Trump also credited the leadership of then president actor Bill Pullman and stressed the need now, more than ever, for a Space Force Military.

“Will Smith. I know him, you know that? A great friend, the best. The aliens, you know the aliens, they came here and boy did they do damage but Will gave them hell,” Trump said, before noting that when watching the footage live in 1996 he remembers hearing some Muslims cheering on the aliens.

Smith, who has gone years without an official 4th of July White House ceremony in his honour, was not present during Trump’s speech.

“The last time we won a war, an actor, Bill Pullman, was president, interesting. It’s time to send a warning to the aliens,” Trump concluded as a number of White House aides finally resigned en masse.

David Cowans, of Byron Services LTD, who routinely spaces out during the day and fails to respond to direct questions to his face, took it upon himself to mark an email ‘URGENT’ and send it to both your work and personal email.

Cowans is believed to be just one of thousands of bosses here in Ireland and elsewhere who understand that once an employee makes the mistake of syncing their work email with their phone, there is no escape.

“Did you get that email re the Kavanagh meeting tomorrow?” Cowans added in a follow up text to you which seemed to indicate you were unaware that your terms of employment actually mean you work 24/7.

Frustrations increased as Cowans then responded to a WhatsApp he sent you which was marked as read with ‘I can see you read that last message, I see the blue ticks. Have you read the email? Need response asap’.

WWN are all-in when it comes to creating a safe, inviting space for all our employees, regardless of race, creed, or gender, and as such we’ve adopted a number of unisex toilet facilities around our office to ensure the comfort of staff who may not identify as any particular sex.

However, whatever you identity as, you can appreciate the situation one might find themselves in after utterly destroying the bowl with a prize-worthy dump after a hard night out on the drink and the kebabs, only to realise that there’s a member of the opposite sex standing outside the stall waiting on you to emerge.

We at WWN pride ourselves on our inclusiveness, but we still have a long way to go when it comes to being comfortable around Kelly from accounts payable while the mist of our filth hangs thick in the air. Should you work in a similar environment, here’s a few tips:

1) Learn to be more comfortable

Boys don’t mind farting around boys. Girls don’t mind doing wet shites around girls. This is all due to years of social conditioning where the two sexes were taught to act in a certain way, to either afford the other sex a modicum of respect, or to maintain an air of dignity and decorum because that’s what society demanded of you. In a unisex toilet situation, you just have to be brave enough to smash through these chains and own your Monday morning scutters; stride out of that stall and cheerfully greet whoever is in the room, whether that’s Janet who you have lunch with every day, or the cute lad who fixes the photocopier from time to time. They’re all waiting on you to get out so they can poop too! Everyone poops! Let’s all poop together!

2) Stop acting like you’ve been caught doing something

Guys: the first time you emerge from a stall in a unisex bathroom and there’s a woman standing there, you may feel like you’ve accidentally wandered into the women’s jacks (Again! lol). Girls, you too! This is just a byproduct of spending your whole life going to a toilet exclusive for your own gender. It just feels unnatural, but you’ll get over this. Like the rat in the The Abyss, the one they put in the oxygenated liquid and he breathed it in? Based on the science that we all breathe liquid in the womb, we just have to remember how to do it again? And initially the rat was like, fuck this! Liquid! I’m drowning! And then he was like, oh yeah, wait, this is grand actually. You have seen The Abyss, right?

3) Dirty protest

Of course if you’re a bigot who isn’t into this whole gender-fluid-friendly community that we’re trying to cultivate here, you could go full Hunger Striker and smear large amounts of feaces on the stall walls and scrawl ‘this is what I always do in toilets so just get used to it’ in poop on the mirror. That’s not on, Jeff. You’re fired.

THE Republic of Ireland was said to be devastated following a crushing 2-0 defeat against old rival Lowry after yet another disappointing performance at their home ground, the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, yesterday afternoon.

Kicking off at 26th September 1997, Ireland began the game with a solid start under the watchful eyes of referee Justice Michael Moriarty, with several shots at goal going wide of the mark, including two payments made by businessman Denis O’Brien to Mr. Lowry in 1996 and 1999 totalling IR£500, 000 for the securing of a 1995 mobile licence, along with a beautiful long ball in which opened up a $50,000 donation to Fine Gael was made through Telenor on behalf of Mr. O’Brien’s Esat Digifone.

Despite the pressure from the Irish forward line, the multi-million euro Lowry team managed to pull it back just before the 2011 halftime whistle, where he was re-elected to represent Tipperary North at the 2011 general election, leaving Ireland 1-0 down going into the second half, much to the delight of Lowry’s 14,010 strong North Tipperary diehard fans.

Returning this time with replacement referee Judge Martin Nolan, Lowry once again fended off a strategic attack at the 2002 mark from Irish striker Revenue Commissioner, who lay on a beautiful €372,000 ball from Finnish company, Norpe OY, but only to be dispossessed at 2006 by Lowry defender and captain, Kevin Phelan, who regularly plays for the Glebe Trust club in the Isle Of Man alongside Lowry coach, Denis O’Brien.

Microphones belonging to Irish Independent journalists picked up Lowry egging on his Captain from the sidelines, shouting: “I’m asking you Kevin, for fuck’s sake, will you protect me just a small bit. For Jaysus sake, don’t land me in it, I’m destroyed as it fucking is. I can’t bring out that fucking 200 — that 250 — again. If that comes out I’m fucking ruined, I’m bankrupt,” later adding, “I’m asking you — I’m fucking begging you. Please don’t, because I’m not — they can’t find that 200. I never declared it”.

Ireland seemed set to equalize in the last five minutes by holding possession of the ball for a large majority, however, referee Judge Martin Nolan disallowed 2 Irish goals after conferring with the VAR jury.

Lowry’s second goal came in extra time when a penalty of €15,000 was awarded for a late tackle by the Revenue Commissioners, but did leave the Tipperary TD injured for the next 3 years.

Final score: Lowry 2-0 Ireland.

There have been a record number of complaints made to FIFA, with football fans claiming the World Cup is malfunctioning following England actually winning a penalty shootout.

Despite managing just no more shots in the 90 minutes after Harry Kane’s penalty, the English media have confirmed England have won the World Cup and that Sweden are a piss poor excuse for a team that will be beaten 19-0.

The game saw Colombia decide against actually playing football and invent a new sport called Bastardball which involved Sanchez riding on the back of Harry Kane in the penalty area, prompting the referee to give a penalty.

Sanchez’s foul, which saw him mount Kane, was so explicit it has been rejected by Pornhub. Colombia, a South American team full of passion and verve put aside those qualities in a bid to pack as many moments of shithousery into 120 minutes as Pepe and Sergio Ramos have managed in their entire careers.

Following the awarding of the penalty the Colombian players used a training ground move they had been practicing for days which saw them crowd the referee and pretend to be a swarm of angry wasps.

The players haranguing of the referee delayed the taking of the penalty for what seemed like hours, as the crowd grew increasingly restless officials in the stadium stuck the complete Lord of the Rings trilogy on the big screens which was watched in full before the Colombians finally calmed down, but not before scuffing up the penalty spot.

Noble, brave and courageous England did not stoop to the low levels of the Colombians, well except for Harry Maguire blatantly diving in the box and Jordan Henderson attempting a pathetic headbutt on a Colombian player.

Just as England were about to achieve the impossible; winning an important game in a straightforward manner, they conceded a last minute equaliser. Colombia’s Uribe improvised an amazing shot from 30 yards out which was tipped wide by Jordan Pickford in what must be save of the tournament, only for the subsequent corner resulting in a headed goal from Yerry Mina who at 8ft 8 inches is technically too tall to be permitted to play football according to English tabloids.

With either side failing to score in extra time all that was left was for England to lose on penatlies thus delighting Irish fans who aren’t remotely petty and bitter. However, thanks to a superb Pickford penalty save England are through the quarter finals.

It didn’t all go to plan for the English however, as out of habit the team’s bags were already placed on a flight home to London, along with the team’s families. It is hoped they can make it back in time for the game on Saturday.

Elsewhere, according to The Sun newspaper Sweden, who are famous for being cowardly neutral during World War II barely made through against Switzerland in a 1-0 win. Sweden, The Sun adds, is a horrible place where they let a bunch of foreigns in and don’t even get racist about it.

Else, elsewhere, Gianni Infantino has locked himself in his hotel room and stopped returning Vladimir Putin’s phonecalls after the Russian leader said he would like to call in a favour ahead of Russia’s game against Croatia.

TELEVISION owners have been warned to take appropriate measures to ensure their sexual well-being over the coming weeks, as doctors have confirmed that even a brief exposure to the TV show Love Island could be enough to cause a sexually transmitted disease.

The new season of Love Island launched last night with 11 contestants shipped off to a luxury destination where they will spend the next 8 weeks getting to know each others genitals on an hourly basis, with the resulting copulation aired on TV for an audience of millions of people who have decided that this is exactly the kind of thing they want to spend their fleeting lives watching.

Now in its fourth season, the reality show has had several years for sexual health specialists to study the effects of spending large amounts of time watching young people having casual sex with each other on live TV, and as such have issued a warning that watching Love Island every night for two months could give you a serious dose of the clap.

“We would advise wearing a condom while watching the show, or at least washing yourself in TCP after each episode,” said Dr. Sian Harrits, who cannot believe that this is what she’s doing with her degree in medicine.

“The action in Love Island has the potential to create televisually transmitted sexually transmitted diseases, or TVTSTDs, so prolonged exposure can result in chlamydia, gonorrhoea, crabs, and even full blown televisual AIDS. Make sure to keep yourself safe while watching”.

People concerned about their health were also advised that they could just not watch the show, but this was dismissed as impossible due to the fear of not being able to chat to everyone about it on social media.

CRESTFALLEN Waterford man Cathal Keys boarded his flight to Germany this morning while weeping openly, after navigating his way through Dublin airport for the first time without bumping into someone he knew.

Traditionally, a trip to the airport for the Tramore native isn’t complete without at least one interaction with someone he knows, usually consisting of a few lines of chit-chat about where the parties are heading and for how long.

Having made it through the car park, the baggage drop, the queue for security, the departure lounge including all available bars, the boarding gate and finally the 2km walk to the waiting Ryanair flight, Keys kept his eyes out for a recognisable face, before being told that if he didn’t get on the flight, he was going to be escorted back to the terminal by a member of security.

“But you always meet someone you know when you’re in the airport,” wept Keyes, as the steward on his 6:30AM flight served him with a can of Heineken.

“For all of my 36 years, I’ve never come to the airport without seeing a neighbour, an old teacher, some lad I met at a cousin’s wedding, someone I used to work with, Brendan O’Carroll, anyone… and then, today, I fell short.

“Where were they all at? Did they see me, and hide? Or has everyone just left the country? Will I ever see someone I know in the airport ever again? So much uncertainty”.

In a last-chance effort to keep his streak of seeing people he knows in the airport alive, Keys will make sure to see someone he knows when he returns to Dublin airport in three days time, if it means he has to hang around for hours.

THE World Health Organisation has been drafted in to help quell the rising panic being caused by one Waterford woman’s positive diagnosis of man flu, the first of its kind anywhere on earth.

Dubbed ‘Patient Zero’, to protect her anonymity, she is believed to be in her mid to late twenties, from Dungarvan and called Colette Derrickson, the woman was rushed to bed earlier this week after complaining of flu-like symptoms.

However, rather than shake off these symptoms and get on with things like all women would normally do, Patient Zero instead rapidly fell into a spiral of self pity, whinging, overly-dramatic displays of weakness and complaints that ‘there’s no-one in the world that’s as ill as I am right now’; telltale signs of man-flu, the extremely potent strain of flu thought only to affect men.

“We’re trying to establish whether or not this is just a particularly nasty flu, or full-on man-flu,” said a source close to The Who, the legendary rockers who have a keen interest in all matters medical.

“What we’re seeing with Patient Zero is not just the flu, but an apparent desire to stay sick so that she has something to complain about, rather than a desire to get better. That’s classic man-flu right there, and it’s very worrying. If this starts to spread, then the whole world is in danger of shutting down completely. Women are the only thing keeping the world from descending into chaos as men struggle with man-flu, so if they succumb to it too, it’s going to be pandemonium out there”.

Men have been advised to treat their ailing wives and girlfriends the same way they themselves are treated during bouts of man-flu, with plenty of fluids, paracetamol, and questions about pointless shit that can wait until after they’re better.

Football fans were repaid for their patience after enduring Spain and Russia with two far more entertaining games yesterday.

The football world is in mourning following the untimely death of Neymar after he was murdered by a stray Mexican player’s stud. A funeral will be held once the Brazilian’s body finishes rolling on the sideline.

The Mexicans tried to unnerve the Brazilians from the start with several player dyeing their hair Aryan blonde in a bid to prompt flashbacks to Brazil’s 7-1 semi-final loss to Germany in 2014.

Neymar appears to be the hooded Kermit the frog meme come to life in footballing form as Neymar’s internal dialogue seems to operate close to – Neymar: “Show the world what a great player you are” Other Neymar: “Was that a light breeze that passed by my leg? Better pretend I’ve been shot by a sniper while being electrocuted”.

On RTÉ Jim Beglin unleashed a line of commentary he was clearly working on for several weeks when he eagerly said “I’d prefer to see Neymar make history rather than histrionics”, and while viewers appreciated the liquid tongue of the Begster many preferred Brian Kerr’s take on the matter: “He’s having a giraffe, someone should lamp that dozy prick in the face. A good bursting is what he needs”.

Neymar showcased his brilliance as his genius back heel to Willian led to a tap in for the PSG forward, but it was too late for most fans who have labeled him a ‘colossal prick’.

Japan is now officially everyone’s favourite team following a spirited performance full of invention, skill, quick passing and intensity – all the things Belgium could be capable of if Roberto Martinez was not their manager.

Japan’s high pressing saw them produce a commanding performance which came undone in the closing minutes. Delighted viewers, who just before kick off had explained in detail why Japan would lose 18-0, were frantically looking up Wikipedia in a bid to explain ‘actually, I remember that now, Japan changed their manager not long ago and he introduced new tactics, I had a feeling they’d give Belgium a game’.

Haraguchi gave Japan the lead after a pacy counter attack with Inui adding a second minutes later after Kagawa created some space with his dancing feet. The Japan bandwagon was reportedly on the verge of collapse such was the volume of people claiming they were always Japan fans when Martinez introduced Fellaini switching to tactics which made Jack Charlton look like Pep Guardiola.

Fellaini was brought onto the pitch via a large crane, cementing himself in the box with orders to let all balls played into the box bounce off his head. Headed goals from Vertonghen and then Fellaini turned the tie around before poor Japanese decision making led to a breakaway goal for Nacer Chadhli after some sublime Lukaku play.

It was devastation for the thousands of people when Japan were knocked out as many were only three quarters of the way through finishing their Japanese flag facepaint and were on level one Japanese on Duolingo.

Over on BBC and ITV some viewers who were tuning in to watch yesterday’s knockout game were disappointed as the English broadcasters decided to have their panels discuss instead how they will be celebrating England definitely winning the World Cup.

Today’s games will either see the English media becoming so unbearable you might need to shut yourself off from the world until this is all over or have you chuckling with delight as you frantically search for the best ‘football’s not coming home’ memes.

ALL MAJOR social media networks have reported a staggering increase in the number of people taking selfies with ice creams, WWN can reveal.

A heavy influx of groan inducing updates have featured ice cream puns and play on words so awful it is believed Irish dads wouldn’t even utter them out loud.

“My mouth’s on a collision course with an Iceburger, full steam ahead” read one post, which unbelievably had upwards of a 942 likes, 345 hearts and 2 angry faces, presumably from the poster’s children.

“The generosity when it comes to likes for sunny, ice cream heavy snaps has resulted from the fact people are just beside themselves with joy that it’s not bucketing down with rain, they’re liking posts left, right and centre,” explained Dr. Ian Gunter, who lectures in Irish Weather Behaviour Patterns in UCD.

Irish social media feeds, normally filled with pics of home cooked meals, other people’s children and jogging routes no one cares about, has ground to a homogeneous halt with everyone choosing instead to let all their friends and family know that yes, it’s splitting stones out there, and yes, this is a picture of me absolutely horsing into a Loop the Loop.

All queries sent via text, Snapchat, Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp asking ‘what you up to?’ or ‘how was your weekend?’ have so far been responded to only via the medium of sending a selfie with an ice cream and the sort of smile normally reserved for when opening presents on Christmas morning.

Those worried their social media feeds will never return to just being pictures of cats, memes and the occasional rant about traffic in Dublin have been asked to be patient, this probably won’t last long.

THE unrelenting dedication and force with which campaigners and civil society groups met the campaign for the repeal of the 8th amendment with has left many people wondering what remaining bastions of a cold, conservative and hateful society were to be torn down next.

Well, with an announcement from the government today we have our answer: wearing socks with sandals.

“For far too long we have turned a blind eye to one of the most egregious and horrid acts in modern Ireland, but later this year, the country can vote to change this,” read a speech from Taoiseach Varadkar.

Pairing socks with sandals, be it at home or abroad, is worryingly on the rise, and if witnessed by a member of the public has been known to completely ruined their day altogether and often cause dry retching or vomiting.

“I knocked on every door up and down this country, begging, pleading, convincing people to vote Yes. I cried when the results came in. But I’m not done yet, socks paired with sandals are next,” remarked one anti-socks with sandals campaigner who can’t believe such a practice is still legal in 2018.

While many men of a certain age or a certain fashion-deficient lifestyle seem to be the group who have the most to lose in the upcoming S&S referendums, campaigners have reminded the media this isn’t a men’s only issue.

“In fairness some women have diabolical fucking fashion sense altogether. It’s not cool, it’s not trendy, it’s hideous,” screamed one campaigner through a megaphone in front of a raucous anti-S&S crowd, believed to number in excess of 500,000 people.

THE nation’s farmers have confirmed that Irish rural roads are theirs now for the next few months while they do whatever it is they do be doing with their large and very slow agricultural machinery.

Speaking on the phone to WWN while taking up the entire breadth of a country road, chairman of the Farming Association of Ireland, Tadhg O’Shea, advised motorists to simply “stay out of his fucking way” while he and his peers haul large quantities of silage from one location to another.

“These are our roads now,” O’Shea began, while blatantly ignoring all three mirrors on his untaxed tractor as a large stream of irate car drivers loomed behind him, “you people should probably think about just sticking to the motorways for the next few months, as we’ll be fairly busy eroding these country ones down to nothing while lacing them with large amounts of shite we’ll never be fined for”.

Forcing an oncoming Nissan Micra into the ditch as he took a bend on the other side of the road, O’Shea posed the question why cars are allowed on country roads in the first place.

“The roads around here are only fit for tractors and large machinery,” he pointed out, now laughing at the thoughts, “imagine actually paying road tax for this crap, spending your journey avoiding potholes, praying to Padre Pio on the dash that you don’t die by being hit head-on by a combine harvester – best stick to the good roads for the remainder of the season, guys, we’ve got subsidies to earn here”.

ONE OF America’s most famous magicians appeared in a New York court yesterday afternoon over the alleged disappearance of some 400 female assistants spanning over a 40 year period.

David Seth Kotkin, known by his stage name David Copperfield, was sworn in using a bible which he later turned into a bunch of flowers following his oath, before been warned by the judge that he was in contempt of court and made take the oath again.

“Mr. Copperfield, as much as everyone here may like magic, this isn’t the time or the place,” Judge Casey Robison addressed the defendant.

Apologising, Copperfield took to the stand where he proceeded to answer some tough questions relating to the whereabouts of some 423 women who had allegedly disappeared during his live stage shows which he toured at various locations around the world.

“I have no idea where they went,” the 61-year-old claimed, now pulling a string of multi coloured handkerchiefs from his ear to wipe a tear from his face, “they just stand in the box, and when I open it they’re gone.

Breaking down on the witness stand, Copperfield admitted making the women sign an extensive contract that waived any liability if they were ever to suddenly go missing.

“It’s not something magicians really think about,” he said, before a recess was called by the judge by the sudden appearance of a rabbit in the courtroom.

The trial is expected to last for the next 12 weeks during which previous assistants are expected to take the stand, including 7 women who were cut in half by Copperfield and 2 who still suffer from spontaneous levitations.

A BRAND new start-up has found an innovative way to overcome the dilapidated state of Irish roads after securing the rights to mass produce NASA’s lunar rovers from the Apollo missions.

The Waterford based company has been given the green light to start production on some 40,000 moon buggies which will be set to roll out on the Irish market by September this year.

The robust vehicle, which was originally designed by NASA scientists to travel over large craters, is expected to become the new mode of transport for rural Ireland, where some potholes have been measured up to 3 meters deep in some areas.

“Thousands of road accidents happen every year due to motorists trying to avoid potholes,” entrepreneur and founder of ‘Culchie Rover’ Tadhg Phelan explained, “so I said to myself ‘why not just use moon rovers instead of cars – the surfaces are almost identical’, so I did”.

Mr. Phelan applied to NASA for the blueprints last year and was granted permission to manufacture the moon buggy for Irish roads.

“All I did was send them a picture of the road outside my house,” he added. “They were so amazed by the similarities between Irish roads and the moon that they are now training astronauts to walk on Irish roads in space suits”.

The new buggies will also be exempt from road tax due to their low carbon emissions and the need to now not fix the millions of potholes on Irish roads, saving the government billions in maintenance costs.

TEMPERATURES are set to hit highs of 29 degrees next week and well, you’re fucked, we’re all fucked. But can the fragile physiological Irish bodies we call home cope with being hotter than the centre of the Sun (this point will be disputed by so-called experts but since humans have never been to the Sun, we’ll never know if it’s hotter than 29 degrees there).

WWN have compiled 6 tips to help prepare for being melted down to look like an insultingly inaccurate Madame Tussauds waxwork of a human being.

1) Go naked. Look, we’re all adults here, and we’re living in Ireland. We know full well we’re not used to this, so everyone will understand the heating hindrance clothes can be. They only add to the problem. Let it all hang out and catch what little breeze there is. If everyone promises to be sound and not look at each other’s bits, we can get through this.

2) Make sure to keep a constant supply of ice cubes, placing them on your most sweat prone areas such as your armpits and your crotch in order to cool yourself down. WWN is not liable for any ice burns incurred on genitalia.

3) Mount an industrial sized cooling fan onto your back, placing the fan itself directly onto your face, leave no more than a 1cm gap between face and fan to maximum cooling power.

4) Consume all ice cream within 30 seconds of purchase, consume other people’s ice cream too, everyone should help one another out in these testing heat sapping times. See a 99 with a flake, dig in.

5) Accept that you will get burnt because in all honesty who can avoid it, it’s not like we’ve had warning or are aware of the existence of sun cream, or the shade. However, try to just get a little bit of sunburn, not the sort that would require a skin graft down the line.

6) Adapt to life in the same way people living in the Sahara desert have done over thousands of years. Donedeal should have the odd camel or two for sale, that should set you on your way.

RIHANNA’S SHOWSTOPPING Met Gala look needs no introduction at this stage, ‘RiRi’ absolutely slayed it in her stunning Maison Margiela dress which nodded to the Papal crown, and now thanks to Penneys shoppers can get their hands on a knock-off for just 5 euros. Praise be!

While Rihanna bedazzled in her bejeweled crown and straight up killed it, now we all get the chance to represent in a knock off which is presumably fractionally cheaper than the real thing. Some people may not believe in God, but we’re believers in the word according to Saint Penneys, our prayers have been answered as we can replicate the glam, all for the price of an overpriced coffee with almond milk.

Some shops have already sold out of the replica Maison Margiela number, but Penneys have promised to restock the crown and dress later this week in all sizes, a move welcomed by many shoppers.

“My youngest is making her communion next weekend and we wanted her looking lit as fuck, and now we can get our wish. No one is going to outshine her,” confirmed one enthusiastic parent online.

Fashion savvy buyers have had to make peace with the fact that in a bid to avoid claims of outright copying of the dress, Penneys have had to make some compromises with some details but it’s a small price to pay for being able to hit your local GAA disco, early house or wake in style.

“Okay, so the jewels and shit are basically bits of pasta painted gold and black, and a lot of the silver finish is tinfoil, I’m still rocking the look but I’m just worried… is it a bit much,” queried 21-year-old Jade O’Dowd, first in the queue to buy the dress in Penneys Dundrum branch this morning.

However, in the last few minutes, fashion experts have confirmed the outfit is not one bit ‘extra’.

ONE Waterford woman has made the claim that she has ‘The. Best. Friends. Ever.’ in a recent social media post celebrating the friendship she shares with five women she routinely bitches about to her boyfriend, WWN can reveal.

Catríona Levanne (30) made the declaration after an afternoon of fun filled frollicks with a group of ‘mad bitches altogether’ normally referred to a Ciara, Jane, Brona, Laura, Anna and Leanne.

“I have the BEST. FRIENDS. EVER.” read Catríona’s social media posts across several apps, with the Waterford City native seemingly using a little known method of making such a statement more cast iron and empathic by writing each words in capitals, peppered with full stops for good measure.

Experts in the field of friendships were quick to comment on Catríona’s claim, with some speculating on the veracity of her assertions.

“Is this the same Catríona who said Jane was lazy and that’s why she hasn’t lost the weight, or the same one who said Leanne is thick as shit?” queried one professor of friendshipology.

The joyous declaration, believed to be the first of its kind, stands up to clearly jealous questioning and thus enters the friend group into the history books as the unequivocal greatest friends of all time.

“Who are we to question whether they are in fact the best. Friends. Ever. I don’t see anyone else anywhere making such claims on social media,” remarked another expert, seemingly siding with Catríona, who has since admitted to having consumed a significant amount of Prosecco before making the claims which was accompanied by 47 group selfies.

No word yet from Catríona or her friends as to why Roisin wasn’t invited to the lunch which sparked the social media posts.

LAST night, the England team did the unthinkable; they progressed through to the next round of the competition by beating a team in a penalty shoot-out. As such, we have moved the England World Cup Doomsday Clock forward by five minutes to 11:55PM, the closest it has been in decades to 12 midnight, and total England World Cup victory.

Although the chances of England winning the World Cup remains a distant and improbable threat, it would be foolish to not prepare for such an unthinkable scenario. As recent events have shown, this current England squad do not care for people who just want to see them crash out in the knockout stages so that we can all have something to laugh at. Unrest continues to grow in many countries as to what would happen if football does indeed come home, and as such, we have compiled a survival guide for those caught up in the horror of an English World Cup victory:

1) Do not look at the flash

Should Southgate’s men break through the defences put in place to stop them and actually achieve World Cup glory, you will see a bright flash followed by a deafening roar. The flash is caused by millions of English people throwing their arms up in the air at once, causing their jerseys to lift over their white pot bellies, simultaneously reflecting the sunlight and blinding anyone within 5,000 miles. Do not look directly into the flash. Shield your eyes, and hold your nose to avoid being overcome by the ensuing stench of body odour, Lynx Africa, and spilled Carling.

2) Stop, drop, anguish

After England win the World Cup, stop, drop, and wail in anguish. Continue rocking over and back on the ground for as long as you want. The safest place to be in under a table, or under a sturdy door jamb. Keep repeating ‘fuck sake, they’ll be fucking impossible now’ over and over again.

3) Identify England sympathisers

Pro-England sentiment in your country may be stronger than you think. Listen out for traitors who say ‘ah it’s nice for them all the same’ or ‘I’m happy for Southgate’… these people may simply be trying to survive by cosying up to the English by any means necessary, or they may actually be glad that England has won. Either way, they need a kick in the bollocks.

4) Prepare yourself for a World Cup winter.

The resulting fallout of an England World Cup victory will last a minimum of four years, where there is a chance of beating them at the next tournament. This time will be arduous, and like, super annoying. Scientists believe that the smugness from an England World Cup victory may actually cause crops to die in the ground, the sky to darken and the sun to be blotted out. Should England win, there is nothing we can do to prevent this. All we can do is pray it never happens.

5) Oh yeah, take your iodine tablets

They can’t hurt.

A NEW study into the effects of alcohol on ageing and the human body has proven beyond reasonable doubt that drinking on a daily basis reduces the risk of growing old by as much as 68%.

The groundbreaking report followed 5,000 volunteers over a 50 year period with half of the subjects admitting to being daily drinkers, and the other 2,500 subjects never touching a drop of alcohol at all.

“We found that a large majority of those who abstained from drinking ended up growing horribly old and frail,” explained lead researcher Dr. Kevin Thompson, “while the other half lived fun, eventful lives and never really grew old at all, successfully dying before the age of 65, thus avoiding old age”.

Dr. Thompson, who admits to being a daily drinker, hopes the report will change people’s perception of alcohol and take away the stigma attached to people who like a tipple or two every evening before going to bed, stating that his only regret about the find is not doing the study sooner.

“If only I knew about this earlier in my life,” said one teetotaller we spoke to, who was literally kicking himself at the news, “now I’m doomed to grow old and become a burden on my family. And with the way this government treats its elderly, I might as well just take up drinking now, but I just hope it’s not too late”.

A LOCAL WATERFORD man has admitted to deriving an odd satisfaction from driving over already dead animals he comes across when driving across the county’s roads.

Squirrels, birds of all types, rabbits, cats and oh, Jesus even dogs sadly struck and killed by vehicles represent for 36-year-old Matty Hemmings a chance to experience a rare frisson of satisfaction while driving over carcasses.

“I know it’s not normal, but there’s got to be others out there like me,” shared Hemmings, who doesn’t even give a second thought to the possibility of swerving to avoid further embedding fur and guts into the fabric of Ireland’s road networks.

“And anyway, it’s actually dangerous to swerve out of the way of roadkill, you could put other motorists at risk plus you’d miss out on that sweet thud you get when tires meets dead animal,” Hemmings added.

While WWN was loathe to ask more questions regarding the weird practice, journalism doesn’t conduct itself, and so we tried to get further inside the twisted mind of Hemmings, probing what made his tick.

“I don’t like the ones on the motorways, your drive over them too clean with the speed the car is going. Approaching a roundabout is probably my favourite, you’re slowing down, and maybe if it’s freshly dead, you’re really the first to get bumpy passage over the carcass,” concluded Hemmings, who we hope has no children, no friends and no interaction with any other humans.

AN INTERNATIONAL health body has stripped the HSE of its right to call itself a health service in the wake of the CervicalCheck scandal, WWN can reveal.

‘Health service’ a protected title like dietician, solicitor, barrister, or speech and language therapist, can only be used by individuals or entities that meet the required standards and qualifications. However, the International Health Accreditation Body (IHAB) has observed that the HSE has now fallen well short of these requirements and has therefore been stripped of the title.

The HSE, now just known as the E or ‘the Executive’, will see its management continue to slowly drip feed information under duress, with an occasional carefully administered apology from an individual who has recently consulted the terms of his contract with his solicitor to see what words he needs to avoid using so he doesn’t lose his bonus or pension.

“Of course there are so many frontline nurses, doctors and healthcare professionals who continue to deliver first rate care in ‘the E’, but we can only re-award ‘Health Service’ status when those in power stop trying to cover their asses and actually put patients first,” explained a IHAB spokesperson, who admitted the status should have been revoked a long time before the CervicalCheck scandal.

“Funnily enough, a health service is supposed to spend its time striving for the best standard of care for its patients, not using its legal team to try to fight victims or getting people to sign nondisclosure agreements so the public never learns of a scandal,” added the spokesperson.

Elsewhere, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health have pledged to get to the bottom of the CervicalCheck scandal by continuing to dig a hole for themselves.

LOOKING for all possible ways to delay having to come up with her first negotiation position that isn’t built on naivety, ignorance, endless contradictions and a complete lack of understanding, British PM Theresa May has declared Brexit negotiations will have to wait until popular reality TV show Love Island is over.

“The British people will get the Brexit they voted for but I can’t in good conscience pursue the totally brilliant results will we definitely get from the EU while Love Island is still on. Jack and Dani’s relationship must be seen through to the end. Until then negotiations are on hold,” an official press release from May read.

The PM has strongly denied claims that she, along with her cabinet, are so bereft of ideas they are searching for any excuse to avoid accelerating Brexit talks with EU, and that this isn’t just a ploy to delay talks the EU have repeatedly said need to advance quickly.

“Island Loving is my favourite television broadcast programme made for the 16-35 demographic. I, like all Britons, love the show, and have, like them taken the beloved Megan and Adam to my heart,” May explained, struggling to sound human in her speech.

Having failed to deliver a detailed plan for the Irish border which is acceptable to the 27 EU states, May appears to suddenly have found a love for a TV show which still has a number of weeks left on screens before it concludes.

The EU immediately dispatched a team of 30 Love Island experts to London in a bid to use the ‘recoupling process’ on the show as a helpful metaphor for how Brexit should work via an extensive DVD. However, in an effort to press play on the instructive DVD May’s cabinet accidentally threw the television and DVD player into the Thames with 6 ministers each breaking several fingers while trying to use the remote.

BEYONCÉ and Jay Z dropped a joint album much to the delight of music fans around the world, and we’ve got all you need to know about what is surely going to be the most talked about album of 2018.

Has there ever been such a high profile joint-album from stars as big as this? Read on to learn all about how this album came together:

1) Despite the title ‘Everything is Love’ the couple are in fact incorrect. For example a too soft avocado is not love, finding a hole in one or your socks is not love, Dublin Bus real time information stating your bus is due in 4 minutes but it’s already been 17 minutes is not love. The is not a complete list of the many things which are not love.

2) All vocals were recorded from inside the couple’s bedroom during intercourse.

3) The 14 minute accordion solo on Apeshit was played by Tipperary native Tommy Melligan.

4) Pharell produces two tracks on the album, however, he was unable to produce any other songs on the album after getting into a heated argument with Beyoncé over the correct pronunciation of the word ‘squirrel’.

5) The track Boss was written by the couple from the perspective of a 72-year-old Guatemalan woman who has never seen the colour blue.

6) The video for lead single Apeshit features countless notable art work and art references with the video ending with The Carters gazing at a painting called ‘Lady Smile Or Lady No Smile? We Don’t Know. Lady, Why Your Face So Hard To Read?’ by famous renaissance painter Dave Cribbons.

7) Despite drawing strong early reviews, it’s no Love On Top.

8) Inexplicably 47 hedgehogs have been given writing credits on the album.

9) To get the vocal performance right for LOVEHAPPY Jay Z and Beyoncé wore pairs of oven gloves and pretended they were both named Guinevere.

10) Under no circumstances are you to listen to this album if you are wearing tracksuit bottoms paired with a shirt.

HUNDREDS of thousands of news fans braved cold temperatures overnight to secure their tickets for what is expected to be the greatest and most intelligent live stage show of the world has ever seen.

Queues spanning up to four kilometers began building outside Ticketmaster outlets across the country from last week, with desperate fans setting up their camping gear in order to be first in line for tickets when they went on sale at 9am today.

“I had to quit my job in order to get my place in the queue,” one sensible man in his mid to late 20s explained, now wrapping his eyes with bandages, “Waterford Whispers News is the only thing I want to see live this year so I’m going to save my eyes until October 6th in Vicar Street”.

An estimated 670,786 people have so far bought tickets for the amazing show, with queues still causing traffic delays in most city centres across the excited nation.

“I’ve been queuing since last month,” said another teary eyed fan, who is obviously some kind of highly intelligent human being with great taste, “this show will probably change my life and my whole outlook on just about everything I hold dear to my heart. WWN is news”.

Ticket prices for the WWN live show are already changing hands for up to €1,000 each on ebay, with touts expected to make millions of euros on the second hand sale, with Aiken Promotions cautioning fans not to buy tickets via secondary sellers or any unofficial source..

“We have never seen anything like this,” said a spokesman for the promoters, who admitted to underestimating how big a deal Waterford Whispers News is in Ireland, “our only hope now is that we have enough cardboard material to print the tickets on as they are selling out like hot cakes. The whole country seems to be going to this”.

A GROUP of men have issued a gentle reminder today that women are under no obligation to tell them every single detail about their day, despite urges to the contrary.

Donning balaclavas and protective clothing, a handful of brave spokesmen released the statement in an unknown location via a live social media video feed, carefully wording the reminder in a bid not to cause any arguments.

“As much as we absolutely love hearing about your day in work and your lengthy conversations with people we do not know, we would like to gently point out that there is an important match/movie/TV program/news segment/thing we’d also like to see and hear while we try to unwind and relax from the day,” one nervous spokesman read out, flinching slightly as a pen fell to the floor.

“It’s not that we don’t appreciate every single detail of your day and how it made you feel, but if we were to do the same thing to you, the entertainment industry would collapse under the weight of no one watching or clicking on it,” added the men, who hailed from the half of the population famous for only ever saying essential and important things that need to be said.

Following the brief statement, hundreds of thousands of irate comments began flooding the video feeds, forcing the group of men and press to flee.

“How fucking dare they say such a thing,” a top comment read, which gained several million angry emojis in a matter of seconds, “typical pig ignorant men stuff again.

“What’s the point being in a relationship when you can’t divulge every single second of your day?” asked another commenter, who then went on to do just that, “I had to leave work today and nip into Penney’s because the heel of my shoe came off and I had to buy flat ones, but they’re so comfortable. They were only 3 euros. Can you believe that?”

UPDATE: Men have since issued an apology, promising they’ll never do that again.

WITH Pride week over for another year, huge multi-national corporations have begun to rid their branches and their media calendars of pro-LGBT messaging, or indeed anything that vaguely resembles a rainbow.

Originally conceived as a festival of protest to show the gay community’s pride in themselves in a world where they were marginalised and persecuted for their existence, companies have been quick to throw their support behind the festival after realising that ‘hey, gay lads and ladies need mortgages and vodka as well’.

As such, Pride Week, now known as Pride™ Week, has become one of the hottest events on the marketing calendar, with more and more companies doing their best to ‘own Pride’ during June, before getting back to pandering to the straight community for the rest of the year.

“The gay community has fought for generations to achieve equal rights and a safer world to live in, and now that they’ve got all that hard work done as far as we can tell, we can swoop in and stick a rainbow on our logo and try to sell them broadband,” said one executive, totting up how much gay money his firm had made in the last week before deciding whether or not to commit to next year’s Pride budget.

“I think we’re well on the way to Pride being really big, at least as big as say, Electric Picnic. It used to be this little small thing that gays could have full ownership of, and we’re going to do our best to make it just one more drinking session between Paddy’s Day and Christmas. COYBIG, or whatever youse gays say”.

Meanwhile Gardaí have stated that being beaten up during Pride weekend has been downgraded from ‘gay-bashing’ to just ‘bashing’, and that it’s all just a bit of fun anyways.

A NEW study into the effects of alcohol on the human body has unearthed a groundbreaking new find which could change the course of human history as we know it.

Researchers at MIT in America have found that an equal measure of white wine “cancels out” the alcoholic effects of red wine when the white wine is consumed straight after the red, due to a unique chemical breakdown in the stomach.

Following a group of 900 volunteers, the study asked 450 subjects to drink a bottle of red and a bottle of white, but to alternate from one to the other, whereby they would drink a glass of red first, followed closely by an equal measure of white.

“We were surprised to find that of the 450 people, none of them showed any sign of being inebriated,” explained lead researcher Prof. Martin Weisberg, “while the other 450 subjects who drank two bottles of the same type of wine were absolutely plastered and ended up wrecking the testing studio, with a large majority of them later removed for violent and sexual behaviour”.

The news has been hailed by alcoholic treatment groups as a newly found miracle, which could see an end to chronic hangovers.

“We’ve already started handing out free bottles of red and white wine to wine afficianados,” said one wine mixologist, “unfortunately, a lot of them have been swapping the bottles for matching ones because let’s face it, it’s not the test they’re drinking it for, but it’s early stages yet and there will always be teething problems”.

INCOMING GARDA Commissioner Drew Harris is set to sit himself down in front of the TV to watch the Denzel Washington starring ‘Training Day’ movie about a broken police force riddled with corruption in a bid to prepare for his new role.

The tale of a naive police officer being paired with an officer who at first seems well meaning and a straight arrow could provide Harris with the ideal opportunity to be reminded of the fact several senior gardaí may not react well to being told reform and some more reform of An Garda Síochána needs to be undertaken and from a former RUC man no less.

In the film an officer with the best of intentions is embroiled in a corrupt world of aging officers who refuse to give up the questionable ways they administer law and order, with Washington claiming ‘King Kong ain’t got nothing on me’.

While it is not thought the small minority which make up toxic elements of the police force will make any claims about an oversized Hollywood gorilla, Harris could see some obstinate officers refuse to comply with necessary reforms.

Additionally, instead of a daring shoot out in the name of justice which is seen in the climax of the film, Harris’s attempts to triumph will likely result in officers allowed to see out their remaining years and gain a full pension, no matter the infractions committed.

It is believed the government has promised they will root around under some cushions in Leinster House in a bid to find some spare change to fund the upgrade of essential equipment, training and resources needed to protect the public but have asked Harris to make do in the meantime.

THE breakup of former Girls Aloud star Cheryl Tweedy and One Direction member Liam Payne has been met with great delight from noted Waterford harridan Deirdre Moone, who ‘knew from day one’ that the celebrity relationship was doomed to failure.

Payne and Tweedy announced the end of their two-year relationship with a joint statement on social media this morning, causing Moone to almost spit out her tea in the one-bedroom apartment she shares with herself and yell ‘fucking called it’ to nobody.

Moone, 35, chalked up the split as another instance in which she was able to correctly assume that a couple would break up, having correctly guessed such famous splits as Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lopez and Puff Daddy, and the Keenan lad from up the road who was going out with the girl from Spar.

“Have I got an eerie fascination with the misery of others, or have I got an eerie fascination with misery of others?” beamed a jubilant Moone, getting ready to go to work and ‘rub it in the face’ of her co-workers who thought Cheryl and Liam were ‘well suited to each other’.

“Literally from the word go, I knew that this wasn’t two people who had come together and formed a relationship based on love, but just a soulless PR thing cooked up to save their flagging careers. Well, okay, I have no proof that this was the case, but it sure looks like it. Anyways, I’m just made up they’ve broken up. If I can’t find happiness, then no-one can”.

Payne & Tweedy have pledged to do the right thing by their son Bear, who Ms. Moone has described as ‘ a baby with a stupid name’.

A GROUNDBREAKING new surgical procedure has successfully removed a large round gin glass from the hand of one Galway woman, allowing her to post selfies of something other than her with a pint of gin, tonic and ice in her hand.

Oranmore-born Connie Whelan had become hopelessly fused to the glass over the last year, resulting in every photo of her across her social media platforms looking almost exactly the same.

With the glass usually full of needlessly expensive gin, needlessly expensive tonic, needlessly expensive ice and a curl of lime peel which was somehow more expensive per ounce than platinum, Whelan was forced to bring the glass with her to birthday parties, work nights out, 21sts, weddings and christenings, until doctors managed to free her from her affliction.

“We made a series of incisions around the skin where it met the glass” said Dr. Raymond Keane, surgical expert and part-time gin drinker.

“And from there we were able to minimise damage to the hand, while removing the glass intact. It was tricky, and took several hours… she literally fused to the damn thing. Just check out her Instagram if you don’t believe me. Every picture, she’s putting on a brave face, but the glass is there always. She even has up to 230 pictures of her trying to enjoy a night in watching TV with her dog, and there’s the massive glass of gin front and center. Poor soul, it must have been hell”.

Whelan is said to be recovering after her operation, and has vowed to stick to shots in future as the glass is much more discreet if it gets stuck to her hand again.

THE WHITE HOUSE has, on this the day of America’s 242nd year of independence, unveiled a new updated flag which better reflects the nation in its present form, signalling the aspirations it has for its ever bright future.

“Nobody likes change, but we remind people the old flag didn’t always have 50 stars on it, you will grow to love it in time,” a White House spokesperson shared at the unveiling.

The striking update sees prominence given to a religious symbol which denotes peace, something the deeply religious people of America will welcome with Trump devotees already asking people opposing it to try and see things from their perspective. The flag which will be mass produced outside of the United States.

“Our twin pursuits of religious harmony and peace dovetail beautifully, just beautifully really, just as our founding fathers totally wrote about in the Constantinople of the United States of America,” a visibly moved President Donald Trump said as he unveiled a prototype which was designed by the best racially pure artists in the country.

Over the coming hours the new flags will be sent out to public building, schools and local businesses with those refusing to comply with flying the new flag to be sent to a facility were they will relearn what it is to be American.

For some, the flag represents just the latest, seemingly imperceptible change to American freedoms, laws and society which is setting the country on a regrettable path from where it may never return.

“It’s just a flag people,” President Trump said, reassuring his public.

UPDATE: Those who oppose the use of the flag have been asked to register their complaints via website set up by US authorities, making sure to include their address, date of birth, a list of all their relatives, their ethnicity and political allegiance.

SORRY to interrupt your daily browse for fucking blaa recipes and reviews of city hotspots that you can’t possibly afford to ever eat at except for your birthday once a year as a treat, but I have some great news. For me. I’ve sold my share in this hellsite for more money than you plebs can ever dream about.

When a lot of editors and the like are moving on from a publication, they’ll usually write up a summary of how they poured their heart and soul into their work, and how they loved it so much and how great it is to see it become what it is today- LOLZ. Guys I can’t even.

When I started Lovin’ Waterford, I had one thing in mind- get it to the point where an investor would swoop in and offer me a duffel bag full of cash for my end of it.

To get it here, I had to make the site the most can’t-miss destination for all things Waterford. So I went out and hired the best journalists I could find and made sure to keep our content as original and factual and… lads, lads I can’t keep a straight face; I hired a bunch of minimum wage monkeys fresh out of college and paid them fuck all to copy and paste shit they found around the web, while I wrote the odd tirade about Waterford scumbags spoiling my panini by merely existing, and you fuckers just lapped it all up.

So thank you all, for making me one of the richest people in the city right now. I hope you all enjoy my last review. It’s of the taste of my arsehole, I hope you all enjoy kissing it while I find something to spend all this money on. Keep an eye out for my next venture, where I spend another three or four years calling you idiots to your faces before some other investor pays me another few million for that.

Later, morons!

A MEETING of some of the country’s top banking officials today quietly discussed how to launch 100% mortgages again to the Irish public without having any negative feedback, WWN has learned.

Following in the footsteps of British counterparts, Barclays bank, several of the country’s main commercial banking chiefs began brainstorming this morning on how to crowbar in deposit free loans without all the moans.

“We could just offer them 10% cash back,” posed one banker, masturbating furiously under the boardroom table, “oh yeah baby, that’s it – let’s bypass that ridiculous 10% deposit clause that none of these broke fucks can afford, yeah, oh yeah, you dirty cunt of a clause, take that all over your application form”.

Echoing his colleague’s proposal, another masturbating banker suggested introducing a family guarantor to get around the tough restrictions that have been put in place to prevent risky lending.

“Oh, you cunning little guarantor minx, you’re exactly what this housing bubble needs right now to really make it burst all over their stupid faces,” said the now climaxing banker, “those suckers will lap it up like a cat with a saucer of milk,” adding, “they won’t even see it coming and will be the ones left mopping up the mess”.

Finishing the meeting, the bankers shook themselves off before shaking hands on the new proposals.

“See you all again in ten or fifteen years,” they agreed.

CURRENT president of Ireland Michael D. Higgins smirked at reporters earlier today after being asked about potential opponents in a possible presidential election later this year, simply answering ‘let them fucking try’.

D. Higgins, whose 7-year term as Uachtarain comes to an end later this year, is expected to run uncontested for a second term, with most of the political parties issuing their support and only a few begrudging pricks considering stepping forward and running against him.

The beloved president, who has two big dogs that he takes everywhere and is only a wee fella and seems to be fairly gas, expressed an interest in maintaining his presidency until told to do otherwise, laughed off claims that there is anyone in Ireland anywhere near as popular as he is, adding that anyone who comes for the throne ‘better come with a big fucking stick’.

“You come at the D, you best not miss,” strutted Higgins, smoking a massive joint while surrounded by a harem of beautiful naked gaeilgeoirs.

“What’s that David Norris is saying now, that I’m too old to be president? Sorry Dave, can’t hear you over that 6% of the electorate that voted for you last time you put your name forward. Gerry Adams wants to put his name forward? Ask the last Sinn Féin lad that ran against me how that worked out. But seriously, anyone that wants to oppose me, let them. I could do with an excuse for a good session in November”.

Driving home the point that he ‘wasn’t going anywhere soon’, D. Higgins has arranged new renovations and interior decoration work for Aras An Uachtarain to start in late October, a baller move if ever we seen one.

AN American woman who came across a giraffe attacking dozens of leaves with its vicious mouth was commended for her bravery today after shooting the beast dead with a bullet from a gun she shot with her finger.

Tessa Thompson Talley just happened to be passing by Africa when she spotted the black giraffe tearing into the leaves of an innocent tree.

“They say to ‘let nature take its course’,” the brave 37-year-old told WWN, still visibly shaken from the horrific encounter, “I just couldn’t stand by and let it strip down the poor trees like that, it was absolutely disgusting to watch and I couldn’t let it continue”.

Fortunately for the tree, and its leaves, Ms Thompson Talley just happened to have a high calibre hunting rifle in her hand at the time and was able to stop the predator in its tracks with a single shot, before then bravely standing beside the dead leaf-eater for a photograph, which will be used to highlight the dangers of giraffes, probably.

“My only regret is not passing Africa sooner,” she added, “God knows how many leaves were eaten alive – nature can be so cruel sometimes”.

It is understood the 18-year-old, 4,000 lbs giraffe, may have eaten millions of leaves in its lifetime and could have continued doing so for another 7-8 years if it wasn’t stopped.

“No wonder there’s very little growing here with those fucking monsters; I’m doing the place a favour”.

Inspired by her own bravery, Thompson Talley vowed to return to the continent again soon to help other defenceless leaves.

“I suppose sometimes nature just doesn’t know what the hell it’s doing, so it’s down to people like me to fix all that with guns,” she concluded, before shooting some African children for the craic.

IRISH WOMEN undergoing cervical cancer checks will now automatically receive a second, third and fourth test in a bid to avoid having a possible diagnosis missed due to a harmless error that women shouldn’t get needlessly worked up over.

Senior figures in the HSE, allowed only 178 separate scandals per week before the public stops giving them the benefit of the doubt, are in the firing line again after a number of women who were given a cervical cancer check had their cancer diagnosis missed and were subsequently not notified of this fact.

However, in a bid to curb such normal, everyday Irish health service inconveniences for women, a new cervical screening system is to be put in place to bolster the CervicalCheck service which has saved countless lives through screening and early prevention despite the recent controversy.

“We’re just going to do 50 of these tests on each individual to be sure, ‘cus it looks like we don’t have a clue what we’re doing, and when we finally figure it out, we might not tell you,” said one spokesperson, citing the news last week that as many as 442 women affected may not have been informed. The spokesperson then issued the HSE’s template apology statement.

Women concerned they have been affected by the failures in the National Cervical Screening programme have been told to rest easy and take heart from the slow, ineffectual response of the HSE and the government to the controversy.

“If you could just tell that voice in your head to stop spending every second paralysed by fear and anguish, we might get around informing you eventually so really, what’s there to worry about,” explained a spokesperson in charge of the carrier pigeons delivering the news.

The Minister for Health has confirmed that anyone wishing to retake a smear test will be able to so free of charge, however, experts in the HSE have asked these women not to hold their breath while waiting.

A CRACK TEAM of the finest text composers one Waterford woman could assemble have descended upon her Dublin city apartment in a bid to help compose a breezy and non-committal text to a guy she is currently seeing.

Responding to the panicked requests of Waterford born Emily Castle (25), Ciara, Rosie and Paula arrived at a bar in an effort to coin the perfect text that could convey the sort of relaxed and chilled out vibe that only a heavily focus-grouped text composed by 4 adult women can bring.

“I need the text to say ‘I need you’ without saying ‘I need you’ but also like, ‘I’ll be fine without you’ without being heavy on the ‘I’ll be fine without you vibes’,” Castle explained to her friends while unfurling pages and pages of notes.

Cormac Kiloon, the source of the text which proposes going out for drinks on Tuesday, a school night, is believed to be unaware as to why it took Castle 4 hours to respond.

“This is 6th date territory, you don’t fuck about with texts at this crucial stage,” remarked Rosie, a veteran of chilled out banter that doesn’t give off a desperate vibe.

Deliberating the exact cadence and grammar of the response for several hours, Castle’s most trusted text-composer Paula, made a pitch for a simple ‘Ok’ response.

“Not ‘okay’ too casual. Not ‘OK’, what are you screaming ‘I have issues’? Just ‘Ok’, you’re basically saying ‘yes, I agree to drinks’. It’s understated, but it’s just right,” Paula offered before the 4 women crowded around the send button for several minutes before plucking up the courage to press send.

Experts estimate it will be several days before Kiloon texts back, on the advice on his one close female friend, Siobhan.

OKAY so it’s a little late to be looking for studying hacks, but just like when we did the Leaving Cert, we’ve left everything to the last minute to gather up these hacks, apologies.

We don’t need to tell you to stay calm and just let this advice sink in, we know you’re high on Red Bull and panic so look, here goes nothing, just read and use these hacks as applicable:

1) Eat your study notes, books. While we don’t have conclusive scientific evidence to back up the fact that by eating your notes they can become slowly absorbed into your bloodstream and brain, we also don’t have scientific evidence that disproves this so, sprinkle a dash salt on that A4 pad and get munching.

2) Repeatedly state ‘oh my God, I’ve like done no study I’m probably going to fail’ over and over again, like those immensely annoying smart people who utter this phrase all the time but constantly get almost perfect test results. Repeating this phrase could open a magic portal to an alternative dimension in which you transform into one of these people.

3) Call in a bomb threat to your exam hall. Can’t fail if there is no exam. Oh, they’re just moving the exam to another building? Read this sentence from the start again.

4) Cry until someone takes pity on you and just gives you a H1 if it means you’ll shut up and stop crying.

5) Write all your answers for every exam in the extinct language of Babylonian Aramaic. With no one fluent in the language anymore, examiners will just have to take your word for it when you say you got everything right. Important note: begin all discussions with examiners as follows: ‘What is the correct answer?’ once the examiner tells you the correct answer you can then confirm ‘yes, that is exactly what I wrote in Babylonian Aramaic, one H1 please’.

6) Kidnap your exam invigilator’s family, and state you will return them safely once you can be guaranteed access to the internet and a brain that isn’t yours. Fingers crossed you don’t get the one exam invigilator that actually hates their family and wouldn’t mind if they were bumped off.

7) Oh maybe watch another episode of that Netflix show you’ve been binging, it has done wonders for your productivity so far.

DESPITE never ever giving Simon the impression we were anything other than friends (New Year’s Eve two years ago was a one time thing) he’s gone and written us a fucking love song.

Shit, just play it cool, there’s got to be a way to make sure this isn’t a big deal.

Simon, very clearly a long established friend (except for that one time), texted via WhatsApp with an audio message after we went to bed last night which contained a song that rhymed ‘you’ and ‘true’ together far too many times.

Fuckin’ excellent, just what we need, happy fuckin’ days.

Further questions arose when we realised that the way WhatsApp audio messages work – having to hold down a button to audio record – likely meant Simon recorded the song first on some other device then played it into his phone from a stereo or laptop speaker making this whole episode all the more regrettable. This would have taken several minutes to do but at no point did Simon’s ‘what the fuck are you doing dude’ voice make an appearance in his head. This. Is. Not. Happening. Why Simon, why?

“Don’t know why but just wrote a song for you. Here goes nothing, lol” Simon texted. Sorry, no. ‘Here goes nothing’? Here goes having to use the mental gymnastics usually reserved for finding a cure for all known diseases and having to divert that brainpower to coming up with a fucking response that doesn’t mean we’ve to spend the rest of our lives crossing the street to avoid Simon once we see him.

Why did he include all those high notes? Those unnecessary bloody high notes.

We didn’t even know Simon could play fucking guitar. Shit, what if he learned the guitar this just for us? No, worse, what if he roped in his friend to play guitar on it? Like, that means his friend sat there with a straight face and all like ‘yeah this is a good idea Simon’, ‘your friend will be totally bowled over by that verse chorus verse chorus thing you’ve got going on’. Christ. There’s Adele vibes on this song. Simon definitely listened to Adele in preparation for writing this.

Hang on, is this why Simon was so pissed off that the guitar at Gav’s party was left-handed and not right-handed? Was he going to drunkenly sing it in front of a room full of people at 3am? How long have you been planning this for Simon???

Thanks a fucking bunch Simon, we’ve just spent the last 5 hours looking up ‘how to un-blue tick WhatsApp messages you’ve read’ and it can’t be fucking done. Never mind the 3 hours we spent panicking over which subtext-free emoji, which would in no way lead you on, we could use that wouldn’t crush your heart but would at the same time say ‘oh how funny, this was a very funny joke song you wrote, thank you for the joke song that wasn’t serious. What a great friend thing to do, my friend Simon’.

Wait, what if there’s a second song?

WHETHER you’re in a new relationship, just hooking up, or entering the 11th year of your relationship, it’s never too late or too early to establish control in a bid to leave him in no doubt that you’re the one who’s in fucking charge.

Of course a discreet discarding of your tampon is an option favoured by many, but is that really of any benefit to you if you want to establish dominance over your husband, fuck buddy, bae or ‘boo boo’?

Utilise that hardwired irrational fear men have of menstrual blood and use it as a prison to enslave them in. You can slam dunk that tampon into the bin in the kitchen, the bathroom or the bedroom and celebrate like it was a last minute 3-pointer from LeBron James, that’s gonna leave him thinking ‘if she’s this brazen about her cycle, what else is she capable of?’

Make no apologies for your period, in fact, if you leave it nice and visible on top of a healthy bin in need of being taken out, you’re just daring him to pluck up the courage to say ‘what the fuck?’ and we all know he’s not going to do that.

Yesterday’s debate about switching over the TV channel suddenly becomes today’s ‘sure honey, we can watch reruns of Ru Paul’s Drag Race you’ve clearly seen multiple times’ and you can all but guarantee you get first dibs on all food products stocked in your place, his place and/or the home you share.

IN a last ditch attempt to keep his body at a safe and comfortable temperature this evening, local man Colm Woods has resorted to purchasing over 1,000 HB Calippo ice lollies from a local supermarket due to ongoing water restrictions put in place by local authorities.

Speaking from his frosty orange and strawberry flavoured bath, the son-of-two recalled the moment he took matters into his own hand, after unsuccessfully trying to cool down his apartment by opening both the fridge and freezer doors.

“It just didn’t work at all,” Woods explained, now suckling on a Calippo from his bath, while continuously mispronouncing it ‘Callipso’, “I had to do something before I melted in the bleedin’ heat, so I rented a refrigeration truck, headed to the shop and cleaned the place out of Callipsos – best decision I ever made”.

The Dublin man expects to remain in the Calippo bath for the foreseeable future, and has already ordered a fresh batch of orange flavoured ones for tomorrow.

“I’ve been told this weather is going to last the whole week, ” he added, “so I might try an Iceberger bath on Saturday; I hear the calcium in the milk is really good for the skin, sure Cleopatra swore by it!”

UPDATE: Mr. Woods has since been rushed to hospital with brain freeze.

Dear Internet user,

Please read the following open letter carefully, as this is the only correspondence you’re getting from us.

Look at the state of you there you pathetic blubbering mess, worrying about what your technological devices are doing to your life; what information we’re taking, what conversations we’re listening in on, what filth you’ve been pleasuring yourself to. You don’t even know the scale of this thing man: it’s a riddle wrapped up in a mystery, inside an enigma.

All your life you’ve been dreaming of such technologies, being able to see other people across the world on a handheld device, having instant access to billions of libraries of information at your fingertips. This is Star Trek shit right here. But alas, even Captain kirk had data logs.

What? You think communications officer Lieutenant Uhura didn’t have access to his search history, and his propensity for shoving several Tribbles up his anus for sexual arousal? Of course she did. And yes, at least she didn’t sell it to the Klingons, but those were different times, kid. Innocent times. Unprofitable times.

To be honest, you should have seen this coming. Even the advert above this paragraph knows more about you than your family does right now. It’s 2018, hun, where hoverboards were ditched for hover ads. The warning signs were always there; the sudden appearance of adverts for Aran underpants just two seconds after you mentioned how much you liked them to a friend, the push notifications for a popular restaurant in your area, the sudden sound of laughter from your phone when you did something stupid on your own – we’re all watching, man. Watching you. You’re the entertainment now, the subject matter, the consumer machine willing to divulge its darkest secrets to the world. You reap what you sow Captain Kirk, and the world wants to sell you Vaseline. Spread those cheeks nice and wide. Let us in for a good root around, there’s room for all of us up there: Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Tinder, Instagram, Snapchat, fucking Bebo too. We’ll be gentle.

Bottom line here is: you let this happen, chief, so wake up, smell the grounded, Arabian roasted, fair-trade, organic coffee beans being offloaded to you at a 1000% markup. You’re the problem here, not the tools, so go delete yourself if you want to be totally free, and more importantly, please stop annoying us – we’re too busy selling your tastes to care.

Yours Sincerely,

Tech Billionaires.

MISTAKENLY thinking they are in line for some massive bonus, senior HSE management have said they will do everything in their power to do nothing to alleviate the current trolley crisis in A&E which first sneaked up on the health service and the government out of nowhere about a decade or so ago.

“700 plus patients on trolleys is a record and we’re delighted, but imagine if it was 1,000 patients? It just sounds so much better,” explained one senior manager who misread ‘run the health service well’ as ‘run the health service well into the ground’.

With a record number of patients currently on trolleys, a modest portion of the health service budget will be spent on celebrating the milestone.

“We’re probably going to attach a balloon to every trolley, it’ll really lift the spirits of pensioners in A&E who are probably a bit down thinking about how after working and paying taxes for 40 years, this is how their country treats them,” shared one HSE executive, who could barely contain his misplaced excitement.

The continued contrast between Ireland outwardly claiming to be a prosperous, modern nation and its dysfunctional health service which serves up daily indignities to the injured and infirm has given the government pause for thought, and sparked a new focus and determination to solve the problem.

“We decided to gather together experts on health services, experts on patient care, experts in medicine etc and we propose to ask them how to better run the health service. And once they put their solutions on the table we vow to tell them we’ve no money and then just walk away,” a spokesperson for the Department of Health explained to WWN earlier today.

A NEW 4 kilometre long dog lead launched today will let owners walk their pets from the comfort of their own home while still being able to trip up as many people along the way.

Unhappy with shorter models which only let you trip up a handful of pedestrians, the Walker 3000 is a lightweight, carbon fibre cable dog lead capable of taking down an entire street full of people while you sit at home watching TV.

“I don’t know how many times my lead snapped because of idiots getting clothes-lined by my puny 15-meter-long dog lead,” explained dog person James Holden, who has been trialling the new lead on his small dog Benji since March, “thanks to the Walker 3000, myself and Benji can now clothesline dozens of unsuspecting people out walking, without me ever having to look at their stupid angry faces”.

“The carbon fibre lead is perfect for wrapping around people’s legs while Benji crosses their path, forcing them to either trip, or walk around the full length of the lead,” added Holden, who then smiled at the latest tug from the extra long dog lead, “Oh! We got a big one. Hopefully Benji didn’t get too tangled up there. If there’s one thing it’s missing, it’s a GoPro. It would be great to be able to see the people tripping up, instead of trying to judge by the tugs”.

The Walker 3000 also allows dog owners to avoid fouling fines, as they are technically not in the vicinity to pick up the dog poop.

THE IRISH government’s UN charm offensive continues in New York today despite the fact the country has an underfunded police, army and everything else related to the security of the nation, WWN can confirm.

Politely requesting to be allowed attend the cool kids table at the UN where you get to discuss important things like international security, Taoiseach Leonidas Varadkar even roped in famous security expert Bono in a bid to convince international leaders Ireland knows how to properly lock up their bikes among other security things.

“Imagine Ireland on the UN Security Council,” marveled one spokesperson for the Taoiseach, who only speaks for him in an official capacity when he says things that make the Fine Gael leader look good.

“Jesus, it’d be like having the Saudis, the Chinese and the Iranians on the UN Human Rights Council; a complete joke but at least they’re there like,” concluded the spokesperson.

Taking a cursory glance at Ireland’s security credentials, some holding power within the UN were surprised by what they saw.

“Eh, it says here your police cars are falling apart, your ambulances are falling apart, your soldiers sleeps in cars. And your utterly defenceless against, sorry the writing is smudged here, oh yeah, that’s it, defenceless against everything,” one UN mover and shaker said before admitting he’d be delighted to welcome Ireland aboard.

The UN’s Big Person Table For Important Things could see Ireland allowed to attend major discussions on a broad range of topics before being laughed at and vetoed when they made suggestions.

In his final begging to international officials, the Taoiseach stated “please, please, let us on, You have no idea how good this will make me look”.

LOOK, we know you’re busy, and those memes don’t look at themselves so we here at WWN are on hand to help it look like you’re the sort of smart and thoughtful person who reads wordy news pieces dissecting the big events currently affecting the world today and then shares them online, encouraging other people to read them too. Mainly because you want people to think you’re smart, and that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside.

Who needs the hassle of reading these articles, they’re very long. Then having to actually understanding them, the world has too much complex news going on, and finally knowing if you agree with the opinion of the person who wrote it – it’s hard to remember if the internet thinks that person is a visionary polemicist or a piece of shit fraud. So this is where WWN comes in.

We’ve got just the article you need to share so you can bask in the knowledge that if someone in your social circle saw you share it, they’d be all like ‘wow, Dave actually reads about the news and shit like that’. It’s written by that guy who is famous for being pretty smart, but also known for having pretty out there opinions. You remember that viral video of him on some debate show. The article is in that paper that you’re pretty sure aligns nicely with your worldview, whatever that is, and best yet, you’re getting in on the ground level with this think-piece before Ciara from college, who’s always fucking sharing shit like this, shares it first.

You’re going to look pretty intelligent to your social media friends and followers who are equally concerned with presenting a false facade of being constantly engaged in the big issues of the day.

UPDATE: Okay, our bad, turns out that article was actually a thinly based piece about supporting Eugenics and the murder of all minorities and women. It’s time to come clean and admit we sort of just skimmed the headline and the first line before sending it on to you. Our bad.

GARDAÍ have renewed calls for people wishing to inform on neighbours illegally using hosepipes by advising them to call their Garda confidential hotline number when relaying information after a spate of punishment beatings around Dublin this weekend.

The call comes just 24 hours after a Dublin man in his late 50s was dragged from his home and shot twice in the back of the knees by his neighbour, who he had “ratted out” for filling up a small paddling pool for his kids.

“This is just one of dozens of incidents where touts have been dealt with by hose pipe fundamentalists,” explained Sergeant Terry Phelan of Store Street Garda station in Dublin’s city centre, “many of the punishment beatings are followed by “rats out” graffiti tags on the informant’s home, so we would urge people to call our dedicated Freephone confidential hotline on 1800 666 111, and whatever you do, don’t tell anyone you did so”.

Already four kneecappings have been recorded in the greater Dublin area since the hose pipe prohibition was enforced, with some hosepipe abusers hiring underage scouts to watch out for rats or Gardaí, while they continue to ignroe the restrictions.

“I usually charge them a carton of L&Ms,” explained one 13-year-old scout we found on a council estate wall, who launched a red kite into the air upon our approach, “we also use flares and special whistles to alert the hose pipers. The guards can’t touch us, we’re too young”.

Many hose pipe violators have resorted to unique methods in a bid to water their gardens, with one man we found watering his lawn by disguising his pipe with a dildo hanging out of the zipper area of his pants, threading the hose pipe up through his trouser leg.

“People just think I’m pissing,” the man explained, water gushing furiously from his makeshift penis onto some beautifully hydrated geraniums, “few complaints for indecent exposure alright, but sure, people are used to that around here”.

The hosepipe ban is expected to last until 2050.

WILDLY POPULAR game Fortnite has over 125 million players across the world and is obsessively played by its fans. All sounds like a remarkable success story, right? Wrong! If your child is playing it, it is turning them into a psychopath.

Don’t believe us? Well we broke into your house while you were at work to watch your child play Fortnite and he’s fucking crazy, that kid.

Smashing the windows to gain entry to your home because we don’t have a key, the apple of your eye who you think is the bees knees reacted is an aggressive manner, screaming at us to get out. A sure sign that the game he regularly plays, Fortnite, was having a horrible rotting effect on his brain. Have kids no manners these days?

You don’t even have to pay for Fortnite, it’s free, which begs the question is the game just an elaborate mind control experiment by the US military to turn everyone into gun totting psycho killers?

Telling your son to shut his fucking mouth and respect his elders, we tied him to a chair in order to get answers out of him. He was like a rabid dog at this point, he wouldn’t sit still and keep screaming ‘don’t kill me’. It got very annoying, very quickly.

Fortnite Battle Royale is a horribly violent free for all which is addictive and corrodes the brain cells within your son’s noggin, although we’d question if he has any at all. The game certainly doesn’t teach respect, we went to get ourselves a glass of water and the little shit tried to escape.

Would he have tried to escape had he not been playing Fortnite 34 hours a day? Who knows? We do. Of course he wouldn’t, this game is a cancer on everyone.

We didn’t have to wait long for concrete answers as to whether or not your kid was a psycho killer, we had our back turned for like, two seconds, and he freed himself and called the police.

When we lunged for him to try and teach him a lesson he instinctively protected himself (Fortnite corroding his brain again?), he pushed us away, forcing us to stumble and bash our head on your lovely kitchen island (by the way where did you get that marble top finish done, it’s lovely).

We have to admit to being shocked by just how much humans bleed, like how is there that much blood in the human body, seriously? After losing consciousness we awoke in hospital with police surrounding our bed, presumably guarding us for our own safety from your feral son. This is the violence Fortnite can cause. We were violently attacked when just going in search of simple answers. Parents be aware.

Spain have been dumped out of the World Cup after losing to the hosts Russia on penalties. Russia equalised in the 41st minute through a Dzyuba penalty after Gerard Pique’s arm, which he raised above his head in a bid to ask the referee a question about handball rules in football, was struck by the ball.

What followed enraged the head of Russia’s expert doping team as it became clear that with Spain aimlessly passing sideways for the next 80 minutes, there was no real need to inject the Russia team with performance enhancing substances.

The Spanish FA have said the surprise defeat will force them to reevaluate their tactics, investing in research to see if passing the ball forwards instead of sideways can lead to goals.

The first of two penalty shoot outs yesterday saw goalkeepers emerge as the heroes with Russia’s Igor Akinfeev making the decisive save from Iago Aspas’ penalty.

In the aftermath of the save Akinfeev admitted his karate kick save was down to watching the Karate Kid 7,248 times as a child finally paying off, with the Russian FA stating watching the illegally doping scenes in Rocky IV also inspired them.

Akinfeev’s dive to his right saw him save the penalty by kicking the ball which was making its way down the middle of net, sparking wild celebrations all over Russia and giving football fans everywhere the sinking feeling that comes with knowing they’re going to win this bloddy thing, aren’t they?

Spain’s hypnotic back and forth passing left many people watching the game in a trance like state, but left others like your Dad, cursing at the TV demanding football stop being so boring and monotonous.

The second game of the day between Croatia and Denmark thundered into life with 2 goals in the opening 4 minutes. Denmark’s opener came courtesy of Zanka and a long throw in, which under FIFA rules, is still illegal to defend against without panicking and flailing around the place.

Croatia’s equaliser came from Mario Manzukic and was a lovingly recreated homage to a pinball machine on speed.

The game then fell into a less frantic pace and only sparked into life once more in the dying minutes of extra time – after Danish defender Zanka hauled down Rebic in the box a penalty was given.

Denmark’s keeper Casper Schmeichel saved Luka Modric’s penalty after taking inspiration from Russia’s annexation of Crimea by encroaching over a line he is not allowed cross and stepping into territory that wasn’t his.

The problem of keepers jumping forward off their lines during penalties has seen a number of proposals made by FIFA to combat the issue such as gluing keepers to the goal line, threatening their loved ones at gunpoint in the box, and referees actually following the rules and booking keepers and forcing a retake.

Rakitic scored the winning penalty for Croatia after heroics from his teammate Subasic in goal however, huge credit must go to Croatia’s captain and talisman Modric.

Having missed a penalty earlier, Modric stepped up again and scored, with scientists estimating he has balls in excess of the size of a small African republic.

Today’s games see Brazil take on Mexico and Belgium and Japan. A prize will be given to a fan whose blood pressure skyrockets the most while watching Neymar dive on the pitch and writhe around in faux agony.

Elsewhere, FIFA President Gianni Infantino was pictured sitting next to Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, probably discussing how all profits from FIFA’s operations should go into the pockets of football impoverished countries as his pockets simply no longer have the room.

A JACKED UP Ryan Tubridy has spoken for the first time of how his new exercise routine has transformed his life and taken his presenting skills to the next, never before thought possible, level.

The ease and charm with which Tubridy regularly carries out interviews with Ireland’s leading lights is an integral part of the continued success of RTÉ’s Late Late Show, however, as audiences continued to tune in, Tubridy saw the need for improvement.

“You’ve got to stay on top of your presenting game, and this new regime has helped me unlock new ways of visualising questions for the guests,” Tubridy said while in the midst of bench pressing 170kgs.

Tubridy fans will have been surprised by his recent appearances on the Late Late before it broke for the Summer as he can be seen visibly bursting out of the seams of his shirt and suit, his burgeoning muscles hard to contain.

“I’m in a new zone, on a new plain of existence and the clarity of mind one gets from doing 1,000 squats a day is like nothing I’ve ever experienced before. Never skip leg day, never skip interview preparation,” Tubridy adds, enthusiastically, and the results are clear.

While not meaning to question the interview technique Tubridy has unleashed on celebrities and people of note, he is the first to admit that his last 17 interviews with Nathan Carter on the previous 4 episodes of the show have lacked ‘something’.

“Before I hit the weights hard, I just think maybe the likes of Nathan weren’t getting the best questions I knew I had deep within me,” Tubridy explained, and recent footage of Carter being asked by the host what his favourite colour is certainly shows a new, steely-eyed focus that may have been lacking.

The 45-year-old’s office in RTÉ is a sea of whey protein tubs, with the host making his way through several a day while also listening intently to the Joe Rogan Experience podcast during workouts.

Consuming 12,000 calories daily, and somehow fitting in 8 gym sessions into his busy working routine, Tubridy has never been better, but there have been drawbacks.

“I keep ripping doors clean off their hinges when I go to open them, we’ve had to replace 48 of them in RTÉ studios this week alone, I’m still getting used to the new guns”.

THE NEW revamped Dublin Bus service which will see a quicker more efficient transport network serve the city with a more efficient fare system being introduced without any hiccups whatsoever, if previous experiences of big public projects in Ireland is anything to go by.

Now that the plan, long needed and proposed after consultations with leading international experts in city transport systems, is set to be implemented it is presumed absolutely no one will object or stonewall the introduction of a new era in Dublin transport.

The proposals will absolutely not be derailed by a local politician kicking up a fuss and forcing changes because he wants to win some pensioners votes in his area.

“This will transform Dublin’s transport network and potentially benefit the vast, vast, majority of Dubliners but obviously it’ll never happen because the drivers will strike wanting more pay, someone will challenge it all the way to the High Court, and ans endless string of TDs will be acting Billy the big bollocks hoping to get a bus stop moved 4 inches to the right,” explained one expert we spoke to.

Many commuters have also complained over the news that in order to get from A to B they may have to switch buses, with many more stating ‘no, I don’t like that’ after learning the number bus system will change to lettered buses such as route A, A1, B and B1.

“It’s shit like this is why we can’t have nice things,” confirmed the transport expert after learning of the 23,345 formal complaints from people who don’t use the bus and haven’t read the proposals.

Dublin Bus confirmed no matter the advance in bus technology or changes in the transport network your bus will be stuck at ‘5 minutes’ on the real time notification system.

THE TAOISEACH Leo Varadkar has hit out at the media, bemoaning the horrible reality that, as magnaminous leader of the Irish people, he is only fawned over by the media 23 and a half hours a day, every day of the week.

Sharing his sympathies with the struggles US president Donald Trump has had in battling with the ‘enemy of the people’, Varadkar criticised the Irish media when attending a private function in New York, which was part of Ireland’s push to join the UN Security Council. A push which every Irish media outlet attended, regurgitating every soundbite Varadkar and his Communications Unit had to utter.

Varadkar, who’s hole only remains unlicked by the media for a very small portion of the average 7-day week, could have had his nose put out of joint after he was asked about his party’s arrangements in the Dáil with convicted criminal Michael Lowry by the Irish media.

“Come on guys, you know the drill. What did we practice? ‘Leo is young, dynamic, openly gay, socially progressive, half-Indian, fit, handsome and a God. It’s all Fianna Fáil’s fault, spit on Sinn Féin’. Okay, one more time folks,” one Government spokesperson said to a group of journalists who had momentarily escaped a pen in which they reside and regularly lick the Taoiseach and his party’s hole from.

With absolutely no evidence at present of a housing, health or homeless crisis currently in Ireland, it is easy to understand why the Taoiseach was so shocked any media outlet could find fault with his continued existence as Ireland’s saviour, and this is not the first time the media has been so mean and unfair to him.

“What next from these horrible evil bastards, are they going to tell us that vermin who don’t get up early in the morning are real people too?” asked one spokesman for the Taoiseach who doesn’t speak for the Taoiseach.

A COUNTY Waterford cyclist who was spotted travelling on the Tramore to Waterford road wearing an aerodynamic helmet thinks he’s a fucking pro or something, concluded absolutely everyone who witnessed the man in transit.

Cycling with his head down on the handlebars in a bid to “limit the drag”, trainee accountant Stephen Power managed to shave a staggering 4.3 seconds off his commute to work, much to the amazement of anyone willing to care.

“It used to take me 32 minutes and 12 seconds to get in,” a rather chuffed Mr. Power told some guy he doesn’t know at the printer this morning, “now it takes 32 minutes and 7.7 seconds, so I’m probably a little early now that I think about it.

“I don’t know what to do with myself with all this free time,” he said, adding, “it was well worth the €499”.

The son-of-two has already gained notoriety among his cycling peers who also travel the same route to work every morning, gaining the nickname ‘Flash Prick’ for his regular overtaking.

“He’s some fucking dose,” explained one man who takes 4 minutes longer than power to cycle the same distance on his mountain bike, “he’s not even going that fast and takes an awkward amount of time trying to overtake other cyclists – it’s like he’s really trying to race everyone else on the road.

“Cop on to yourself boy! No one fucking cares about your stupid helmet,” he advised.

Despite his elaborate spending on cycling gear, Mr. Power is not expected to race professionally anytime soon, due to a “dodgy knee that ruined his career”.

ARE you trying to either get your ideas across, complete complex tasks, dictate or discuss things with subordinates, peers and superiors or as it is otherwise referred to as ‘doing your job’?

And are you a woman? Right, well, buckle up because you’re clearly being difficult and a little bit shrill if we’re being honest. This is just nonsense, right on the money, life advice, so don’t get too catty okay?

If you don’t want to be labelled a difficult woman then you’re going to want to listen up. It’s far easier than you’d think, which will come as a relief since you’ve enough on your plate at the minute what with the day job.

Okay, deep breath, eyes open, ears on, brain activated: you’re less likely to be viewed as a so-called difficult woman if you just got on with your job like men do.

Do exactly as they do, and there’s not a chance you’ll be stuck with being a difficult woman. What you’re failing to understand is that when someone, and when we say someone, we mean women, get a rep as a difficult woman it’s because they’re being difficult. No other reason.

If you’re asserting yourself at work and that sort of label or remark follows you around you’re obviously being too difficult or not asserting yourself a normal way a man, who is not a difficult woman, would.

We hope that helps.

Also that suggestion Mick gave at the meeting today was really good, and it’s not helpful when you say it’s something you’ve been suggesting for months.

Undoubtedly the biggest story of the tournament so far, the holders Germany crashed out of the World Cup with a loss to South Korea, a team who didn’t seem to be aware of the fact that it’s written in FIFA rules somewhere that Germany must get to at least the semi-finals of every World Cup.

The afternoon fixtures had fallen into a similarly boring pattern of the dire France v Denmark game until Sweden scored against Mexico, and Germany continued to insist on playing in slow motion against their opponents thus setting themselves on a collision course with football fans’ schadenfreude.

Mexico meanwhile were doing their best to throwaway the chance of playing in the knockout stages by losing 3-0 to Sweden, TV cameras showed Mexican fans in the crowd going through the 7 stages of grief before adding another 56 stages to the process as they watched on, contorted in horror before the final whistle brought news that ‘holy shit, the Germans bottled it’.

Mexico’s bacon tacos were saved thanks to a truly awful German performance which concluded with Manuel Neuer, regarded by many as the best sweeper keeper in the world, galavanting upfield with the ball before displaying the sort of deft touch more closely associated with Harvey Weinstein.

TV viewers criticised the live feed of the game, stressing there wasn’t enough close ups of German player’s faces drowned in anguish at the full time whistle.

The evening kick offs would have a hard time matching the high drama of the afternoon but the evening did bring another example of a Brazilian side growing in confidence.

British diving sensation Tom Daley has named Neymar as his new technique coach as he bids for gold in Tokyo 2020.

After completing more rolls than a Cuisine de France production line, Neymar finished on the winning side as Brazil beat Serbia 2-0 to top their group.

The other evening’s game saw Switzerland advance after drawing with Costa Rica. Obviously no one watched this match, but look it finished 2-2 all, that’s your summary done there.

Over on RTÉ’s pundits Damien Duff, Keith Andrews and Richie Sadlier struggled to properly analyse all 47 of Neymar’s dives as the impressive big screen they stand around didn’t work properly. It is believed the issue was caused when RTÉ diverted all power to the RTÉ Player so viewers on the app could watch the coverage in lowest definition picture quality available, similar to those dodgy DVDs of films clearly filmed on a Nokia 3510 in an Indian cinema somewhere.

BBC pundits relished in Germany’s demise in the way Irish football fans have relished in the demise of England at every major tournament since 1966. Whereas obviously Ireland do it in a carefree and nonchalant fashion that doesn’t have a shred of bitterness to it, when coverage went back to the studio a visibly erect Gary Lineker had to be held down by security in order to prevent him from masturbating with delight live on TV.

Elsewhere, it’s all kicking off on Love Island.

Else, elsewhere, FIFA president Gianni Infantino has appealed to people delivering payments under the table that they don’t literally have to be delivered directly to him when sitting under an actual table. They can just be wired to a secret account FIFA’s accountants should have forwarded onto you already.

REACTING to continued reports that a hosepipe ban is set to stay in place for the coming days and Ireland could experience dangerously low water levels, one local man is leaving his kitchen sink tap running out of pure spite.

Dublin native Damien Chappins, who has never taken well to being told what to do, was earlier outraged at news the hosepipe ban meant he couldn’t wash the car he has owned for 5 years and never washed once.

“Typical government or gardaí or whoever it is, telling me I can’t use my water. The pricks,” Chappins explained as he took an inordinately long time washing his heads at the sink before ‘forgetting’ to turn off his tap and returning to his sitting room.

“The neck of people telling you what to do with your water when there’s oceans full of the stuff out there,” Chappins added, who has in the last 24 hours upped his drinking of tap water from ‘never’ to ‘8 litres per hour’.

Denying he is one of countless weirdos who when told he can’t do something, immediately wants to do it, whatever it is, more than any other activity in the world, Chappins defended his actions.

“I’m telling ya, no other eejit is listening to them instructions so if I want to leave a tap running because I’m spiteful and am never quite sure why I’m so angry, I’ll do it,” Chappins explained while washing the same mug for a 12th time today.

Experts in the behaviour of Chappins have confirmed that were the country to experience the complete gutting of its water supply, he would be first in the queue to give out about there being no water thanks to selfish bastards who don’t heed warnings.

“The list of fucking people responsible for this fucking heinous debacle needs to be on our fucking desk by midnight, as they need to be fucking fired immediately,” the Nation explained to the government, making it abundantly clear the usual mealy mouthed apology tour favoured by politicians and state bodies such as the HSE will not be accepted in relation to the CervicalCheck scandal.

With news that there are now another 1,500 cervical cancer cases which have not been audited, the Nation also added that inquiries which just delay information and answers by bogging things down in the gridlock of hearings for the next decade will not be tolerated either.

“The individuals at fault know who they are and they needn’t think they are delaying justice for these women a second longer by letting this all be dragged out of them in a lengthy inquiry. Those who know they’re culpable can save us some time and offer themselves up to be fired, and don’t think we won’t be standing right here waiting until they do,” a determined public added through its gritted teeth.

“And we’ll just presume the Gardaí have begun their investigation,” the Nation added, very matter of factly.

While the public has always made allowances for the frontline staff of a beleaguered health system ravaged by cuts, and held together by duct tape, the time for such sympathy is now officially over.

“If you’re telling us the people responsible don’t know full well what they’ve done, or the role they played in all this, then you can add your fucking names to the list as well,” the Nation pointedly told the government, who were also told a token scapegoat is no use this time, the whole ‘damn culture of apologies in exchange for bulky bonuses and pensions is long fucking over’.

The Nation, on a fucking roll now, pointed out the CerivcalCheck scandal which saw women remain unnotified of inaccurate tests which stated they did not have cancer, will not be solved by the government cynically positioning female TDs in front of the Taoiseach in the Dáil as he issues his apologies.

“Yeah, we see right through that fucking bullshit too. Names. By midnight. Or you’re out on your fucking ear too”.

ARE you human? Yes? Great! Then you are one of the billions of biological entities accessing the world wide web that are not robots, and thanks to a brand new clever Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHYA) system, you will never be mistaken for one again.

For centuries CAPTCHYAs have safeguarded the human race accessing important internet web pages, with the ancient Egyptians using jumbled up lowercase and uppercase hieroglyphics to first detect non human entities attempting to access their important scrolls/tombs.

If it wasn’t for CAPTCHYAs, the world that we live in today would be a totally different place, probably run by robots, if indeed existing at all.

Most CAPTCHYA’s used today request that you partake in an online test, mainly picking out road signs or house numbers from a series of squared pictures, which are usually a cache of unprocessed photographs from crime scenes that would normally have to be labelled by trainee police, thus solving two jobs in one go: identifying you as a human, and vital photographic evidence for criminal court cases.

However, a brand new system has now been unveiled, and could eradicate evil robots once and for all, simply called ‘The DNA CAPTCHYA’.

Launching in October this year, internet users will soon be free from worry as they will be asked to provide a cheek swab laced in their own DNA when they wish to sign an important form or checkout cart in an online shop.

“It will only take a few days for the results to come back,” inventor of the new system Dr. David Woodstein explains, “not only that, but it is 100% foolproof, and we expect to see a massive decline in the number of robots pretending they are humans online, which could see robots extinct by 2019”.

All DNA swabs must be carried out by a fully trained practitioner and kits are expected to go on sale for as little as €99.

Feast/Mint Feast

Feasts are the workhouse of the lolly world – solid, dependable, could possibly pull a plough.

586,586,,"HOLA! I’m footballing legend Diego Maradona and here is my guide to having a few friends round for a quiet evening with cheese, pleasant conversation and ‘wine’.

Step 1: Supplies

Make sure you have plenty of ‘wine’. Get the good shit, nothing that’s been mixed with anything. Put your ‘wine’ merchant’s number on speed dial. You don’t want to run out of ‘wine’.

Step 2: Preparation

Loosen up with a couple of ‘glasses’ of ‘white wine’ before your guests arrive. Start getting out the cheese and biscuits but decide to do it later and have some more ‘wine’ instead.

Step 3: Greet your guests

Invite your guests in and get them some ‘wine’. Ask whether you should put a couple of pizzas in the oven. Don’t worry if no one is interested – they’re probably just saving room for the ‘wine’.

Get an interesting conversation going – for example, everyone repeatedly saying, “Fuck, this is good ‘wine’!”

Step 4: Listen to deafening rock music

The best music for an evening of cheese and ‘wine’ is 1980s rock turned up to maximum volume. The power chords and macho posturing sound great after you’ve done lots of ‘wine’.

Step 5: Threaten your neighbours

At this point your neighbours may complain because you’ve been listening to Livin’ on a Prayer on repeat for several hours. Threaten them with a firearm and calm your frayed nerves with a large glass of ‘wine’.

Step 6: Deal with the police

By now your neighbours have probably called the police. Have another ‘glass of wine’ and barricade yourself inside the house.

Step 7: Tidying up

There’s nothing worse than waking up to a mess after a gathering, so flush all your ‘wine’ down the toilet before the police smash the door in and turn your house upside down.

And that is how to have a wonderful evening with nothing stronger than a glass of ‘wine’.",Diego Maradona’s guide to having friends over for ‘wine’,http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/sport/diego-maradonas-guide-to-having-friends-over-for-wine-20180628174693,www.thedailymash.co.uk

Dear Sir,

Have you used up any of your dead grannies yet? As far as my teacher is concerned, both my grannies have died three times each. I usually reserve a dead granny for something really critical like a missing big piece of coursework, or sports day when I have to do the 1,000 metres. For smaller pieces of work I tend to use pet based examples: my granny’s dog Bilko has done a poo on several pieces of maths homework and my guinea pig also once shredded my essay on the water cycle because he has mental health issues. Tomorrow I have to hand in my tree diary that I was supposed to keep over the summer holidays. Unfortunately I was too busy hanging out in McDonalds everyday so I’ll be explaining to Mrs Dodkins that the tree was cut down out of respect for my poor granny, who was chased up it by an angry squirrel and subsequently fell to her death. Consequently, my diary only has one, heartbreaking entry, detailing the entire tragic episode. Genius, I know.

Hope that helps!

Bradford said: “Tom’s always telling me he loves me and sees a future together – just like Wes did before he ditched Laura for the first pretty girl to give him some attention, the bastard.

“I just can’t believe Tom would do that to me. After five years together I thought I knew him, but now I’ve realised what a lying scumbag he really is.”

Logan attempted to defend his feckless behaviour which was not actually done by him.

He said: “I think it’s safe to say I didn’t cheat on Emma with Megan because I’m not some random twat on a bullshit ITV2 reality show taking place thousands of miles away.

Being stupid alone wouldn’t do it. And the just plain greedy often have a measure of cunning that rules them out. No, deals like this are reserved for people like me who are that winning combination of both.

And when, a year down the line, I discover that a deal that was too good to be true was, in fact, neither good nor true? I won’t blame myself.

Here is a list of the discretionary spending on EU officials in 2014 and found how EU officials are often living a life of luxury at our expense. This included trips to luxury resorts, flights on private jets and Caribbean cruises.

Commenting, Priti Patel MP said:

‘This is how EU officials are spending your money. The complete lack of transparency in the EU means that Eurocrats think they can get away with living the high life at our expense. They have tried to hide this spending for years.

‘Most families have been hit hard since the financial crisis, having to tighten their belts to make ends meet. But EU officials are using our money to fund their jollies and exorbitant expense claims.

‘The only way to stop your money being spent in this way by EU bureaucrats is to Vote Leave on 23 June. If we leave the EU we can take back control of the £350 million a week we send to Brussels and instead we can spend it on our priorities like the NHS.’

Some of the worst examples include:

Private jets – EU officials spent €439,341 on Luxaviation, a luxury private jet provider, which offers a choice of 250 private jets, wines from their own extensive cellar, on board culinary facilities and uniformed hostesses.

Methodology

The European Commission’s Financial Transparency System (FTS) allows users to search for the beneficiaries of funding from the Commission directly (since 2007) and beneficiaries of the European Development Fund (since 2010). It is intended to comply with EU law which requires that ‘the Commission shall make available, in an appropriate and timely manner, information on recipients, as well as the nature and purpose of the measure financed from the budget’. However, it appears to be deliberately designed to frustrate investigators, with examples of lavish expenditure hidden away under innocent sounding headings, such as ‘communication’. For instance, you can find expense claims for cruises logged under ‘environment’.

As expenditure is often hidden away under misleading headings, it is often extremely difficult to navigate. For 2014, the last year that figures are available, we were able to identify EU officials spending taxpayers’ money on the following items/services:",Scandalous Expense Claims by EU Officials Uncovered,http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/19502-eu-spends-money-scandalous-expense-claims-eu-officials-uncovered.html,www.dailysquib.co.uk

As paramedics carried the Daily Squib fan to the hospital on a stretcher, he begged his friends to keep on reading satirical articles for him, according to a report on Chinese media.

The man, Long Tam Rei Ding, 23, allegedly started reading the Daily Squib from the evening of January 27 until his friends called for an ambulance in the afternoon of January 28.

According to Chinese news site QQ.com, Long Tam Rei Ding was trying to go to the toilet when he realised he couldn’t move the lower part of his body at an internet cafe in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province.

One of his friends, who was at the scene, was quoted as saying: ‘It seems he had lost sensation completely, and couldn’t move at all. The only thing he had was a huge erection that would not go down. The medic called it a priapism or something. We had to call for an ambulance.’

It remains unclear what article the man had been reading at the time.

A video shows the man’s friend and paramedics working together to move the man from a chair to a stretcher.

The man is reportedly under hospital observation.

Satire Addiction

Satire addiction has become a prominent societal issue among the young people in China, with an increasing number of young people choosing to ignore their studies, social lives and family to surf the web for quality satire.

Last October, a 21-year-old woman in China became blind in one eye after reading Daily Squib articles on her mobile phone non-stop for six days. She was thankfully cured after the doctor told her to read the Squib for a further six days with her remaining eye. Sadly she now cannot close her eyelids and has a permanent stare dubbed the ‘1000 mile Squib stare’.",Man is PARALYSED from the Waist Down Following Nonstop 20-Hours Reading Daily Squib Binge,http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/27230-man-paralysed-waist-following-nonstop-20-hours-reading-daily-squib-binge.html,www.dailysquib.co.uk

The vistas of the city and its renowned architecture will satisfy the attendees from the delicately decorated roof gardens where we will convene after the meetings in the evening.

To say it is a great honour to be invited would be an understatement, but after our recent Kissinger interview it was somewhat expected.

At the moment, I’m trying to figure out what to take in my little bag (not the old lady) to the luxurious hotel we have been booked in. Sorry mes amis, but I cannot divulge the location, but will give you a few tips. It is relatively close to the Royal Palace, and a 5-minute walk from Piazza Vittorio Veneto, it is however near a grotty shopping centre, not that delegates will do much walking.

As with regulations, on pain of death, I cannot say much more.

All this tosh about groups of young ladies being escorted into the rooms is something I can say does not happen. You only get to choose one or two for the night, not more than three much to my chagrin, and there is a pecking order, hopefully no sloppy seconds or thirds.

George ‘7 Jobs’ Osborne and other Remoaners will be attending, they seek to fight the populism encroaching on their territory, and I will be the dissenting voice of reason to their avarice and greed.

The food presented to the delegates will no doubt be something to be savoured. Last time I was in Turin I thoroughly enjoyed the Piemonte cuisine, especially from a restaurant situated within the grounds of Rivoli castle itself, yes it only has a single Michelin star, but the food was unspeakably agreeable to my palate. The Fassona fillet is certainly one reason to get back there, you can practically die for such delights.

According to Hollywood sources, Kelly Osbourne’s boyfriend suffered multiple broken bones and internal injuries when Kelly Osbourne accidentally rolled over in bed and crushed his body.

“The boy only has a very slight frame, so when Kelly rolled over in bed during her sleep she did not realise what she was doing. It was only when the maid came to clean the room in the morning that Mr Squirrel was discovered passed out underneath Ms Osbourne. He was immediately airlifted to Cedars Sinai Hospital for immediate emergency treatment,” Ms Osbourne’s spokesman told ABC news.

Mr Squirrel is still in Intensive Care with over 15 broken bones, a crushed torso resulting in extensive kidney and liver damage and a cracked pelvis.

Doctors at Cedars Sinai have revealed that Mr Squirrel is still in traction and may be in hospital for the next three months depending on how he responds to treatment.

Kelly Osbourne made a brief statement at the hospital today: “We’ve been going out for a f*cking year now and I can’t f*cking believe my f*cking luck.

Theresa May frankly is not capable of negotiating her way out of a paper bag let alone a proper Brexit as voted by 17.4 million people. Concession after concession has left the government with no negotiating power with Brussels, and is now swamped not only by the House of Lords, but by traitorous Remainer MPs on the Soros payroll.

These greedy treacherous swine Haw Haw Remainers, who are willing to betray Britain for a few quid are vile miserable creatures only fit for the stocks, to be displayed to all and sundry as rotten tomatoes and excrement are thrown at their ugly putrid faces.

The devil’s daughter has thus spawned another batch of slimy eggs from her overworked puckered anus, as she delivers another Remainer plot to derail Brexit with a disgusting squishy popping sound. Soubry, a militant treasonous satanic witch deserves only one thing, to be punted full force in her grime box.

Maybe it is time to punish the useless Conservatives once and for all. No one dared to oust the pigeon liver’d lying coward with no backbone May, even though she has shown countless times to be a retrograde abhorrent Remainer not worthy of a squirt of piss from a pig’s straining bladder.

Punish them – Vote Corbyn

Vote for Jeremy Corbyn. Never vote for the Tories again. Yes, this would be the ultimate punishment not only for those who messed up a clear and easy opportunity to leave the EU once and for all but for the country which will fall into deep economical malaise once Agent Cobb begins his Bolshevik revolution.

To coin a Burke cliche, ‘All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.’ Certainly, this has been the case. Where was Boris? He jibber jabbered but did nothing apart from tout useless bridge projects across the Irish sea. Same goes for the Reese-Mogg, IDS and Farage, and Gove, and Davis. They were all talk but no substance, they blabbered like little old ladies around a knitting circle but did fuck all. You Sirs, with the utmost disrespect have been useless, because Theresa May is still PM, and she has fudged the whole Brexit debacle into a maelstrom of unworkable manure, a quagmire of intersecting Remainer plots all culminating at the Remainer Treasury held by that glib fustilarian miserable wart, Hammond.

Let us all now vote for Jeremy Corbyn, the ultimate insult to the nation, and deserved punishment that will destroy Britain forever. Let the riots begin, from town to town, rubbish stacked high in the streets, discontent, looting and anarchy.

662,662,2018-06-26 10:00:49+01:00,"Hollywood celebrities have their moments and these come and go for the fickle starlets, where everything is given to them on a platter at the click of a finger.

We had the adoption craze, and even one where celebrities kept dung beetles as the latest must-have pet.

The latest craze is somewhat topical, as it relates to the Obama era policy of putting South American illegal migrants in cages at the U.S. border.

Charlie Sheen now likes to spend weeks in a cage four feet across in a darkened room with only a box of cigarettes to accompany him and a pot of rancid water.

Speaking from his cage in his Hollywood mansion, Sheen was eager to reveal the benefits of the new craze amongst celebrities.

“I feel like I’m a kid who just walked across the border from Guatemala. It makes me proud to be American, because I not only feel at one with the United States, and Obama who started this practice, but I feel like a lost kid. Like I sit in the corner like this, I cry out for my mama and suck my thumb. I even have a blanket, although I burned some holes in this one with cigarette ash. I feel safe here. I don’t wanna get out.”

Another celebrity who has adopted the cage life is Danny Devito, who sits in his cage and even wears a nappy.

“I asked Arnie the other day if he wanted to join me in my cage. He said no, because he could not even fit his leg in it. They (Devito’s Mexican servants) cart me around the house in my cage, and they feed me burritos through the little hole. It makes me feel good as a liberal champagne socialist to be treated like those kids at the border, like I can atone for my liberal values by sitting in this cage and receiving the same punishment those poor Mexican bastards receive at the border.”

There have been accidents though, and one celebrity did not fare too well whilst in her cage.

Roseanne Barr tried out cage life after being barred from her own show because she uttered a few words on Twitter that were deemed racist.

“They (the producers of her show) actually put me in the cage without my consent. Then they started making ‘Ook ook’ noises to show me what it feels like to be on the receiving end of racism. I cried and cried, but they still did not give me my own show back.”

As for actor Peter Fonda, his latest hobby is not so much centred around a cage but an echo chamber.

663,663,2018-06-28 09:45:26+01:00,"Less than a week after President Trump sought to dispel public outrage by signing an executive order ending the practice of separating children from parents illegally crossing into the U.S., there has been a second—altogether unexpected backlash—from the kids themselves.

Abe Moskowitz, a lawyer for six-year-old Emanuel Honduro Gonzalez, claims that once his client was reunited with his parents “he went into a full blown panic.”

Emanuel was apparently having the time of his life in the cage. “Kids to befriend, an array of toys, plus state-of-the-art air-conditioning.”

Moskowitz went on to point out that Emanuel’s situation certainly beat “trekking across the infernal 140 degree Arizona desert with only cactus needles as sustenance.”

Emanuel’s reaction is in no way unique. Indeed, CNN has reported hundreds of cases of kids “kicking and screaming” and “throwing toys at I.C.E. members” once confronted with the crushing reality that they would be reunited with their parents.

Analysis

Psychologist Amanda Beasley, a professor at Yale University, explained it this way. “A child under the guidance of his parents is actually a thousand times more imprisoned than a child in a cage.”

Beasley went on to suggest that “real individuation must start early—perhaps even a few weeks after the child is expelled from the womb.”

Social Worker, Zeke Thomas, however, has a different point of view.

“These kids are suffering from a cage-based version of Stockholm syndrome. The allure they have for their cages simply makes no rational sense!”

Complicating matters further, many parents are reacting in unexpected ways to seeing their children again.

Gloria Espinoza, a mother from Honduras, started feeling despondent and had to go on Lexapro shortly after being reunited with her three sons.

Before she could watch Telemundo for days without interruption, but now she spends all her free time breastfeeding, changing diapers, and, on occasion, narrowly avoiding getting bludgeoned to death by a building block.

Lupe Constanza feels similarly despondent and now takes a heavy-dose of Ativan since the return of her nine daughters and two sons has brought on a series of uncontrollable panic attacks. “I thought Trump was like Hitler for keeping us apart,” she said. “But now I think the real crime against humanity is reuniting our family. Some kids belong in cages.”

“The Chancellor was dropped off and was making her way to her train platform when she was greeted by a number of migrant men washing their feet and other body parts from a tap on the main concourse,” Merkel’s attache, Hans Gruper, told Bildt.

The Chancellor was immediately embarrassed by the situation and tried to sneak past the collection of men washing.

At one point, a man pulled down his trousers and proceeded to wash his anus with nothing more than his hand and cold water.

One onlooker found the event quite amusing.

“I saw Merkel holding her breath as she attempted to sneak past the group, but the sight of the man’s anus being washed in front of everyone was too much, even for the Chancellor. Of course, it is not the fault of the migrants, this is how they live in their culture and are not phased by such actions, but in Germany it is not normal or civil behaviour.”

The most recent Hans Soylo film flopped so hard at the box office that it did not even recoup the initial production costs let alone the astronomical marketing bill. Hans Soylo lost the film production company over $700 million dollars.

“Donald’s going to appear in the next Hans Soylo episode as a duck from the planet Quack. He will teach Hans Soylo about the ways of flying the Millennium Falcon.

Today was a historic moment that your children will remember, they will tell their children, and their grandchildren, and their children’s children.

It was the day democracy came back to Europe.

The road to a place where the firmament of justice and democracy lies is not paved with gold, but it is paved with hardship, with thorns and it is perilous, but it is the right path to take, and the British people chose this path over the undemocratic easy EU path where Britain would have become a subservient slave to other masters.

To forge your own path in life, embodies courage, honour and guts. Bravery of immense proportions was displayed at the EU referendum polls last night, as Britain broke free from an entity that eviscerates nations, and in a calculated nature condemns countries to a future of conformity and allegiance to unelected Eurocrats.

Yes, the EU will survive Britain leaving, but it will be an EU made up of sclerotic stuttering countries, most in vast debt, unemployment, unable to solve their economic circumstances because of restrictive EU regulations and economic curbs. Most importantly, the EU through its malevolent obstinate unwillingness to reform has resulted in Britain leaving, a nation that is truly the head of Europe, not only geographically but historically, economically, militarily and culturally.

No doubt, we will still get nil point at the insipid, politically motivated Eurovision song contest, if it is even held next year, although not many care, but our legacy has been about bringing forth a real democratic force back to the European continent so all of that other dross does not matter any more.

Democracy

This is a dawn of a new era, where Britain will regain its voice once again, taking back the reins of its own destiny.

The guileless protestations of the youthful naive Europhiles on the likes of twitter, are merely that. These people did not know how the EU really operated, they did not know of the machinations of the EU behemoth, and were brainwashed, comprehensively tricked by the likes of Cameron and his ministries of disinformation. Such was the inclusive brainwashing of some of these people that they actually believed ‘we are stronger IN’ within some Borg-like EU cube of multiple regulatory undemocratic restrictive gravy train driven soviet enslavement.

Those brainwashed citizens have now been educated in democracy, and let us hope they learn their lesson well, and break free from their mind-altered EU hypnosis. To awaken from their state may be quite a shock, but it is a good shock to the system.

The chief architects of this British EU misery were Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Peter Mandelson, David Cameron and George Osborne. Their evil plan failed. They were scuppered by the Brexit campaign, democracy, and ultimately the people.

Today, you can walk the fields of England with your head held high, and know you are a free man or woman. You can be proud that Britain stood up for what it believed in, for freedom from tyranny, totalitarian rule, undemocratic restrictive laws, and that awful circular starred flag where each star depicts a death of a nation.

Where will this mass censorship drive by left wing tech companies end? The internet is slowly being purged of free thought and freedom of expression by monopoly companies that control 95% of everything now on the world wide web.

All there is is silence. No one apart from a few sites and people are speaking up or doing anything about it.

How ironic that Google once said that it’s motto was: “Don’t be Evil”

Just as Google has censored our satire and parody so too is China.

In retrospect, what is happening right now is beyond evil, because what these monopoly tech companies and their extreme leftist policies are doing is in fact aligning with communist Chinese censorship and its destructive dictatorial ideology. And here we thought we lived in a functioning Western democracy where we had rights of free speech? Alas, the tech companies like twitter, facebook and google have demonstrated otherwise by inhibiting our fundamental rights to human expression and freedom.

How would Decimus Iūnius Iuvenālis have dealt with the Google push against real satire and free speech on the internet?

No doubt, he would have reacted with great disgust. Not only at the punishers of free speech but at the media companies, the authors, the writers, the politicians and supposed guardians of democracy who are NOW silent. Even so-called upholders of investigative journalism and satire, Private Eye, who are now merely establishment BBCified stooges towing the line are silent. You are pathetic in your silence, but one day, you may hark back to this moment and realise you were wrong and cowardly.

Berners Lee? Where is he? Nowhere to be seen.

All we know is, the Daily Squib stood up. We will fight them to the end, to the end of the universe, to the end of time, and to the end of every sinew, every muscle group and every fucking last drop of our spittle for our right to write satire and parody.","First They Came for the Satirists, and I Did Not Speak Out— Because I Was Not a Satirist.",http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/opinion/28007-first-came-satirists-not-speak-not-satirist.html,www.dailysquib.co.uk

The president had gone to nearby Fort McNair to indulge in one of his favorite athletic pursuits, a game of basketball, when he received the fateful injury from his long time rival.

It was a five-on-five contest involving family and friends, including Hillary Clinton, Obama’s Secretary of State.

Speaking from the sidelines, the White House’s internal sports trainer, Reggie Handles, told WKSD News: “She had him over a barrel. She was dribbling; cutting and faking like a bat out of hell. During the second quarter Hillary broke the penetration zone with a match-up zone defence, stuck out her lizard tongue then jab stepped him. Obama came in from the short corner, ball side, and tried to overload the zone. That’s when Hillary smacked Barack like a bitch with her bony elbow. He went down like a sack of potatoes.”

President Obama was later seen from a second floor White House window with an ice pack over his mouth.

In the 2008 presidential election, Hillary Clinton was pipped to the post by Barack Obama, thus losing out on becoming the first ever female president of the United States.",Basketball Player Who Elbowed Obama Identified,http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/2546-basketball-player-who-elbowed-obama-identified.html,www.dailysquib.co.uk
672,672,2011-12-06 09:05:00+01:00,"The scientists, headed by Doctor Julius Sanreso, welcomed the research findings and said that it would be in the interests of those who believe in such nonsense as organised religion or creationism to accept the fact that religious books were written by men as a control system.

“Just think for one second, if ‘God’ or a ‘messenger of God’ had written that particular religious book/bible, how come the writings only occur within a very limited period in human history? Also, consider the fact, that a human writing on a piece of paper, or a few pieces of paper, is not the word of ‘God’. If they were really written by a universal God or entity, the books would not be limited to some pre-medievel costume drama but would encompass all universality, history, the future and science. Language is something created by man, not an all-seeing, all encompassing entity. God would presumably be universal and timeless as well as all-knowing, as is the universe, therefore these man-written books and scriptures, are just that, man-written linguistically created nonsense used to control men and women thousands of years ago. Why would ‘God’ write anything anyway? One must consider the fact that, even now, there are religious zealots and ordinary people still entrenched in a control belief system that is so far removed from reality that it borders on madness. There is no rational or scientific way that organised religions can have a modicum of truth or factual reality because of the very reason that these books are entombed in the time that they were written. These books should therefore simply be viewed as limited parables and historical fiction, as well as a lesson in how millions of people can be so easily controlled.”

The research paper also came to the conclusion that reward/punishment religions, as control systems, were losing their grip on most of the population of the world and only a few die-hard fanatics and delusional maniacs were carrying on with the flame of idiocy.

“The game is up for all religions, how long can this sham carry on, with their ridiculous outdated ceremonies? The priests are deceivers, and they need to come up with some pretty radical solutions to their thousand year old magic trick. People aren’t as dumb or easily swayed as they used to be thousands of years ago, they actually have reasoning powers and can see through the utter nonsense of organised control systems like religion.”

The problem for the world’s political leaders, is that slowly, humans who were controlled for so many years by fictitious writings, may suddenly lose their controlled ‘faith’. This could be quite dangerous, because it would mean that these people would suddenly wake up and realise that they have been fooled for so long by being communally hypnotised.

“We must ensure that the people who have been fooled for so long by fictitious belief systems utilised to control humans do not get too angry when they realise that what they believe in is nonsense written by humans utilising human created language. This could be dangerous for society, so we must either let them carry on believing their fiction or try to somehow support them when they realise the truth,” Dr Sanreso said.",Scientists Prove That All Religious Books Are Man-Made Nonsense,http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/most-popular/3102-scientists-prove-that-all-religious-books-are-man-made-nonsense.html,www.dailysquib.co.uk
673,673,2018-07-03 10:27:35+01:00,"“If you smoke enough of this shit, you definitely will think you are Jesus the Son of God and can perform miracles,” one Bible scholar commented after toking on a large joint.

According to a team of Bible scholars from Colorado University, marijuana and cannabis oil were common place during the era of Jesus in Judea, and much of the population were whacked out on the stuff.

“Like say I smoked three joints off the cuff, then rubbed cannabis oil all over my body and I was on a mountain. It is highly likely I would see a burning bush and hear it talking to me. I mean this shit is so strong you hallucinate with it. If you have schizoid tendencies, you might even hear the voice of God telling you you have to sacrifice your own son to prove your unquestionable allegiance to the God. For fuck’s sake man, if someone did this shit today they would put them away permanently in an asylum…but because in the days of little or no science and goat herders, they put it in a book and called it the word of God.”

Cannabliss

Although the Christian Bible was written by unknown authors 400 years after the supposed events took place, it has been posited that many of the writers were on drugs too.

“From the rhetoric of the Bible which was written during the fall of the Roman Empire and its transition to Christianity, many of the mystics that wrote the stories were on cannabis. It was a staple drug for many writers because it was good for the imagination. Writing while whacked out on ganja opens up avenues never before seen, so these people were going on about fables and mysteries of the era and expanding on them. There are no records of Jesus ever existing, even though the Romans were meticulous record keepers for taxation purposes. One must understand that Jesus is an amalgamation of many deities from the region, and at the time of the fall of the Roman Empire, they really needed something to supersede the authority of the emperors.”

It was not only cannabis that many mystics took at the time, but psychotropic hallucinogenic substances derived from certain cacti, and plants. Harmal, Peganum harmala, was used all across the Middle East, not only as a mystical tool for hallucination but as a remedy for many ailments.

Most world religions are derived from altered states of consciousness, and the root for many religions that still survive today comes from early shamanistic practices from early tribes who travelled the plains. These shamans ingested hallucinogenic plant derivatives and cannabis as an aid to acquiring an altered state of consciousness.

“The process of grinding wild mushrooms, ingesting them then having an out of body hallucinogenic experience is as old as man itself. This dissociative state was seen as finding God. Basically, by taking mind altering drugs, man began to formulate their own religions from not only their surroundings but from their belief systems and expand upon these to create elaborate stories and religions. If you take enough drugs, you will see heaven, you will see hell and you will hear the words of God. Drugs are the channel to another state of awareness, and some say another dimension.”",Bible Experts: Jesus Smoked Marijuana and Used Cannabis Oil For ‘Miracles’,http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/29005-bible-experts-jesus-smoked-marijuana-and-used-cannabis-oil.html,www.dailysquib.co.uk

From there, it is a repeat of a story told many times by the EU. Once the democratically elected elements disintegrate, an EU technocrat is shoehorned into the post as prime minister to keep the EU house in order.

There is definitely no democracy involved in this EU move, as the EU abhors any form of democracy, as can be seen by the Brexit imbroglio, a muddied field of shit that even the most hardened Glastonbury-goers would balk at.

Unfortunately, this scenario is not a scene from some Hollywood film describing the destruction of the democratic process but just happened with the Italian quisling president Sergio Mattarella appointing former IMF goon, Carlo Cottarelli as the desired technocratic outcome to the post of PM despite a fairly elected democratic government wishing otherwise.

All of this is valid proof that democracy does not and cannot exist in the European Union. After all, it is a body ruled completely by unelected officials, who many do not know the names, or what they do.

As Jean claude Juncker, the EU president once said about British calls for a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty: “Of course there will be transfers of sovereignty. But would I be intelligent to draw the attention of public opinion to this fact?,”

How about what Juncker said about the French referendum on the EU constitution: “If it’s a Yes, we will say ‘on we go’, and if it’s a No we will say ‘we continue’,”

This is why anyone who supports the EU is essentially anti-democratic, and does not view their own sovereignty with any value.

As for the poor Italian voters, your vote does not obviously count for shit in your own country, and what the disgraceful EU really means is finally dawning on some of you.

675,675,2018-07-02 10:26:55+01:00,"LOS ANGELES - USA - Many in America are now calling for the Latin word for 'white' to be banned as is the Latin word for 'black'.

The University of Linguistics in Mississippi is calling for the ban of the latin word for white – ‘Album’.

The scholars for the university are outraged that the latin word for ‘black’ is banned, but not white.

“These amount to double standards. Why ban the Latin word for black, but keep the word for white, it is a form of racism that we should not tolerate? We, today live by the standards and root of Latin, and this should be adhered to within our linguistic and societal discourse,” professor Reginald Dwight, told assembled college members at a recent meeting.

Another scholar counteracted the argument by suggesting that the Latin word for black should be un-banned, therefore, the word for white, would be left alone and not banned as well.

However, banning the word for the colour white in Latin, Album, could have implications in the music biz.

Record executive, Donald D. Negreponte, for Warner Bros. was adamant that problems could arise.

“What we gonna call albums then? We been callin’ that shiet albums since the beginning of the mufuggin’ recording industry. Niggaz need to all calm da fuck down, an shiet. I axe all y’all foos to stop runnin’ around like headless chickins and can the hysteria about Latin!”

The discussion is ongoing, and many, especially in socialist states across America where there is a large African American lobby are not calling for the banning of the Latin word for the colour white, simply because it will mean that it is as important as the Latin word for black, which is banned from everyday usage.

“You can’t ban the word white in Latin. Simply because by banning a word, you make it important, and you elevate it to a special status in linguistic usage. We don’t want whites to have the same special status as blacks in America, to use the word to lament over eternally, and to use it as a reason for our victim status. No! Definitely not,” Reverend Kessell Johnsons, said at a recent rally in Chicago.",Calls to Ban Latin Word For ‘White’,http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/28993-calls-to-ban-latin-word-for-white.html,www.dailysquib.co.uk

Speaking at West Point military academy, General D. Franks, a celebrated four star general revealed the pitfalls of sending troops back into Iraq and Syria.

“We’ve just seen another act of savagery committed by the biggest threat the West has seen in a long time. The daily beheadings and other atrocities committed by the Islamic State cannot be solved without a deployment of at least 180,000 troops, full air force support, logistics and trillions of dollars worth of administration as well as intelligence. The second Gulf war cost America an excess of $11 billion per month according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS) and in total the campaigns in both Afghanistan and Iraq cost the U.S. taxpayer over $1 trillion.

“Immediately after the second Gulf wars, the world was plunged into the biggest recession since the end of World War II.

“In relation to the current crisis, we must understand that one cannot win against a state that has infinite recruits without total deployment. The Middle East is a hotbed of Jihadism where by killing one of their number creates one hundred in their place. To this end, there are limited conventional military solutions to the Iraq imbroglio.

“By being dragged into another costly conflict when the world’s economy is still very fragile will increase the velocity of its downfall. We must also add in the Ukraine factor, as this impacts on America’s ability to mobilise large forces on many fronts, spread too thin and too wide we would be sitting ducks.

“The only solution to the threat we are seeing now is either total conscription or nothing. Remember we are dealing with very large numbers of potential enemies who have unlimited time. The U.S. must bring back compulsory conscription if it wants to crush the threats we are seeing effectively.

“The strategy of drone and air force bombings are ineffective as they only target small areas, and are prone to failure due to lack of intelligence on the ground. Further failings by the current administration are seen with the policy of arming other factions to do our work. This is not only a cowardly stance, but highly ineffective and only leads to needless escalation as well as leaving key decisions to other commanders who may or may not have our best interests at hand.

“I therefore propose the re-instatement of the military draft system in the United States as the only way to counteract the multiple threats we are dealing with from many areas of the globe right now. I also propose the budget for the military is increased by over 60% forthwith.”

677,677,2018-06-07 14:22:54+01:00,"Under the careful apathetical watch of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, London’s murder rate is now triple of Bogota or Cartagena.

Tourists who are keen to experience this phenomenon are travelling to London to encounter the murder first hand.

Juan Motola, 43, from Fort Lauderdale, USA, is fascinated by grim tales of the city’s past: “I would read about Jack the Ripper and what he did in the East End when I was a kid. I always imagined the cobbled streets of London amongst the fog and flashes of knives as a poor lady of the night was gutted and left for all to see. I’m coming to the death capital this time to see it all first hand.”

Tourists don’t need to buy expensive tickets to the London Dungeons, or Madame Tussauds, because the real action is on the streets.

Stewart Penrose, a crime consultant reveals the best times to get murdered in the city, as well as the prime spots for a quick dispatch.

“You don’t want to come onto the streets at rush hour in the morning from 7am to 10am. The reason for this is that the Afro Caribbean gangs who commit most of the crime don’t have jobs, and are usually still in bed. If you want a good stabbing, walk the streets after about midday, and of course the night time is the best for getting shanked or chopped by a machete. Don’t forget to flash your Rolex watch or expensive camera wherever you go, this will quicken your demise considerably. South of the river is now the best place to go to get murdered. It’s like the Wild West.”

Because there are no police on the streets of London anymore, thanks to the London Mayor’s orders, violent crime has risen as much as by 80% in some areas.

Tourist Abel Dannon, from France arrived in London on a Tuesday, and had been murdered by Wednesday his brother revealed.

“He was sad about breaking up with his girl. He bought a one way ticket to London, and we wondered why. According to reports, he was seen walking down Croydon High Street holding up job application leaflets. The last I heard was it was a quick death for him. About twenty thugs descended upon him with machetes. People just stepped over his mangled body for hours.”

Indeed, murder now is so common place that many bodies scattered on the streets are routinely ignored.

“It’s just another day in a Labour run city. I had to step over four bodies and a severed hand this morning on the way to work.

The Remainer PM, Theresa May, who could not negotiate her way out of a paper bag, is a lacklustre wet drip with no fucking balls or desire to free Britain from the octopus grip of the EU with a real Brexit as voted by the people.

Mrs. May has again capitulated for the umpteenth time to demands from not only the EU but now Ireland, an EU controlled country now led by an Indian homosexual PM, who prefers picking pansies in his boutique garden to making any sort of common sense negotiations.

Thanks to the Remainer insipid PM, Britain is now tied to the EU for god knows how long with the so-called Customs-Union and Single Market. This means that International trade deals are now postponed indefinitely, and the whole premise of Brexit is non-existent.

You can hear the traitorous Remainers on big bank busting EU pension plans and Brussels handouts laughing joyously as Britain is sold down the river once again, the people trodden on, democracy now a long distant memory.

For these people, these traitors, these vile scum sucking Remainers who willingly wipe their arses on the British flag for money and hatred of their own nation, this is a definite win for them.

What this means is that the ‘will of the people’ means nothing in Britain today. Democracy does not exist in Britain. All those promises before the EU Referendum that the vote would be final, would be legally binding and a true measure of the democratic will of the people — it was all a big fucking lie.

The people have been lied to, dragged through the dirt, their vote usurped, spit on and defiled. The sovereign right for Britain to rule itself, make its own rules, make its own trade deals on its own terms, control its own borders, are all a dream of the past. For thousands of years these islands have always made their own destiny, but today that is all gone, we as an island are now ruled comprehensively by others from foreign lands who are milking us monetarily and do not care one fig about us.

Britain is effectively a beaten country, ruled by traitors, sold off for the lowest price to foreign powers for a pittance.

Remainers spit on the graves of those who died in the two great wars to bring Britain freedom. They scowl at the graves, pull down their trousers and literally shit on the graves of those soldiers who gave their lives for Britain. Remainers are the evil face of pure hatred and greed, their avarice fuelled by unelected members of the EU Commission and their handouts in brown envelopes delivered to these quisling Remainers in dark back alleys.

Lord Haw Haw would be proud today at Remainers and the House of Lords, who betrayed Britain, sold us off to the enemy with no fucking way of getting out.

And all of this happened under the gaze of so-called Brexiteers in Cabinet and parliament. Brexiteers, who were meant to defend democracy, and the will of the people yet did nothing…they were impotent. They postulated of course, we will do this, we will do that, but they had no fucking balls to do anything, too afraid of losing their positions in government or parliament. Not one of them stood up for Britain, there was no sacrificial Charge of the Light Brigade cry as they ran towards the enemy, they just stood by and watched, powerless, creatures with not one single fucking bollock between them, a vomitous menage of losers, braced with yellow piss coloured cowardice.

One must therefore assume the so-called Brexiteers in parliament are in cahoots with the Remainers, that is the only conclusion to come to, and it is a sad detrimental conclusion that ultimately reveals the truth about this whole Brexit farce.

Fuck You

No one should dictate to Britain what it can and cannot do. Britain dictates to others, not the other way round.

Ireland and its demands are thus rendered impotent, because Ireland is a land ruled by the EU, they are a beaten country, a land which has already been conclusively beaten and defeated by Brussels. Fuck you. You are now worthless, you are not Ireland anymore, you are something else, you are lower than dirt, a defeated people with no self worth or national pride.

Build a 200 ft high steel wall across the infected border with Northern Ireland, man it with turrets and electric fences to make a successful Brexit. If it means this, let it be, to free Britain from the EU, without loss of territory — let it be.

People who have these VR sets are already completely addicted to the sensation of total immersion within another world, and this is the clincher, soon they will not be able to live without their VR headsets.

The natural progression from an external device, like a pair of goggles is to have a chip implanted into the brain directly which will link up with the synapses and billions of dendrites. These chips are already in use for the severely disabled, however their development is accelerating daily.

Mapping out every channel and synapse in the human brain is a feat in itself, and they have already mapped out the brains of rodents and smaller creatures.

“We can upload any scenario directly into your brain, you will feel as if you are there, you will see, smell, and feel every nuance the programmers introduce into the world, you will taste food, you will feel the wind on your cheek, every sensation you feel in the real world can be replicated in the brain directly through the zones activated by the neural implants.

“This technology will be sold through the premise of perfect memory and data recall. Imagine going to a dinner party and knowing who the head honchos are to schmooze with immediate data downloaded into your brain, imagine being able to speak in any language at the drop of a hat, or recall any text ever written by man at the blink of an eye,” a scientist on the project revealed.

The next step will no doubt be a jump from the intrusive machinery strapped on to our bodies to the discreet internal implants, and of course with every leap forwards there is always a leap backwards in freedom. You will essentially allow an external force into your own mind.

Behaviour modification

“We have apps now for everything, and in the future, you want to fly that Huey, just download the app in thirty seconds and you will be an expert pilot. Yes, it sounds very Matrix, but consider the fact that every six months, the power of computers doubles. We are getting very close now to a point of no return, and the processing power in chips is getting more powerful, yet shrinking in size. We will be able to alter every facet of someone’s behaviour. After the chipping process, you will not be recognisable.

“This is not one way traffic, and advertisers will be able to beam adverts directly into your brain. If you do not comply with whichever regime or government is in charge, they can not only shut you down, but implant nightmares into your own brain to torture you for your crimes. We can see prisoners in jail, who will be put into states of mind torture lasting thousands of years, this is accomplished by speeding their mind clock to the desired level. Prisoners could therefore spend thousands of years breaking rocks with no end in sight, all in their own minds,” the scientist added.

Once they’re in your head, that’s it.

The future will certainly be an interesting place but with the introduction of artificial intelligent systems, sentient machinery and brainchipping, there may be no place for humans to go other than the augmented fashion.

What these people do not understand is that humans today, especially the royal family, are essentially the same as people who lived thousands of years ago, with the same foibles and discriminatory outlook. Nothing will ever change humanity, and its general makeup. Nothing.

There will be no more rugby games, or footie, just indoctrination into the pseudo-Marxist SJW race-baiting agenda by his new mullato wife, who is a member of BLM and undoubtably has a very large chip on her shoulder, ready to trigger the race card at any moment.

Colonial artefacts purged from Queen’s palaces

The new member of the royal family, Meghan Markle also wants anything that shows Britain’s colonial past to be scrapped, including the Crown Jewels which have diamonds seized from former colony, India.

“I have been to Balmoral, and the Tower of London where the Queen keeps her Crown jewels. These are remnants of an Imperial colonial time in which Britain stole from countries and gave nothing back. I will make it my mission to change the royal family forever, and will demand they repatriate all of these stolen items to their former homes,” Markle shouted decisively at a courtier today.

The IQ challenged Prince realised the mistake he has made only today, after he was brutally scolded for watching highlights of the FA Cup final on telly. His American bride does not condone any form of laddish behaviour and to see the prince sitting on the sofa with a beer in his hand watching the match re-run infuriated her SJW Marxist feminist sensibilities. Any form of sport, is deemed as masculine and against emasculating feminine sensibilities.

“Everywhere I go in these palaces, all I see are antiquities and jewellery stolen from colonial lands. I am disgusted by it all. Also, there will be no hunting. I understand the royals like to hunt animals. I will put my foot down and disallow them from carrying on with it, and if they don’t stop I will be on the phone to PETA (an American organisation against animal cruelty),” Markle added.

There will thus be no more hijinks and laddery from poor old Prince Harry, who has now been consigned to the mortuary slab of politically correct SJW death after marrying the American whose sole agenda is to castrate the royal family, and change them into something they definitely are not.

684,684,2018-05-17 11:08:18+01:00,"KINSHASA - Congo - One would have thought that things may have changed since the last outbreak of Ebola, but sadly they have not.

Health Minister Oly Ilunga late Wednesday said two suspected cases of hemorrhagic fever were reported in the Wangata health zones, which includes Mbandaka city, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) from Bikoro, the rural area where the outbreak began.

He said one sample proved positive for the deadly Ebola virus.

Ilunga said Congo now is entering an urban phase of the outbreak, with higher spread potential. He said epidemiologists are working to identify additional contacts to the 500 already identified.

Lessons not learned

One would have thought the people and authorities in Congo would have learned that the eating of bushmeat is a cause of the spread of Ebola, but many have not heeded any warnings.

Bushmeat is still a staple diet of many Africans, even though there is solid scientific evidence proving that deadly pathogens are spread into the human population from ingesting bushmeat.

In the Congo, bushmeat consists of monkeys, crocodiles, antelope, snakes, gorillas and bats. Bats carry highly infectious pathogens and are one of the primary causes of the spread of Ebola.

With international travel, and a steady flow of traffic from the Congo to Europe and other destinations, it is only a matter of time until the spread of any infectious tropical virus like Ebola spreads.

The symptoms are not seen for some time once infected, 21 days is the usual incubation period. This is why it is easy to take a flight to Paris, France from the Congo with no problems. During the flight, the infected passenger may infect many more passengers simply through a sneeze or cough. Water droplets carry the virus with little effort, and the victim ingests the droplets either through the nasal passage, mouth or even pores in the skin.

Thanks to the EU Schengen zone, the spread of Ebola throughout the European peninsula would be quite quick unless contained early.

Already, many illegal migrants from Congo, Eritrea, and other parts of Africa make their way towards the crossing from Libya onto Italy.

It is safe to say that Italy would become ground zero during a major Ebola outbreak as the number of migrants making the treacherous crossing in boats is rising daily.

The Ebola virus is transmitted by bodily fluids, and even after being cured, the virus exists in semen for three months, therefore it can be transmitted far and wide.

Death from Ebola is usually extremely painful as the internal organs are eaten away and massive internal bleeding occurs shutting down the whole system.",Africans Love Their Bushmeat,http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/28612-ebola-spreads-africans-love-bushmeat.html,www.dailysquib.co.uk

Lawless London Update

In a recent tabloid interview, Mr Javid said he was standing outside Euston station when the moped thugs rode on to the pavement.

They deposited a large Zombie knife deep into his head and zoomed off, he said, which left him “angry and upset”.

He said he is now working on a review to give police more power to pursue moped murderers and thugs.

“Before I knew what was happening, this large Zombie knife was embedded firmly in my brain,” said Mr Javid, who was appointed home secretary in April, becoming responsible for the UK’s policing and security.

Speaking of the incident, which happened last Tuesday, he said: “I was angry and upset but thought myself lucky they did not steal my precious iPhone or Rolex watch as have many who fall prey to these vicious criminals.”

His revelation comes days after unfunny ‘comedian’ Michael McIntyre was robbed by men on a moped in north-west London.

Home Office proposals announced this month aim to ban the sale of the weapon of choice of these moped thugs — Zombie knives.

The new Home Office rules will also give police powers to pursue criminals if they have committed a crime.

“If someone commits a crime and police want to pursue them, they should be allowed to.”

Meanwhile in London, it is all too easy to acquire hand guns, sold for as little as £50 a piece in most pubs, and even though Zombie knives are now banned as well these can easily be found in any open market for £10.",Home Secretary Sajid Javid Bans Zombie Knives,http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/28892-home-secretary-sajid-javid-bans-zombie-knives.html,www.dailysquib.co.uk

“If you are a British expat, get your money out yesterday, if you are Spanish, get your money out sooner than yesterday, if you have a property in Spain, try and sell it, although I’m afraid you may be mierda out of luck with that idea, how can you sell something that is pretty much worthless now and will be even more worthless soon when the debt maelstrom hits?” an insider from the Spanish Finance Ministry told a Spanish business journal.

What happened in Cyprus is destined to happen in Spain soon therefore it seems the wheel of misfortune turns its weary cycle over the troublesome euro waters daily, churning away leaving frothing sewage water in its cumbersome wake.





As the Eurogroup President, Jeroen Dijsselbloem said, that “if necessary the uninsured deposit holders” will be gored by the bull’s horns and thus there is the rub, there is no chivalry left in Espana as Don Quixote has been kicked firmly in the cojones by his trusty squire’s donkey; Picasso would surely have crafted a diabolical sculpture of a deformed woman to represent the broken euro and Salvador Dali would have simply shat in a purple bucket standing on top of a lobster, as for Gaudi, his representation of the euro would be a pile of ceramic rubble.

“Spain is the big one for the euro. When Spain’s banks need to be recapitalised again, you can simply kiss your bank deposit goodbye. Especially with Spain’s unemployment currently at 26.7% things are definitely not getting better for people.

The state of the NHS, not only from health tourism coming into Britain on a constant basis, but from abuse of use by EU migrants, and drunken louts, is a disgrace to behold.

Call for an ambulance, and it may never come, that’s because resources are stretched way too thin considering the massive increase in population on this tiny isle called Britain. Dying on a trolley after a 35 hour wait is now just a common every day occurrence.

You may be in dire straits, your kid is sick and unconscious, the ambulance never arrives, in desperation you drive to the nearest hospital but are greeted by hundreds of people. By the time it comes around to your ticket, five hours later, your child does not have a pulse. The overworked doctors and nurses simply shrug their shoulders, there is nothing anyone could do. It’s another day in the dying NHS, an overcrowded death factory, where millions of desperate sick humans fawn for a simple five minute session with a weary eyed sleepless doctor.

Why not visit the wards, where no one speaks English, or the maternity wards where Nigerian women fly in daily to Heathrow to have their quintuplets all paid for by the British taxpayer, expensively delivered, lock stock and barrel. After they drop their sprogs, they’re on the next flight out, never to be seen or heard of again, unless they have some life threatening emergency that is. Naturally, there are no checks on the deluge into Britain’s hospitals, and anyone can get treatment costing thousands without a word being uttered.

The sheer amount of wasted taxpayers money to health tourism per annum is astonishing, we’re talking £6 billion in eight years, not like a few quid here or there. Add on the massive influx from poor Eastern European countries, and the cost sky rockets although no one is saying a word about it.

The NHS when it was first introduced was only built for Britain, not for the whole earth’s population. This is why it will not survive in its current form for another three years tops, maybe four if the current borderless situation carries on.

Today, the EU president, Jean Claude Juncker said that Britain will have to agree to everything if it remains in the EU and it will never be able to reform the European Union, directly contradicting the ailing PM, David Cameron.

“We have concluded a deal with the prime minister, he got the maximum he could receive, we gave the maximum we could give.”

“So there will be no renegotiation, not on the agreement we found in February, nor as far as any kind of treaty negotiations are concerned.”

This is why to preserve our democracy, it is imperative that we Vote Leave on June 23. This is the only way the UK can ensure our sovereignty.

The UK has been outvoted every time it has voted against an EU measure – 72 times in total. 40 of these defeats have taken place since David Cameron became Prime Minister. This costs the UK taxpayer £2.4 billion a year. We do not get our way on the issues we care about.

Since the UK joined the EU in 1973, it has lost 101 out of 131 cases before the European Court, a failure rate of 77.1%. Since David Cameron became Prime Minister in May 2010, the UK has been defeated on 16 occasions: a failure rate of 80%.

EU rules mean that we don’t have the power to intervene to get our way at home. The Government has acknowledged that its scope to intervene in the steel crisis is limited by EU state aid rules. The Business Minister, Anna Soubry MP, has said ‘We have to be very careful because we have to be compliant with state aid rules.

This latest intervention by the EU president represents a major blow to the Tory leader’s hopes of persuading still undecided voters to vote Remain with the promise of a further renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with Brussels.

It comes as no surprise then that men are just leaving women alone, because in the end men cannot win if they help a woman or leave them alone.

No doubt, this is what happened in a recent incident in the London Underground when a woman was attacked verbally and physically by a mentally unstable nutter. The two men in the carriage casually walked off into the adjoining carriage leaving the woman alone with her attacker.

There is little cause for modern feminist women to be alarmed by this, because it is a hole dug solely by themselves as they have alienated men to such a level that men are going their own way, and leaving women alone to get on with it.

The chivalrous male still lives on only in the imagination, because to open a door for a woman is seen as a serious sexist chauvinist act, and to protect a woman in this day and age can lead to men being prosecuted for sexist outrage, let alone daring to compliment a woman on her looks.

One cannot even ask a woman out on a date, or her phone number without being dragged through the courts, or feminist friendly newspapers. The media is now chock block full of articles where innocent men are charged with rape when in the past it would be labelled as bad fumbling uncommunicative sex.

The #metoo generation is one of thug rule, of judgement and sentence before fair trial, of alienating men to such a level that repair of the damage meted on relations with the opposite sex are nigh on impossible.

Also, even though the elite will have their safe havens and specialist shelters, they must be just as careful during the war as the ordinary civilians, because their shelters can still be compromised.”

691,691,2018-06-02 12:33:04+01:00,"Excited about the World Cup? You should be.

It’s a four week fiesta of football where most of – not all, there are several big name players who won’t be involved in the tournament, because of injury or due to their nation’s failure to qualify – the world’s best will be strutting their stuff.

The best part? Discovering ‘new’ stars or players who take the tournament by storm.

There are always a few in every World Cup – those players who we already know about but who step up with a string of exciting performances.

So, with all due respect to established greats such as Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, here are six players worth keeping an eye on this summer.

Timo Werner – Germany

Look out for Werner in this World Cup. He’s got a crucial role to play for defending champions Germany, who are, not surprisingly, among the bookies’ favourites to win again. If they do triumph on July 15, they’ll surely need Werner’s goals. With Miroslav Klose long retired and Mario Gomez now 32, Werner is Germany’s new big goalscoring hope. He’s still quite the novice in terms of international football but the 22-year-old Leipzig striker scored seven goals in his first 13 caps – a fast and impressive start.

Antoine Griezmann – France

Not exactly a bright young prospect – Griezmann turned 27 this year so he’s in his prime – but this is a big tournament for the Frenchman. Actually, it’s going to be a big couple of months. For starters, his club future has been the subject of wild speculation, with a move from Atletico Madrid to Barcelona strongly tipped. It could be a career-defining transfer for Griezmann. In the tournament, there will be a massive focus on him. In the 2014 World Cup, he featured in five matches but failed to score. This time, according to the odds, he should be contention to be 2018’s top scorer. Can he deliver on his promise?

Hirving Lozano – Mexico

This lad could be something very special indeed. He might not be widely known outside of Mexico or the Netherlands – where he plays his club football, for PSV Eindhoven – but that’s going to change over the next few weeks. Lozano is a goalscoring winger who can play on the right or left, and his single season with PSV was a huge success. He scored 17 goals in 29 games for the Eredivisie club, and his return of seven in his first 27 caps for Mexico is pretty decent. PSV won’t want to sell him but if they do, they can expect a healthy mark-up on the £7m they paid for him in 2017.

Paulo Dybala – Argentina

There are other players in Argentina’s squad besides Messi and despite the never-ending coverage surrounding the Barcelona superstar, the South Americans have a lot of other talented footballers in their ranks. Indeed, if Argentina are going to win a first World Cup since 1986, Messi won’t be able to do it all on his own. Dybala is one of the strong supporting cast. He’s in that group of good players who aren’t quite in the top bracket – yet.

A versatile striker – he can play as a centre-forward or just behind – his international career hasn’t really got going; he hadn’t scored for Argentina in 12 appearances when the squad was finalised. Time to break his duck?

Aleksandar Mitrovic – Serbia

Something of a leftfield choice, perhaps, but Mitrovic will be a pivotal figure in Serbia’s campaign. Not only that, he’s box office viewing. When he plays, don’t take your eyes off him. He’s just as likely to pull a goal from nowhere as he is to do something reckless; at his worst he can be hot-headed. But at this best, he’s a powerful, influential centre-forward. And his goalscoring record at this level has to be respected, with 13 goals in his first 36 caps. It’s easy to forget that he’s still only 23, with his best years ahead of him.

Gabriel Jesus – Brazil

Want to feel old? Jesus was only 17 at the time of the last World Cup – fast forward four years and he’s part of a dazzling Brazil forward line. He might be the junior member of the squad but don’t expect the Manchester City striker to be there simply to make up the numbers; he captained the team in a recent friendly. His scoring record for Brazil is impressive too – his first 16 caps yielded nine goals. He may yet upstage senior colleagues Neymar and Roberto Firmino.",Six Players to Watch at the World Cup,http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/sports/28830-scouting-report-six-players-watch-world-cup.html,www.dailysquib.co.uk
692,692,2018-05-16 09:26:32+01:00,"When we think about the world of online gambling, we can think that this is a bit of a shady industry. However, the UK Gambling Commission, UKGC for short, are tackling bad practice in the industry in order to make it a safer practice for players. Recently, we’ve seen some massive fines coming into play from this governing body.

LeoVegas and Self-Exclusion

Over the last few months, there have been a lot of fines handed down for a variety of different reasons. LeoVegas, one of the larger operators out there, have been fined because of their practices around self-exclusion. So what exactly does this mean?

Self-exclusion is a very valuable tool for players that have identified that they may have a gambling addiction. This allows them to put stops in place, effectively suspending their account for a set period of time. This can be temporary, for a month, or permanent – depending on what the player feels is appropriate.

During this time, the operator has some serious obligations to the player. They have to treat this player differently, as they have flagged that they have an issue with gambling. Problem gambling is a serious issue and one that operators have to respect and stamp out where possible. This means that they can’t communicate with the player to offer them promotions or attempt to have them coming back before their exclusionary period is up.

The failings of LeoVegas include marketing to these excluded players, allowing them to gamble and not taking reasonable steps to support them. They were also found to be running ads that were deemed to be misleading. These were misleading due to extensive terms that were not represented or claims that were embellished.

The result of this ruling was a £627,000 fine for the entertainment site, which was deemed to be the rough amount of profit accrued due to these business practices.

888’s £7.8million Fine

One of the largest fines that we’ve ever seen handed down by the UKGC is the £7.8million bill delivered to 888. This was on similar grounds to the previous one levied against LeoVegas, for failings relating to self-exclusion. As a much larger operator, it makes sense that they have a much bigger fine to pay.

More than 7000 of their excluded players were impacted by these failings. These players were still able to access their account and place bets, even after submitting their desire to exclude. This is a serious flaw within the self-exclusion system and for such a large operator it’s not an acceptable flaw to have.

From there, it was also found that one of their players was able to place bets amounting to £1.3million without any form of checks. Operators are responsible for checking in on players spending habits, to ensure that they are playing with their own money and in a responsible fashion. This player had actually stolen this money from their employer and potential action from 888 could have mitigated this.

The money that has been fined by the UKGC was found to be the profits from these players and will be used to fund problem gambling charities. 888 are now working with the government body to produce a sturdier self-exclusion system going forward.

Systematic Failures from William Hill

Another big name operator, William Hill, has also been fined over the course of the last year. They have been fined a total of £6.2million because of what the UKGC are calling ‘systematic failures’. Money laundering is a serious concern for operators, as they have a responsibility to know their players to prevent this from happening.

Online gambling can be a funnel for those looking to launder money from illegal activities. As the money paid in and out of online gambling sites can be volatile, it’s an easy way to move cash around from illegal activities. The onus is on the operator to be able to assess where the money is coming from and identifying players to investigate further.

Ten of their customers were able to deposit over £1.2million, which was later found to be linked to criminal activity. This was deemed to be unacceptable by the UKGC, as they effectively allowed these illegal funds to be legitimised through their platform. In their eyes, William Hill should have taken steps to query where these funds were coming from on such high stakes wagers.

Next Steps for the UK Gambling Industry

This seems to be indicative of an overall trend within the industry, as more operators are taken to task over these issues. Socially responsible operators like Lucky Admiral are paving the way by taking steps to ensure that they are compliant. For many operators, it makes sense to attempt to create this kind of safety net by taking their own steps to be better, rather than waiting for a fine to be handed down.

In the wake of GDPR, these sites will also have to think about how they handle player data too. This is a massive undertaking for any gambling site, as they potentially have millions of player profiles. It can also be somewhat contradictory with the rights of self-excluded players. Although they can ask for their data to be removed, operators would still have to retain enough information to prevent them from gambling with them again.

We’ve also seen a lot of emphasis placed on underage gambling. These underage players can also be failed by the system, as they should be assessed prior to being able to gamble. This includes ID checks and flagging up fraudulent information. We’re also seeing a sizeable reduction in the number of sites using cartoon mascots, as these have also been deemed by the CAP as attractive to underage gamblers. We may see more fines on the way for sites that aren’t placing enough checks for these players.

The UK gambling market is becoming tougher for operators, as the UKGC proposes more rules and regulations. It seems that conscious operators will be able to change their processes to stay compliant, those that don’t will be at risk of a fine.",UKGC is Fighting Gambling Operators with Big Fines,http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/business/28761-ukgc-fighting-gambling-operators-big-fines.html,www.dailysquib.co.uk

The unscripted Obama docu-series for Netflix will air in September on the stock market listed company’s streaming service.

The Obamas, who have kept a relatively low profile since leaving office, have established a company named Lower Ground Productions to manage the project.

The New York Times has previously reported the former president was in talks to develop shows “that highlight inspirational gay and transexual stories” rather than delve into cheap political smears of conservative views and attitudes.

The first episode of the series will focus on the bath houses of San Francisco and how they were instrumental in the emancipation of promiscuous gay men who spread AIDS across the country during the eighties.

“I attended the bath houses a lot during filming, and it was truly inspirational to see the boys doing their thang. I was the towel boy, they would tell me which cubicle to go clean up, you know with a mop and a dirt rag. I talk in depth about the decor of these places, and the clients who frequent,” Obama revealed.

During filming, Obama sustained an injury to his lower back after slipping on a load of semen left on the floor by a dozen men enjoying the bath house.

“One minute I was holding the mop, then whoops, I fell flat on my back. Luckily I was brought back to my feet by some hunky guys who then taught me a lesson or three for being so gymnastic in their presence.”

“I have a dream..”

The episode will suggest that every American city and town must have bath houses installed, not only to comply with modern inclusion rules, but to provide a firm ground for the spread of HIV throughout the country.

“I have a dream. Every city corner, every town centre, to have at least two or three gay bath houses,” Obama says defiantly at the end of the episode.

The attention of the U.S. Treasury was drawn by the French President Nicolas Sarkozy who requested an immediate investigation. He described the Standard & Poor’s actions as “inhuman” in a statement on Thursday.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner agreed with Sarkozy that the video was “deplorable” and he promised that the Treasury will carry out an investigation.

The actions in the video were furthermore depicted as illegal by the top Treasury chairman, Ben Bernanke.

“This urination video takes us and the euro back to the stone age. I thought they [the Americans] were civilized but I was wrong. Showing a bunch of S&P downgraders pissing on some euro notes is despicable. I have a good mind to merde on a few dollars.

Much like a puppy has to be broken in, the summit leaders, Angela Merkel and French President Macron, along with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau told the American president off for his big smelly turds, which attracted large bluebottle flies into the luncheon room.

German Chancellor, Angela Merkel scolded the Donald for ‘doing a very very bad thing, mein gott!’ and even threatened to rub his nose in it as a lesson.

Watched by other G7 summit attendees, even the Japanese PM balked at the disgusting display, upturning his nose when the smell hit his nostrils.

The incident occurred during luncheon, when all the delegates were sitting at their tables, and the food was served.

“We had just been served the first course of celeriac risotto, toasted buckwheat, truffle, Chanterelle mushrooms, rosemary and celery leaf when Mr. Trump stood up, undid his trousers and pulled down his Y-fronts. He then positioned his large buttocks over the plate and these large turds came out of his asshole as he grunted with gusto. He seemed to find it pleasurable as his eyes rolled up showing only the whites as large pieces of excrement flopped unceremoniously onto the table and plate. The smell hit us immediately and some delegates vomited. Mr. Trump giggled like a little boy as he wiped his messy ass with the expensive cloth napkins, even grabbing Theresa May’s napkin when finished with his one,” a shocked Canadian PM Trudeau recalled.

After the display, the delegates crowded around Mr. Trump to tell him off and tried to educate him in the ways of G7 summit etiquette.

Political commentator and psychologist, Bernard Ernst, examined Trump’s behaviour and tried to rationalise it afterwards.

“Mr Trump is a primal animal. This is the way he showed his displeasure, by taking a big shit on the table. It is obvious that he does not approve of events at the G7 summit, and what he also did was to designate the area as his territory, much like a dog does with urine and excrement.”

“It’s like this, we’ve got some majorly rich G7 countries who are going to mingle with some slightly rich G20 countries and they in turn are going to mingle with the G54 lot. It’s going to be the party of the century and we’re making sure we have the right type and amount of canapés at the meeting,” Ashley Risburger, a representative of the G20 nations told the Financial Times.

With power shifting from the G7 and onto the G4, the G20 nations have sometimes felt underappreciated with the proceedings and are now pushing for the G54 contingent to muscle in as well.

“This is the first time all the G7, G20, G4 and G54 countries are meeting in one hall. We’re so excited but it’s going to be one heck of a meeting,” Sam Finklestein, a US eco lobbyist told Reuters.

There are plans to amalgamate all the G nations into one group of G240 countries but some diplomats say that this would mean that the meetings would be less frequent annually thus depriving delegates of gourmet meals and other goodies.

Larry Jenkem, who deals with International Monetary Policy, was today calling for a change of letter within the G nations.

“We want a different letter. Maybe we should move onto F countries. You know like F20 and F7. I think that actually sounds better than G,” Mr Jenkem exclaimed.

Some commentators on the G20, G7, G4 and G54 have however chosen to ignore all the suggestions because of the yawn inducing nature of the whole matter.

Tony Humbug, 49, an agitated British voter said: “F*cking hell, it’s enough to make you want to shave your eyeballs with a rusty razor. These G whatever meetings they’re always having. They just talk and talk and talk. Pamper themselves on booze, gourmet food and high class pr*stitutes then go back home to repeat the same thing next year. All the while, outside every meeting there are people causing bloody havoc with riots while these ponced up arseholes are blabbing away as if nothing’s going on. I’m sick of the whole bloody lot.

698,698,2018-06-04 11:26:34+01:00,"LONDON - England - As the daily stabbings and shootings continue in the Labour controlled capital city, nothing is being done by the Mayor.

Labour’s London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, has justified the current crime spree amongst predominantly black people as a ‘natural form of population control’ and has even gone on to proclaim it as a form of ‘eugenics’.

It was in fact the socialist creed of William Beveridge, the architect of the post-1945 welfare state, and highly active member in the eugenics movement who said that “those men who through general defects are unable to fill such a whole place in industry are to be recognised as unemployable. They must become the acknowledged dependents of the State… but with complete and permanent loss of all citizen rights – including not only the franchise but civil freedom and fatherhood”.

The plan in those days was simple, as proposed by other socialist thinkers like Bertrand Russell. The gene pool for the elite must not be tainted by inferior bloodlines, and all ‘useless eaters’ should be sterilised or aborted before birth. Today, they’re just killing themselves off with mass stabbings and shootings.

Nothing to Lose

As the disenfranchised ethnic youth today in London continue on their stabbing sprees, the problem today is one predominantly of the Afro-Caribbean youth.

“These people are completely disenfranchised from societal norms. They are ill educated, with no desire for education or legitimate jobs. They are essentially wild feral beasts on the rampage, and can only express themselves with extreme violence, thuggery and thievery. These are Labour’s children. We cherished and nurtured their non-education through our welfare system by rewarding failure. We invited their parents in to this country knowing full well their children would create complete chaos, fear and discord, as this was good for our socialist longterm agenda to always have ‘useless eaters’ vying for our supposed help and vote for us. By throwing millions and billions of taxpayers money at these feckless feral runts we thus undermined the capitalist system which we abhor so much,” the Labour Mayor’s office said in a statement earlier today.

Many parts of South London, and urban council estates are now war zones thanks to the Labour policies of the past where it was mandatory to build estates bang in the middle of affluent areas. This form of social engineering has created clear delineation, where on one side the affluent live in perpetual fear, and on the other the chaotic hopeless create crime.

“In London, you can live in a £3 million property, but walk a few yards across the road and you will find a council estate where drug gangs rule, where people are stabbed daily, and where the disenfranchised only have to look out of their windows to see how the other half live. It is possibly a cruel form of torture for these people who know that the only way they will receive any large reward is by drug running or by murder. This is what Labour created. At least in cities like Paris, the poor are bundled in high rises only on the outskirts of the city, and out of sight, although with the Schengen zone, things have recently changed and the tent cities from the African continent have erupted in the centre of Paris, that is another conversation for another day,” one commentator on the situation told the Evening Standard.

Meanwhile, the London Mayor does nothing. The Metropolitan Police have been neutered by Mr. Khan’s laissez faire attitude, and are not allowed to ‘stop and search’ anymore by the Labour mayor.

The killings continue daily..

The luncheon held in Cannes on June 21 announced the latest set-up for the Epica Awards in 2018.

Epica will hold its next jury meeting, conference and ceremony in Amsterdam from November 12 to 15. The ceremony itself will be held at the city’s KIT Royal Tropical Institute.

This year’s jury president will be Tony Chambers, Brand and Content Director of Wallpaper* magazine.

He commented: “As someone who’s passionate about design, branding and communications, I’m delighted to be able to join fellow journalists in these fields to determine who’s doing the most innovative creative work right now.”

The competition’s visually striking new advertising campaign has been created by Wieden & Kennedy in Amsterdam. It reflects Epica’s impartial approach and unique positioning.

In addition, Epica announced the creation of two new grand prix. The Responsibility Grand Prix will honour the best public interest work. It is supported by ACT Responsible, an organisation that supports cause-related advertising.

The Alternative Media Grand Prix will be awarded to the most original campaign in non-traditional channels such as ambient, experiential, events and stunts.

Two new categories to take note of this year: Topical & Real Time Advertising, covering operations that react to current events; and of course the return of World Cup Advertising.

Epica’s editorial director Mark Tungate said: “As usual we’re always trying to evolve with the industry, and we felt that both these grand prix were lacking: one specifically recognizing creativity for good causes; and the other celebrating originality in the range of channels beyond traditional advertising.” He added: “It will be a pleasure to present these and the other awards in Amsterdam, one of our favourite locations over the years due to its creative vitality.”

700,700,2018-06-05 10:53:33+01:00,"Every four years during the summer, the number of ‘unauthorised absences’ at UK businesses suffers a sharp upturn. This head-scratching anomaly is made even more curious by the fact that the four-year cycle matches the four-year circle of the FIFA World Cup, precisely.

Of course, in reality this convergence of sickies and football is not too hard to understand, and a recent survey held by the football tipping site FootballTips.com had revealed that workers in the UK are not exactly abashed to admit that they ‘play hookey’ during the four weeks of the world’s greatest sporting tournament.

Naturally, one of the main joys of sneaking off work during the World Cup Finals is getting away with it scot-free – but if you’re tempted to miss work to watch Panama take on Tunisia during this year’s finals, then don’t rest on your laurels that you’re going to get away with it. Out of the 2,203 people aged eighteen and over questioned by FootballTips, 41% of them said they’d been hauled in front of their bosses for a dressing down over their absenteeism.

The first question asked in the survey was “How many days will you take off work to watch the World Cup this year?”. The average answer was a whopping seven days, but when asked how many of these absences would be unauthorised, that figure dropped to four. Hopefully you’re asking yourself where are these companies that allow employees to take three ‘authorised’ absences just to watch football.

Survey respondents were also asked if they had taken time of work to watch the 2014 World Cup, and 68% of them said that they had, and, as mentioned above, 41% of those who took time off for the football found themselves in trouble for doing so.

If you need to find some quick bogus excuses for time off during this year’s finals, note that ‘a doctor’s appointment’ was the most popular reason given by employees for a World Cup sickie at 32%, with a straightforward ‘I’m too ill to work’ next at 20%. Winning the third-place play-off is ‘a family emergency’ at 17%.

Calculating the cost the World Cup makes to the UK economy is no easy task, but if we take that 44.5 million people watched the 2014 World Cup in the UK, and that 43% of them were in full-time employment, that gives a workforce of 19 million people. If each took seven days of seven hours off at a rate of around £14 per hour, that gives us (19 million x 7 x 7 x 14) £13 billion in lost revenue.

A spokesman for FootballTips, Tom Rooney, said “The World Cup is of course a hugely important time for many of us living in the UK, even though England usually do terribly. It is surprising how many people plan to take time off to watch the games, especially as over half of this time is likely to be unauthorised. If you do plan to pull a sickie instead of going to work, at least avoid posting anything on social media!”

Let’s hope for the UK’s economy that England don’t go and win the 2018 version of the tournament, else the total money lost could become astronomical!",Sick as a Parrot?

“We’re getting Brad Pitt to play Harvey Weinstein. We also strong armed some famous actresses who profited from Harvey’s Midas touch to accelerate their careers to join the picture — although they deny anything happened way back when,” senior producer, Joel Steinberger said to LA Weekly.

As for the film’s plot and location, it has been revealed that it will revolve around multiple hotel locations around Beverly Hills and the greater Los Angeles area.

Emancipating female actresses

“We go from one hotel room to another. Plenty of massage oil, scripts, contracts and a lot of towels to mop up all the white goo. Weinstein will be portrayed as a champion to female actresses everywhere by emancipating them with his spilled seed,” Steinberger added.

The feel-good movie will reveal how Weinstein embraced women’s rights and feminism by supporting young actresses everywhere.

Contractual lubrication

“In the morning’s he would have two or three, then by the afternoon he would help four or five more actresses extend their careers. We’re thinking of calling the movie Fish Finger, ya know like Gold Finger, but this time with fishy fingers. Believe you me he had to dig deep for that one,” screenwriter Abel Cohen revealed.

Touted as the real deal story of Hollywood, the film will ejaculate onto screens and pot plants across America very soon.

According to reports coming from the Royal Saudi Kingdom, the French beret has been banned indefinitely and anyone caught wearing it will be punished with fines, then imprisonment and maybe stoning.

“We have seen people going around with French berets, and even some of them walking around with strings of garlic around their shoulders. They ride their bicycles through the city streets looking all French. It is absolutely disgusting behaviour and un-Islamic to say the least,” Rumbub al Hashmami, a religious leader from Riyadh’s largest mosque told the Saud Times.

Saudi men usually wear a white cloth and the women wear a full burka, Both sexes have been caught wearing berets over their clothes by religious police and reprimanded.

Yesterday after the ban was made known, there were cries of anguish in the streets.

“If I can’t wear my beret in the street, I will wear it at home. They can’t stop me doing that, honh, honh, honh!” Ansar al bin Dhakwan, a resident of Jeddah said angrily whilst being interviewed by Al Jazeera.

There are now calls for all Islamic countries in the Middle East to ban the French beret, and even as far east as Indonesia and Malaysia, there have been calls for a mass beret ban.",Saudi Arabia Bans the French Beret,http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/2377-saudi-arabia-bans-the-french-beret.html,www.dailysquib.co.uk

What happened to Bobby eh, he was great in the early days, Deer Hunter, King of Comedy, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Goodfellas, Casino, Heat, but now he has turned into some sort of sap who can only make threats to a president who is actually moving mountains and get parts in shit movies like The Intern. Who would have thought, De Niro’s politics were that of a red commie bastard? What a fucking douche.

Theresa May is a wet diarrhoea spillage not worthy of anything but the glue factory where they send old forgotten nags to get processed. She is a dead rotting carcass with no life, no chutzpa, no plan, and has wrecked Brexit simply because of her insipid lifeless non-personality, her purposeful stalling, and her treasonous Remainer appointees.

What did Obama achieve apart from introduce a failing health care system into America that is costing people way more for way less treatment? Obama lost the Ukraine to Russia. Obama spent trillions of U.S. taxpayers money on useless socialist pet projects that have doomed future generations of America to vast un-payable debt. When Obama was elected U.S. debt was 9 trillion, at the end of his eight year reign it was 23 trillion dollars.

Where is Barack Hussein Obama now? Who fucking cares? Him and his horrid cantankerous moose beast of a wife can rot in obscurity and Oprah appearances.

Trump has done more for African Americans than Obama ever did. He has brought massive employment to blacks, and also is not agitating the racial situation, something that Obama and his pal Soros tried to do during his evil term of office. The constant riots and agitating, the race baiting, was all Obama, who encouraged African Americans to riot pushing racial disharmony and hatred of white Americans.

History has spoken and Donald Trump has Trumped Obama a thousand times over.

As for Nobel Peace prizes, if Trump does not get one for his achievement in North Korea, then it is a flawed, biased prize, because Obama only got the prize for the colour of his skin, and he achieved nothing during his tenure.

You ever tried to do a bicycle kick wearing a full Hazmat chemical hazard suit in a World Cup final?

Well, the England boys are all suited up and ready for today’s training. Their destination is the 2018 World Cup in Russia, which will be a serious test for the team.

After a few minutes, there’s a breakaway, Jordan Henderson, the Liverpool midfielder suddenly checks his run, and parries through an instep drive towards centre. Unfortunately, due to the Hazmat suit, his shot hits a stopper, and the opposing side now delve deep into territorial danger bossing the game. After angling to the sweeper, then square passing to Harry Kane who runs the ball right up to the opposition’s line of retreat just outside the penalty box, he suddenly collapses with extreme heat exhaustion and cannot move. The goalie breathes a sigh of relief.

The perils of this dangerous endeavour are ever present. Half the team can barely run for fifteen minutes before suffering from heat exhaustion and fatigue wearing the heavy suits.

“It’s hard on the legs especially. Plus you try spitting phlegm in a Hazmat? You can’t spit, you can barely run, and your field of vision is shot to shit,” Jamie Carragher says from the sidelines.

It’s half time and the boys are knackered. There’s no way you can eat an orange segment let alone have a smoke in a fucking Hazmat.

Second half

Gareth Southgate, the manager comes out of his hut at 56 minutes and presses a red button. It’s a chemical nerve agent test to see if the England squad will survive.

If they have their Hazmat suits on and in proper nick, then it should be okay. Oh dear, one of the boys goes down, the gas got through a little gap as he didn’t put his head dress on properly. Poor bastard, looks like Rose, Tottenham left-back. He is carted off the pitch twitching like an altar boy in a Catholic church. After a few minutes the medics administer the antidote and the foam stops coming out of his mouth. He’s okay.

“I wanted to test the team. What if we’re two goals up on Russia, and they suddenly send in their nerve gas while we’re at the other end of the pitch to the Russian team? This is why it is essential our boys wear these suits. Not only could it save our lives but we could win games whilst under chemical attack, the cowardly Russians are dirty players, but we won’t let them get us,” Southgate later revealed.

Scum like Grieve are the ones who are now ruling the roost, and are supported by the PM as she instated these people into fray in the first place. Theresa May also instated Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, who has thwarted Brexit at every turn from within the Treasury and now pushes massive tax hikes to punish the people for daring to vote Brexit.

To be strung up from a lamp post by the neck is the only good outcome for Dominic Grieve and his Haw Haw brethren, as the people throw rotten tomatoes at the swinging traitor amidst the buzzards and flies. Of course, this is a figurative scenario, as these things do not happen today, however if there were to be a peoples uprising, you never know what could happen.

These Griefers are pushing the people to the limit.

What about the other treaties that were signed without any parliamentary say, or even any consultation of the people? The Lisbon Treaty was secretly signed away by Gordon Brown, and gave away much of Britain’s sovereignty. It was quickly taken through without even a consultation or murmur. No one of course mentions that, or any other pro-EU treaty that was secretly pushed through without any consultation or ‘Meaningful Vote’. These are double standards and hypocrisy.

Business 101, you cannot go to the deal table without the ability to walk away. If you do not have the ability to walk away, you have effectively lost any bargaining power, and are defenceless.

Under the new laws espoused by the Home Office, teens who commit their first murder will be cautioned and then given an on-the-spot fine of £20.00.

If the teens do not have the money upfront they will be reprimanded and required to pay the fine in instalments.

Two strikes and you’re out

Only when British teens commit murder twice will there be any grounds for a court appearance which may eventually lead to prosecution and possible jail time.

Courts in England and Wales have welcomed the Home Secretary’s decision and commended Ms Smith on freeing up valuable court time so they can continue prosecuting more motorists in England and Wales for minor driving offences.

The Labour think tank which pioneered the groundbreaking law has also been commended by the Prime Minister.



Gordon Brown will be discussing the new murder laws in next week’s cabinet meeting with a view to implementing them within six months.

Records dating to February 12, 1809 officially remark that Abraham Lincoln’s parents were Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks, however, there has been a new discovery which has put a new slant on the issue of parentage.

Abraham Lincoln’s mother was having an affair with a black plantation worker and new DNA evidence suggests that she somehow tricked her husband into believing that Abraham was the couples child. Secret love letters unearthed in 2003 reveal that Lincoln’s mother was conducting a clandestine affair with a slave named Iemis from a Kentucky plantation.

“We managed to attain DNA evidence from a lock of Abraham Lincoln’s hair which proves that he had a very strong African genetic link. His chromosome makeup is very specific to West African DNA patterns and this suggests that Abraham’s real father was indeed of African origin,” Dr. Alan Holdsworth, who is the chief Anthropologist on this project told National Geographic magazine.

The Obama campaign team, on hearing of the wonderful news have already started production of a short film to be aired on all networks next week.

Senator McCain’s campaign team are of course trying to refute the evidence collated by the scientific researchers as false and have demanded the team re-do the DNA analysis of Abraham Lincoln’s hair.

“Now we know why he was so vehemently opposed to slavery. Lincoln’s father was a slave. His mother, a poor white farmer’s wife had slept with a black slave and somehow concealed this fact from her husband.

These are supposedly inclusive people with an ideology of progressive tolerance and yet they are acting like fascists; non inclusive, intolerant, prone to censor, authoritarian, totalitarian and increasingly violent.

Hitler himself would be proud of the Democrats because they are exhibiting the exact behaviour of the Nazi party leading up to World War II. Hitler’s National Socialist party was a form of socialism and left wing, they were intolerant of other views, they censored heavily and shut down any form of free speech.

This is the left wing credo now, an intolerant, non inclusive hate mongering mob of thugs who cannot discuss anything in a civil educated manner.

Your own hatred for Trump creates more hatred, because you are stuck in the mindset of anger, you create more anger, and your unwillingness to discuss or even acknowledge anything that is not in your worldview creates more discord and alienation.

Against the baying democrat hounds answering the race baiting call for violent action from Maxine Waters, Trump is again, the civilised one. The same goes for Peter Fonda, asking for paedophiles to rape Trump’s 11-year-old son, Barron. Donald Trump is the civilised one.

To see Trump’s administrative staff hounded out of restaurants, confronted outside their homes, is similar in behaviour to the Jews in Nazi Germany being turfed out of shops and other public spaces.

There is no positive mature educated behaviour being exhibited by American socialists at the moment, and frankly, you are the bad guys, because you are acting like bad guys act in everything you are doing.

If it is violence the American socialists crave, then they would not fare well in a fight, because they don’t own guns, and don’t know how to shoot straight, whereas the conservatives do and can.

Every day, Trump is increasing in strength, power and stature, whilst the democrats are looking increasingly dilapidated and silly. This applies to the media companies, the Hollywood celebrities, the pseudo-Marxist fascist university professors indoctrinating their flock, and the bleeding heart socialist thugs who have to virtue signal at every point of their miserable insufferable existence.

Russian ultras are getting ready for England fans for the World Cup in Russia this summer.

No one in their right mind should go to Russia, especially after what happened at the Euro 2016 football hooligan event in Marseilles.

Russian Ultras do not drink alcohol before fighting events and are highly trained in fighting arts like Krav Maga, Russian Systema and other Spetsnaz fighting techniques.

Backed directly by Putin’s Kremlin, Russian Ultras are also highly organised during fighting sessions, overwhelming their opponents, then taking them down clinically, and brutalising them mercilessly even when down on the ground helpless.

Russian Ultras wear all black clothing, black hats and have specific legions, they meticulously plan their attacks utilising maps before each football event. They mark out areas where they will flank their opponents, planning strafing attacks as well as where they can corner their opponents and beat them senseless.

England fans have many major weaknesses, they are unorganised, untrained, and are usually drunk. These qualities are capitalised on by the Russians who utilise military techniques, and the fact that English fans are drunk and disorganised to maximum effect. The Russians will be fully sober of alcohol, although on amphetamines, and pure adrenaline.

Not only do the Russian Ultras have highly advanced attack formations and plans, but they also utilise sophisticated techniques to avoid any police contact. This means they can inflict as much damage as possible on England fans without reproach or fear of getting caught. Usually, this means many England fans are caught unaware, as the Russians appear out of nowhere and smash their opponents with ultimate brutality and no mercy, then swiftly dissapear.

It is certainly interesting that the Home Office has not called off the World Cup in Russia this summer for England fans, as they will be prime targets, especially after the recent Novichock chemical attack in Salisbury.

It is safe to say, therefore that England fans will be sitting ducks during the Russian World Cup and their lives will be in serious danger. The heavily trained Russian Ultras have been training hard in the gym and their special training camps for this specific event all year.

Gun control is a serious fact of life. If you are holding your prize Deagle primed with some .50 AE ammo and you can’t control the recoil, you might as well be pissing in the wind, this is why you need gun control.

You empty a clip, your reload time may be a life or death situation, this is why you need to reload fast, and have many magazines available for the next burst of fire, this is all about gun control.

Collateral damage, this is acceptable in the military but on the streets or home can get you locked up for good, therefore when you’re aiming, get the right target (the bad guy) for fuck’s sake. Gun control is a very important aspect of this situation otherwise you could end up with multiple instances of collateral damage.

What about jamming? If your weapon of choice is not properly maintained, cleaned and oiled, then you will get more instances of your firearm jamming due to fouling. You don’t want that to happen if you’re in a serious life threatening situation and firing a fully automatic or semi auto weapon. Revolvers are generally more reliable, but they still need to be maintained and under gun control.

Gun control is also about what gauge you use with your weapon. What can you handle well? Know your limits. It’s a toss up between blowing major holes in somebody or something or getting that accurate clean head shot into the cranium with little or no recoil.

Practice, practice, practice! If you don’t practice with your gun, you won’t know how to control the gun. This is why access to a good shooting range is invaluable.

Don’t forget, gun control is not only about controlling the gun but most of all controlling yourself. If someone cuts in line at the fast food restaurant, just let it go, sure you can say a few words, maybe have a fist fight, but no guns will be needed there. Gun control is mostly about responsibility. You should only ever use your weapon when in serious fear of your life, and mostly on your own property to protect your family and yourself.

Hopefully with these tips, you will adhere to good gun control and live a long happy life of liberty including the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms.

One can’t forget the sad demise of Colombia’s Andres Escobar, El Caballero del Futbol, who scored an own goal against the USA in the 1994 World Cup and was subsequently murdered in cold blood when he got home to Colombia, brutally shot by a gunman as he relaxed at a cafe.

The astounding England vs Colombia game last night at the Spartak stadium in Moscow was a tour de force of football and had spectators practically on their knees with excitement and anguish.

End to end, with England leading by one goal, the Colombians pulled an equaliser out of a magician’s hat in the last minute of the game via numero 13, defender, Yerry Mina.

Extra time to score that elusive goal, was elusive and we were onto penalties.

This is the clincher, England are notorious at being shit at taking penalties, but this time around they bit the bullet and knuckled down with an excellent ‘thwack!’ from Eric Dier finalising the tally, thus consigning the Colombian team to another lonely and apprehensive journey home back to South America.

Hopefully, Mateus Uribe and Carlos Bacca, who both missed their penalty shots, will be left in peace, and not gunned down just because some Cartagena cartel boss lost a bet.

723,723,2018-05-22 12:25:50+01:00,"LONDON - England - The biological part of humans will be totally synthesised and understood by future technology and subsequently superseded by technology.

The globe is on the cusp of a large future technological event that will change everything about how we as humans live on this planet.

This massive shift into a new epoch of technological advancement will be akin to the Industrial era of the 19th Century in Europe.

In essence, the changes that will be incorporated will have vast significant repercussions but will essentially be a huge leap forward.

The technology that will change humanity forever is something that many will be scared by at first.

Much of the biological body is not necessary, and humans have hardly evolved in thousands of years.

We are still adapted to an existence thousands of years in the past. Future technological advances will thus incorporate nano machines within the body.

There will not be any need to eat or breathe as microscopic machines sustain us from the inside.

Backing-up your computer hard drive is a necessity, and it is incomprehensible that the human mind cannot be backed-up today. How many great scientific, artistic, literate minds have been lost so far? The future will ensure this never happens again, and we will be able to back-up our minds in full.

Medical science is still in the stone age, even though some are trying to move forward, possibly ahead of their time.

To augment, to enhance, to evolve. This is why brain implantation technology will revolutionise humanity in a huge leap in evolution. To begin first though, scientists will have to map out every dendrite, every neuron, every synapse and axon — a task that is enormous considering the fact that every human brain is different and unique.

Coupled with advancements in robotics, and artificial intelligence, humans will be able to formulate new ways of transport, and a new understanding of our universal standing.

Creating sentient beings that will be able to design, adjust and build other sentient beings will be the ultimate step towards a future that will enable earthlings to colonise new worlds across the universe.

This is why science and technology must be funded to the highest levels now, why we must put all of our efforts into making that evolutionary leap forward.

The future need not be a Brave New World, but one of ultimate technological creativity, of limitless possibilities encouraged to the full and not encased in moral boundaries and legal limitations.

Enhancing humans, amalgamating with machinery is the future, and from there all the current problems of humanity can be solved.

Some may say that conquering death through technology is a loss of humanity and soul, this is where they are wrong because everything in this universe has its own vibration, and a reason for existence.",Experts: Big Technological Shift Coming Soon,http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/sci_tech/28665-experts-big-technological-shift-coming-soon.html,www.dailysquib.co.uk
724,724,2018-05-31 13:04:24+01:00,"All it takes is a few words, a few well chosen words can make or break people on Twitter. People have been arrested for words on Twitter, people have lost their jobs, people have been made social outcasts and ostracised…just from a few words.

How can we rationalise this extreme power that a few well or not well chosen words can impact so highly on either yourself or others?

There is no doubt that words have power, however when put in a certain spotlight, there is an almost exponential rise in the power of those words.

Analysing the goldfish bowl prison of Twitter, it is a bacterial incubator of human brain farts, and people do say some silly things, including so-called celebrities. In this light, should people be accountable for such brain farts? Not necessarily…

What is all this seriousness about? Are we not all creative, chaotic creatures flailing around in the cold hard digital blackness? If someone makes a brain fart, they somehow got their fingers to compute the brain fart and put it onto the public notice board of Twitter. That single brain fart is not and should not sum up a complete human being. We as humans have numerous facets, we have numerous levels to our being, and it is sad that many are judged just for one singular mistake, some little thought that came out wrong, or that proverbial brain fart that somehow leaked out onto the keyboard.

Is this our future? A future where we cannot make mistakes? Not even once, are we allowed to transgress, or move in a diagonal off beat way?

Maybe it is cultural Marxism that is now so pervasive it is intoxicating, and stepping out of line with the PC mono-culture, the Sovietized conformity where everyone speaks in the same way, everyone thinks in the same simplistic ways is the norm. Imagine a vast grey landscape and billions of grey people come marching along, singing the same bland song and wearing the same grey clothes. THIS is what the internet is turning into, where all the free-thinkers, the true creatives and the eccentrics of the world are whittled down into a morose grey dust.

Without the dreamers, the creatives and the exuberant eccentric characters, everything is stale, joyless and bland.

This is why we should celebrate the brain fart, we should celebrate the mistakes that people make, and any creative person knows, there are happy accidents we make that sometimes formulate themselves into big ideas, big solutions, and off centre thinking creating radical changes that impact the whole of humanity.

Do not fire people for words, do not arrest them? This is a form of tyranny, a form of totalitarian nastiness that George Orwell warned about. We should all be able to express ourselves however wrong, abhorrent or offensive it may seem to one certain group, or another clique or a whole swathe of people.

As an artist, if people are offended by your work, then you are doing something right. You have touched people, and this is what artists do.

To evolve as humans, we must therefore diverge from what there is now. Mistakes should not be punished, because making mistakes in life is a profound tool for growth, of course, this runs into the ultimate cliche that we learn more from our mistakes than we do from our successes.

This is why Roseanne, should never be fired for her words on Twitter. She has now had her show cancelled by the ABC network, and she made some mistakes, she mouthed off, but even though we may not agree with her, we should still defend her right to say what she said with our lives.

Freedom of speech means protecting all speech, including anything that is deemed offensive, or off centre. Everything and everyone should be allowed to express themselves…because this is the only way humanity will truly grow…without that, there is only a one-sided view.

What about double standards? It is apparently okay for a comedian on the American left to show off a decapitated head of a president, yet to make silly remarks about Planet of the Apes is not permissible.

If this means a furious Michelle Obama demanding Roseanne’s cancellation directly to the boss of Disney, we ask ourselves, who has the power today in America?

That being said, at the end of the day, in this age, should humans still be punishing other humans for something they have no control over — the colour of their skin they were born with?

You are born this way, you cannot change it, you cannot change your race, your DNA or genome…so why punish people for something they cannot change?

725,725,2011-11-17 09:10:00+01:00,"LONDON - England - After the spate of thefts and desecration of war memorials across Britain by scrap metal thieves, the government plans to replace the remaining metal memorials with plastic ones.

Across Britain, thousands of metal thieves have stolen copper, iron and lead memorial plaques and statues to melt down and sell to scrap yards for cash.

“These are mainly Eastern European gangs who were let in with the government’s open door immigration policy for the UK. They take any metals they can find then sell them off for cash,” councillor Graham Chubb, for Camden council told the Daily Mail newspaper.

The new plastic and rubber memorials will be produced cheaply and will be worth nothing to the thieves.

“I think we should have a few veterans standing by the memorials with a Lee-Enfield or Bren gun, shoot the buggers when they turn up in their vans,” Raymond Chandler, 87, a former paratrooper told the Sun.

726,726,2017-07-03 12:11:59+01:00,"WASHINGTON D.C. - USA - Melania Trump has revealed in a Hello magazine exclusive that the president has a problem with flatulence, especially during important meetings.

“We were meeting the Saudi King when Donald let off a large ripping fart. We all waited for a second, then the smell wafted around. Imagine a bouquet of rotten eggs, sardines, mouldy cheese alongside curdling milk and fermenting sewage, and you get the picture. Naturally, my husband did the honourable thing and ignored it, whilst the Saudi King was seen retching and looking around wildly for an escape route.”

Mrs Trump, always the pleaser, also describes how her husband farts with such gusto in bed, that he actually stains the bed sheets, and they have to be changed every hour by White House cleaners.

“He eats the regular stuff. He has three or four steaks every day, lots of eggs and burritos by the dozen. We are not sure what is causing the problem as everything is organic and gluten free?” Melania Trump revealed in the interview.

With such a productive gut, there are concerns amongst White House aides on what could happen when the Trumps visit the Royal family in Britain in December.

“Royal protocol is rather strict however having a U.S President farting copiously in front of the Queen could be quite amusing and bring an air of comedy to proceedings. We are sure Her Majesty has seen and heard a lot more in her time, especially with the Duke and his legendary rippers,” palace spokesman, Giles Humble, revealed on Monday.",Melania: When Donald Farts He is Always a Gentleman,http://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/25641-melania-donald-farts-always-gentleman.html,www.dailysquib.co.uk
